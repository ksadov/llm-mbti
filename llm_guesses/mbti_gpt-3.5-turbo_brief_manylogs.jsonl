{"submission": "The most consistent thing I've heard about myself all life is that I'm stubborn and impulsive. I often act on my whims without thinking about consequences. I've done and said many things that I regret. I think about future to some degree but it's more like set of imagines of things I would like to try or see or accomplish than concentrate plans.\nI have hard time making choices. Once I focus on one thing there's other that pop up in my head and I constantly ping pong between different ideas. I moved from town to town most times that any person I know. New month - new crush. I changed my college major few times, to be honest still don't know what I want/should do. Being trapped in something that I don't feel like doing or not good at got me scared. I really want to achieve something, be expert at what I do and being unbeaten, irreplaceable. I can lie about things just to impress someone, appear cooler than I'm. My life is never enough, always feel like there is something missing, like now I have amazing  supportive loving bf yet I can't wait to love be something greater than than like things we see in movies/books, I'm never satisfied with what I have. Sometimes I think that whole my life I'll be chasing some amazing thing that will never become reality. One of the worst things you can do to me is not remembering me. It's make me angry, not matter how many years passed by since the last time we saw each other or for how long we knew each other. When I walk into room I want my presence to be noticeable and make impression. I don't actually care if you think how nice or evil I'm as long as I blow you over I'm fine with it. \nMy bf once told me if we ever break up it would be leaving, he's the emotional one in our relationship and I could leave if I met someone or have other exiting opportunity and just feel like it. And it was one of the most insightful things someone ever told about me. What if the thing with some else could be more amazing than what you have? \nI want to be one of these people who feels like sunshine, who people ask for advice or turn to with any kind of problem. When I walk into room I want my presence to be noticeable and make impression. \nI can easily and immediately express emotion. When I mad at someone or feel sad I can immediately talk about it and explain why and how I feel. In relationships with people I have need to know everything about them, what they are thinking, feeling, they dreams, I feel bad when I find out they didn't share their problems with me. When I think about my loved ones I think about as as team and hope to go through things together. I can easily spot when someone is feeling down or happy. While I can be blunt at times and say what I think in hard way I care about well being of these around me. But I'm not someone who put others before myself and think people split on better and worse ones. When I'm out with friends but don't drink they often joke if I'm sure because I act bubbly, fun and outgoing - meeting with people energize me and put in good mood. Of course certain people can drag me down but definitely not all. \nI can be most objective person and have ability to see every side of conflict. Life isn't black and white and get mad when people think I'm arguing when I just explain different perspectives. I want to know what's going on behind scenes and people motives. I get very excited about things and like learning/trying it out but mostly likely to touch subject superficialy. \nSometimes I feel like I live more in my dreams than in reality but I also like doing things. New places or cuisines from different countries. I get easily fascinated by things/ideas/people. I tend to steal personality or look of people/characters I'm amazed by. \nLong detailed things bore me, even if it's just recipes. I make a lot of list and plans but mostly fail to finish anything I started or even go from planning to actually doing it.\nI need logical consistency in life. I need things to make sense to me whether it's my friend decision or end of mystery novel. I ended up not liking a lot of books because of their endings, like this person couldn't be murder I won't accept that solving. I still can't get over fact that Bridget Jones in last film choose Marc Darcy over second guy. They clearly don't got along that well so why don't try with someone who  is also great and have a great chemistry? And if her and Mark are soulmates like movie try to convince us they'll eventually find their way to each other.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/167d6he)", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": "ENFP", "logprobs": {"EN": [{"token": "EN", "logprob": -0.09161184}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -3.135849}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -3.2614117}, {"token": " ES", "logprob": -5.909691}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -6.7276325}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.8783073}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.444054}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.176083}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -9.332649}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -9.528902}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.542225}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -10.099329}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -10.570179}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.734398}, {"token": "En", "logprob": -10.8741}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -11.127665}, {"token": "Ex", "logprob": -11.197237}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -11.405373}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -11.411297}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.543364}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.00025716738}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -8.309439}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.116587}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -12.184282}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -16.70429}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -16.776917}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -16.955227}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -17.356958}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -17.570824}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -17.871351}, {"token": "SP", "logprob": -17.889566}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -17.984732}, {"token": "EP", "logprob": -19.027412}, {"token": "_FP", "logprob": -19.378538}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -19.679344}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -19.693178}, {"token": "fp", "logprob": -19.836962}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -19.956621}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -20.056734}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -20.088697}]}}

{"submission": "I technically went to elementary and middle school with her, although I will note that we never directly interacted (I did interact with her younger sister, though.) She is the middle child - she has an older sister, and a younger sister. I remember that when we were all rather young, her mother was a photographer (that her sister had actually been in a magazine) and her mother is a housewife - her family is not \u201cpoor\u201d in spite of it, by any means. They live comfortably, and may even be upper middle class. \n\nI will note that she is someone who definitely strikes me as being extroverted, even if you just glance through her social media (well, especially if you just glance through her social media.) Both of her accounts - her main account, and what I would *kind of* think of as being her spam account (has a silly username, \u201cyour hot friend\u201d) are public, and her main account has over 1,000 followers. There is a recent post on her \u201cspam\u201d account wherein she posts a caption saying that she had some beer (and actually posts a picture where she is holding a beer bottle, even though I think she\u2019s only a year older than me - nineteen) and notes that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like it\u201d (she posted in all caps \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d) She actually posts herself pouring it down the drain (in two of the pictures.) She also posted, beforehand, that she \u201cmade the family watch Tyler Childers music video\u201d with photographs of how her younger sibling and parents reacted. She has posted in a bikini a few different times on her main and \u201cspam\u201d accounts. She has a Tik Tok where she jokingly suggests that she thinks a certain character was \u201cgay\u201d for Gatsby. She has a conventionally attractive body - to me personally, she is more average than anything else overall - but does not seem to have ever had a boyfriend. I notice that she tends to look happy in photos, moreso than her siblings. She seems the most likely to me of her three siblings to have a child (it wouldn\u2019t shock me if none of them did, but she just seems like the one who would be most open to it.) \n\nShe has been friends again for a few years with a childhood friend of hers who she had a falling out with in middle school (the childhood friend said something to her when they were sitting together that seriously offended her.

{"submission": "Looking for MBTI typing help, but I would also enjoy insight on other typology theories (esp socionics bc its slightly similar)\n\nI would also appreciate anyone willing to go more in depth and give me more questions / a typing session\n\n\n\nManifestations of my cognitive functions\n\nTe\n1. See the importance, but not necessarily good at it\n2. It feels like an expectation I hardly fulfil\n3. Enjoy planning but rarely commit to big plans\n4. Prioritise efficiency in simpler tasks\n5. Ie: My first instinct is to try thinking out of the box to find what I think the best way of doing something is (some might say is Ne)\n6. I can differentiate Te and Fi, but it can be tough choosing between them due to (2) and also because I value Fi\n\nFi\n7. I\u2019m constantly thinking about what I like, value, and my stand on certain topics\n8. This makes me quite stubborn, self centred and emotional (I tend to have outbursts of emotions)\n9. I used to express controversial opinions a lot when common beliefs did not make sense to me, but I have learnt from the backlash and now try to express them less, though my thoughts haven\u2019t changed\n10. My morals are usually guided by reasoning, where I need to be able to explain why certain rules should be followed (a trend I see is that most of them end up at \u201crights\u201d, which is hard for me to explain further)\n11. Smaller traits like needing to have a special identity and being into typology-ish things all my life might be related to Fi\n\nFe\n12. I enjoy a harmonious group (ie. social practices that everyone follows) (but not in a situation where this turns possibly oppressive), even though I don\u2019t really go with the flow and neglect my own needs \n13. I kind of value the socionics definition of it. I love strong emotional atmospheres. Like listening to melancholic songs and feeling the emotional expressions of the instrumentals and vocals. \n13.5. When it comes to actually expressing emotions, I can\u2019t find the right words, I use metaphors and pictures.\n14. I often act oblivious to social tension because I do not know how to deal with them, though I can be easily influenced\n15. However, I have observed that I am not well aware about the people around me, I live in my own world\n16. I\u2019m gradually learning about the importance of Fe matters (its more about maturing ig)\n\nTi\n17. I\u2019m very into analysing and creating systems, hierarchies and categories\n18. I feel the need to rephrase everything I learn in a way I can understand better\n19. A dislike for ambiguity makes me search for an explanation / reason behind everything (eg. delving into philosophy and quantum physics even though I do not intend on any actual practical use, or just asking questions in my mind frequently and reflecting on observations)\n20. I cannot live with a jumble of unfiltered information, and I need things to make sense (It\u2019s hard to explain but basically everything needs to link together nicely and I need to make sure I have everything) (Love mind maps)\n21. Although I place value on Ti, it is hard for me to be completely logical, impersonal and objective in my decision making\n\n\nSe\n22. Most manifestations of this are related to the socionics definition of Si (ie. I enjoy indulging in comfort, I often choose whatever is physically easier)\n23. But it\u2019s not that I prioritise immediate physical comfort over everything else (ie. I try to be eco-friendly despite any slight inconveniences it may cause)\n24. I like thinking about the optimal space and state I would like to be in \n25. I can get quite sensitive to some sensory experiences (eg. it\u2019s hard to sleep unless its completely dark and silent, having to wash my feet whenever I step into the kitchen)\n26. It is quite difficult for me to be \u201cin the moment\u201d, as I space out a lot, though this may be due to factors such as the rise in social media scrolling\n\n\nNi\n27. Ni is like the \u201ccome and go\u201d function for me, where it\u2019s really like the \u201caha moment\u201d that appears every now and then, but I do not get to hung up on them because I need the security of accuracy (19)\n28. I do place interest and value on Ni stereotypes like symbolisms and dreams (I have a diary just for dreams), but of course, this isn\u2019t a good way to type \n\nNe\n29. I can often \u201cspit out ideas like a machine gun\u201d, except for in situations under extreme stress or when I really don\u2019t know anything about the given topic\n30. Again, stereotypes, but I\u2019ve been commonly described as creative all my life\n31. I do frequently bounce on different ideas and it is hard for me to commit to one unless I\u2019ve spent enough time with it and got attached (I get attached easily)\n32. I blame Ne on my constant oversharing and annoying explosions of messages sent to my friends\n33. Despite all that, I doubt that I have fully mastered this function, I\u2019m not good at constantly churning out new ideas on the spot for an extended time and keeping conversations going\n\n\nSi\n34. Probably quite strong, I want the security of proven sustainable methods when I get really stressed out and uncertain\n35. Points in (22)\n36. I\u2019m often scolded for being careless, I don\u2019t notice small details, except for when I\u2019m casually staring at a building analysing its structure etc\n37. I guess I am a person of habits, I naturally fall into the same routines without noticing\n38. Sensory association is pretty common for me, I look at aesthetics, themes (and concepts) and they just become registered in my mind as a fuzzy ball ready to be connected to other stuff.

{"submission": "1) Happiness is overrated. I don't understand people's need for constant pursuit of happiness. Happiness is a fleeting and unstable thing. I want peace. I don't strive to have Happiness in life, I want peace. Things will never be happy 24/7. I will feel sadness, anger, stress, and love. There is a beauty to every emotion. Sadness allows you to feel every little thing. Anger fuels passion. Love drives us forward. Happiness let's us stay in the present. Stress helps us avoid mistakes and mishaps. Peace is accepting that there is a beautiful balance in all emotions. To say you only want Happiness is minimizing the beauty and need for the other emotions. I want peace in life and the ability to take things as they come, process them, and move through them. I haven't achieved complete peace but its my goal in life, not Happiness. \n\n2) Our values are stronger when they come from logic rather than emotions. Emotions are unstable and often inconsistent. If your values were based on emotion, they would be prone to shifting from feeling to feeling, never maintaining a set of core values. Logical values (personal or subjective values) are much stronger because there is a reason for them, a system we can rely on to justify our feelings, a way to maintain fairness in our values. For example, I find it odd that peoples view on eating meat to be an emotional value. When it's emotional, it's unfair. Which animals you deem \"ok\" to eat is essentially based on how cute you find them. That's not fair. I find the logic value should look at the emotional intelligence of an animal to determine the Morality of eating it. Or even have consistency and either think all animals are ok or none are.

{"submission": "Hi! I'd like some outside perspective on my type. I'm so deep into MBTI I can't judge myself accurately anymore and I keep getting really different results ...\n\n \n\n*Personal concepts*\n\n* **What is beauty? What is love?**\u00a0\n\nThat's a very complicated question. Beauty can be aesthetic beauty, as it can also be found in beautiful emotions, such as when something moves you or you feel at ease and in tune with the moment. Love is beautiful as well, I'd define it as a deep fondness of the thing that's loved. \n\n* **What are your most important values?**\u00a0\n\nImprovement, open mindedness, equality, honesty, duty, depth, passion\n\n* **Do you have any sort of spiritual/religious beliefs, and why do you hold (or don't) those beliefs in the first place?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI'm naturally skeptical, but as a good skeptic, I doubt both my earthly and my spiritual side. I have now come to accept both. \n\nI've believed in God for a short time in my childhood, because my friend at the time was a firm believer and she explained religion to me as if it was factual and that's what led me to believe her. Nonetheless, I could never feel a natural faith in religion and, eventually, I found arguments that explained every gap religion sought to explain, and I no longer had any reason to have that faith anyway.\n\n I must say, though, that I am a spiritual person. I am into astrology, energies and things of that sort, although I wouldn't stand by their veracity. Nonetheless, I can still feel connected to mysticism, it feels right, and some things have happened in my life that have made me at least question my beliefs. \n\nI believe now that your spiritual life doesn't have to rely on facts, the point is to let go of pure rationality. As humans, we have a spiritual side which it's interesting to explore, and the mere fact of the universe's existence is crazy enough for me to be open minded to anything being true.\n\n* **Opinion on war and militaries? What is power to you?**\u00a0\n\nI hate this question. Obviously war is not a good thing. Power to me is just a totally arbitrary system that we have created as humans to distribute opportunities and resources. I'm ok with leadership, and I find it necessary in a lot of cases, but being a leader shouldn't make you more important than the rest of the group. I'm always appalled when I think of how leaders would have no power if we just stopped listening to them, they're just as human as you and I, but they're up there because people obey them, and people obey them because half of the time their lives are at risk and the other half of time they benefit from that person being powerful. \n\nEvaluation & Behaviour\n\n* **What have people seen as your weaknesses? What do you dislike about yourself?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPeople have described me as weird, controlling, selfish, overly sensitive, distant, tactless, rude...\n\nI can see where these criticisms come from, but I believe I just have a really hard time with social cues, which makes me be perceived unfairly. I do admit I tend to overstep my boundaries and meddle in people's issues trying to fix them. I think my biggest flaw is actually being perfectionistic. I know this can sometimes be useful, but it turns against me making me unsatisfied with life, it's hard to maintain a stable self steem since I judge myself a lot for my mistakes, and I'm also really hard on others.\n\n* **What have people seen as your strengths? What do you like about yourself?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPeople have described me as intelligent, unique, good at expressing myself, helpful, genuine, mature, good\n\nI like my depth, my mind is a very interesting place to live in, I also like that I am reliable, passionate and driven. I am energetic, interesting and fun, and also very honest and spontaneous.\n\n* **Ever feel stuck in a rut? If yes, describe the causes and your reaction to it.**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot really, if I feel stuck I just try to move forward, but I'm always planning some kind of change in my life so it doesn't happen often. When it has happened, it might be because I'm feeling down and it's hard to get out of bed and do stuff, or I might be wondering when things will get better. I usually get out of the rut by finding a solution or making a decision, or just waiting because I know it won't be long til I'm back on my feet.\n\n**People & Interactions**\n\n* What qualities do you most like and dislike in other people? What types do you get along with?\u00a0\n\nI dislike fake people, I find it very hard to relate to socially conforming people, and I like interesting and intelligent people. I have a wide array of friends, my friends are usually people I admire for their personality and values. I get along with XNTP, IXFP, INFJ, ESTP. Ti and Fi users mostly...\n\n* **If you were to raise a child, what would be your main concerns, what measures would you take, and why?**\n\nMy main concern would be to raise them properly and not give them any trauma lol. I'd inform myself as best as I can to give them the best life possible, as it would make me very happy and fulfilled to give someone a chance to live a happy and fulfilling life.\n\n* **A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward and outward reaction?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI'm usually a bit taken aback, I might judge them internally at first, and then I'd try to see where they're coming from and I'd give my opinion. I don't usually let it show when I don't agree, as I don't want them to feel judged, but I let it be known (does that make sense?).\n\n* **How do you choose your friends and how do you behave around them?**\n\nMy friends are people whom I'm comfortable and I can be myself with, and I connect with them on a deeper level. I'm usually really genuine and barely hold anything back, I'm also quite insecure and worry what they think of me. I'm affectionate and honest.\n\n* **How do you behave around strangers?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nDepends on the context. If I'm at a party, I can act sociable, fun and I'm not as shy. I try to make things interesting and get to know new people. If I'm meeting people that are not my equals (teachers, older people...), I'm really reserved and cautious, I inhibit myself a lot, and I can't bring myself to be fake-nice even if it's good for the situation. On the other hand, if it's my equals but it's not a party situation, I'm also reserved, I'm not shy but I don't seek out interaction either unless something about them has caught my eye or they approach me first. \n\nExtra: Thank you if you've read all this, hope it wasn't too long. If it's worth something, I have spent an embarrassing amount of time on this post because I keep rewriting and selecting different questions and, oh well, I don't know what that says about me but it might be relevant lol. \n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.24150012}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.9606965}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.078481}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -3.7958577}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.2898016}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.895175}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.02975}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -7.8403273}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -8.771146}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.824544}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.827983}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.261416}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -9.403466}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.613124}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.721007}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -10.114236}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -10.382258}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -10.558869}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -10.595614}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.60143}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0046139457}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -5.6918945}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -7.4530163}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.159542}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -8.45838}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -9.613749}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -10.556311}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -11.141024}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.540237}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -12.017704}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -12.762083}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -12.836943}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.145851}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -13.240145}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.340727}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.75378}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -13.9573345}, {"token": "_", "logprob": -14.026527}, {"token": "_x", "logprob": -14.100452}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.105633}]}}
{"submission": "Sorry if some of my answers are too long or not exactly what these questions mean I'm just really interested in them or I was getting scatterbrained and tried to come up with an answer.\n\nI have been thinking of creating a type me post for a month now and never got to it so here we go..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am a 13 year old girl. I'm pretty aware of things in my life if that helps, like for example I know whats right and wrong (not letting people take advantage of me, knowing the signs, etc? It makes sense to me but I can't really describe it) but I'm trying to figure out if its me being aware or just common sense since I can't find a good word for it.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNo\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don't have a job\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI don't know I can't really think of how I would feel I'd have to be in the situation to know exactly but I think I would just be relaxed, and kinda lonely? Maybe I would be refreshed if I were exhausted from the week/day before or I really wanted alone time.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI never really thought about it, I like sports maybe I only like the idea of them and I've never tried any sports. I would only play a sport if I felt comfortable playing it, I like to think that I'm just too lazy to do sports but really I'm just awkward atleast thats my description because when I think about sports Im worried I'll embarrass myself I wouldn't beat myself up about it though because I don't really care but I care yk? I would rather spend years practicing than go in with little practice. For some reason I feel that sports are embarrassing, not for other people but for me I cant really explain it well.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI don't think I'm really curious I don't spend my day thinking about what could be or how something can change. If I am thinking about something I would say its probably conceptual most of the time like if I see a picture about space or some video about it I'll be curious and start thinking, \"Well what if \\_\\_\\_?\" or \"Wow so many unknown things\"\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nCan't say, I would need to be in the situation to answer this\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to LOVE art, drawing was my favorite thing to do and I would spend hours every day and more during summer drawing, doing origami, or making pockets for my supplies in notebooks or just the pages with glue or tape, I would have just stacks on stacks of art and I think I had about 4 notebooks that I used to draw in. I really liked digital art too, my art wasnt and still isn't really good but I dont care much because It's something I enjoyed doing and I still get really happy and in the zone when I draw or do something creative like mess around with glue and craft.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI don't care much for either too much, maybe sometimes I'll compare/remember the past and future with what is in the present but I'm usually just in the present, I think that I am a more in the moment person because after events or hangouts etc I cant feel the way I felt in the moment so I really like to stay in the present more so I can feel it. I don't know exactly what you mean by how do you deal with them but I'll try to answer. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nDepends on what it is, If it's something I know how to do or I can do it then I would say yes. If I do decide to help them I don't really know why I would do it, I just do.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nNot really.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nImportant but not super important.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don't think I control others, but if I did it would probably be because of something personal? Or what I'm feeling, I don't know exactly how though.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI don't really have any hobbies now.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is visual I think (I took a test before answering this). Sorry I won't answer the other questions because I can't think\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'd say I am okay at strategizing. Sometimes I wing it and sometimes I improvise or sometimes I do both so I can't say much for this question.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nHonestly I don't really know. I just want to be rich to where I won't have to work or have a comfortable job, thats my goal.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy only fears are the dark and rollercoasters, rollercoasters just make me uncomfortable because its not really scary but you can just feel your stomach drop and the wind doesn't make it better, even if I close my eyes I know I am on it and I would think to myself about if it's just some internal issue but I'd rather not. The dark is just self explanatory (I think thats the right word) its the DARK, what's inside of it? I would rather be in a room with light where I can see EVERYTHING than be in a room where I can't see anything, I've thought about it and even if I were in the dark with headphones blasting and nothing to see to give me the illusion I am safe what if something were to grab me. And now I see this answer is getting way too long so I'll stop here.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI feel like I am just unable to daydream, I can have a good imagination but trying to visualize in my head about things (I think thats what daydreaming is? unless it can be me and my thoughts then I will say no I don't daydream often) and dreams doesn't work for me so I would say I am pretty attached to reality. I pay a lot of attention to whats around me, but not in a super spy threat detected way. I'm more observing, in my head, when I walk into a room i pay attention to whats in it. (people, whats on the walls?, how I feel, what I should do)\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nAnything, but I won't leave that as an answer because If someone gave me that answer I would be confused. If I were in that situation maybe I would think about how weird it is or something like, \"Wow is this what it's like to be literally lonely?\"\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI think I take pretty long, I'm trying to think of what I did in the past but I can't really think of what I did before. I don't usually change my mind when I make decisions unless I should or think its a better thing to do.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI think I process my emotions a little slow, I find that I'm kinda mood swingy like if I'm crying or feeling something I'll just be thinking about the situation that made me feel that way, I don't ask why but in my head if needed I comfort myself like, \"\\[my name\\] It's okay\"\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNo\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't break rules often or ever. I don't think authority should be challenged or that they know better, if they arent doing anything that harms then its whatever? I'm not a rule breaker, I'm too scared depending on what it is but if were at my lowest I feel I would be prone to just give up and say yolo. I'm like that kid who never played ding dong ditch with the rest of the group because I felt it was too scary not really scary but like \"what if\" scary (covering it up with \"I am just too lazy\" or \"I don't wanna\") and also I just felt I shouldn't.

{"submission": "(1) I view the world through a subjective, self-referential lens. I both consciously and unconsciously make judgements on right / wrong, good / bad based off of how I would like things to be. I have a hard time accepting the world for what it is, always wishing things would be better.\n\n(2) I have a soft heart and have fallen for sob stories. I believe what little I can to help those in need, I will do to the extent of my ability. I sympathize with others by seeing myself in others or if it\u2019s a cause that I can resonate with. I can get to the point where I feel sad when I realize I can\u2019t do enough to help others realize my ideals for them (especially when it happens to be their own), and I feel like I\u2019m constantly struggling against the way the world is, but on a deep level I still believe that kindness and goodness will ultimately be rewarded.\n\n(3) I am not confident in things requiring a high amount of attention to physical skills, reflexes, and meticulous attention to appearances. I am skeptical of, and tend to be wary of people that live physically / dangerously, or people that I feel put a lot of attention into the way they look or are overly concerned with coming off the \u201cright\u201d way.\n\n(4) It is difficult for me to truly admire or look up to anyone. I am aware that there\u2019s often a lot more than what they show the world, and that everyone ultimately walks their own path. There is only one me, no one else can be me.\n\n(5) I have a tendency to eat the same food, go to the same places, and listen to the same music over and over again. I tend to categorize knowledge, remember facts, and use what I feel are trusted sources so I can build up a reference catalogue of information. When I make a decision, I cast the net wide, gather as much info as I feel I need to, and pick what I feel is the best option. However, I tend to be a procrastinator and indecisive.\n\n(6) I am aware of and can understand feelings that don\u2019t come from the same basis as my own, but when I have to make a choice, it\u2019s hard for me to ignore my own feelings and go with what I feel is the most right to me. For example, a friend of mine had someone close to them die. I would give basic condolences, but if I felt that the person was not a good person in my view, I will also let the friend know how I really feel about him / her and feel it\u2019s my duty to let my friend have an accurate understanding of what really went on in their relationship.\n\n(7) It\u2019s difficult for me to travel somewhere and only see the \u201cup sides\u201d of the place, I tend to be naturally skeptical of say, certain travel YouTubers who are cheesy and extremely positive about everywhere they go, when I feel like I would have to get at least a decent understanding of the actual social and political issues so as to come to a more truthful understanding. This ties closely to an interest in history and sociology.\n\n(8) I don\u2019t have a keen understanding or grasp of aesthetics, a lot of things I approach from a very functional perspective. Don\u2019t count on me to decorate a beautiful home. I don\u2019t like being tied down by \u201cstuff\u201d, with the rare exception, because I value mobility and I feel like I can better engage my feelings, my thoughts, and have meaningful experiences when I don\u2019t have to focus a lot on the materialistic world. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m as in touch with hot / cold, physical sensations as some other people are.\n\n(9) When I feel anxious, I become more critical and combative, a bit more aggressive than usual. I find fault in everyone and everything, and I feel strongly driven by a desire to correct things and make them simpler, better, but I am also very lacking in organizational skills. I feel highly repressed and tied down by rules and expectations, because I feel like they assume guilt before innocence when they don\u2019t even know me on a personal level or my intentions. I guess you can say I have a problem with authority. The fastest way for me to lose respect for someone is when someone uses their position of power to step over me, instead of using their personal qualities to make them deserve my respect.\n\n(10) I am not entirely rejecting of tradition and convention, but I MUST interpret them and follow them in a way that suits ME and makes ME comfortable. External expectations and pressures, I don\u2019t thrive under them at all.\n\n(11) Through both life experiences and self-analysis, I believe that the right people will come to me. It\u2019s futile trying to fit in and gain the favor of a group that never intended to view me as an equal in the first place.\n\n(12) My way of informing is dumping it all, giving all the knowledge I feel the other person needs.\n\n(13) I am at my best when sharing ideas, rather than creating.

{"submission": "I hope this post will gather some informed folks.   \n\n\nHello there. This is my first time posting on Reddit after several months of cultivating information about MBTI from some of you. I don't really like to resort to asking people even though I know it would help to understand MBTI typing. Of course, I know this sub would have a lot of people as \"not so\" informed as me, but I also read a few of you who have a very great grasp of what MBTI is. That alone, I think, would be worth a shot, given how exhausted I am reading some points I clearly do not understand.\n\nI really don't know how to start, so I would answer the guide questions the sub provided. May you continue reading, thanks!  \n\n\n**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am female and just turned 22 last month. I am quite interested in everything, except sitting down and doing the same thing. I was really interested in programming. I even started teaching myself, BUT I got tired after some time. It was one of my dreams to learn to program, but my focus is just so bad sometimes. One day I had it, next week I didn't. I wanted to have a routine, but I am bad at making it. But if someone would help me, and mentor me, that would be excellent because I am very good at learning things. I am also excellent at following directions. Although I would question it sometimes, I am very good at producing results. Maybe, I really just need some determination.\n\n**Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**\n\nI never had any medical condition that would greatly impact my mental stability. Though, I think I have to mention that I am anemic. This condition actually influenced my concentration as I would get tired easily. But, because I am currently taking iron supplements, the symptoms are not as strong as they were before. I am healthy, though not as active as I was before. \n\n**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy mother is very religious. She would not let me play outside unless I was done praying with her. This is not the type that would get me beaten up if I refused, but I did get intense stares so I never really had the chance to refuse. Clearly, I am just afraid to do it. Yet, I did remember getting scolded after fighting over a chalk with a neighbor while she was praying. That's where I got some little discipline. I would never do that again. That neighbor was so eager to steal my chalk, so I shouted. Ugh. In case you are confused, I used to draw to our walls. So, I needed that chalk. I also used the chalk to calculate basic math, you know, kindergarten math. I was four or five I think. However, my mother was so loving, she gave me colored pens. Now, the walls had permanent inks.\n\nI think it is important to say that even though my mother is religious, she would not force me to do every religious thing, but she would teach me some things. Notedly, religion was not the forceful part, it was the tutoring. I remember in the second grade (late), one mistake in any subject on my exam would be equivalent to one tiny pinch that would make me bend my body. You know classic motherly disciplinary action from being stupid. Well, at least that's what my mom always says. I was intensely (at least for me) tutored by her from the day I got to hold a pencil. I remember answering simple geometry questions during my first grade. Of course, I was not anywhere near a genius, so I would get pinched again. My mother had so high expectations and was very eager to show people that I should be on top. I was never let to play if I was not yet done with her exams (and perfected them). With these actions, I always miss to play with my neighbors. Well, they were not the best people I know, but they were the only people in my town. So in conclusion, I never had any solid friends. And if I made one from my town, I always ended up destroying it because I was not the kind of person who would conform to their expectations. AND THEY HAD SILLY EXPECTATIONS. I mean, they>! tried kissing!< in front of me. They asked if I would like to join, OF COURSE NOT. I was maybe 8 at that time. It was a nightmare. At that time, I felt that I was never in my group and was constantly asking if I was right for my age. Neither of them thought the same way as me and I was comfortable being with adults because they were often quiet or discussing things that I was interested in or gentler to me.\n\nTo add, I was also very competitive. I think my mother's actions really influenced me. In every competition, even simply playing children's games, I really like to win. I think that also created some cracks with my childhood friends. Well, they were not really friendly too, so I just really decided that they were not worth my time. So, I never really tried hard to understand them, even though I tried to please them sometimes.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI just graduated with microbiology in my diploma. The whole course experience was actually just dreadful. I mean, I never liked it in the first place. I was contemplating to shift during my second year because it was boring for me. BUT, the friends I already had were very kind, and thinking I would leave them would not be a very excellent decision. Because I never liked any course except computer engineering which was not available at my university, shifting would just give me a new environment and would not fulfill the satisfaction I was looking for. So even though the course was not really for me, I somehow enjoyed laboratory activities, especially discovering some things I never thought I would see under a microscope. It's fascinating, but still, I was not happy. Graduating with flying colors would not eventually equal how much I liked the course, it would just mean that I was afraid of failing because I would be extended. I needed to get out the FASTEST way possible. I was not on a consistent dean's list and this was the ultimate decision maker of my grades because the time that I was out of the list, I would pursue getting on the list just to keep track. I remember two perfect exams I just made because I was angry about the low GWA (for me) I had last semester. I was so angry at that time because I let myself be filled with sadness I thought I just created myself. So I perfected the exams and got a 4.0 on that subject. And it's just because I was ANGRY at myself. Then it disappeared and I went back again to a stressed student who needed some help with her priorities.\n\n**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nThat would be refreshing for me, even though I think a week would be too long to stay at home. I would spend the week on vacation. I love my friends, but the topics they would share would most likely be their interests that would not really suit me. I am fine listening to them, but it's finer to have a vacation for myself. I really like experiencing things alone as I would learn some social things. I am very awkward, but I'm fine with a stranger. I would think that my friends would judge me so I mostly prefer to go or experience things alone. A stranger would not have existing information about you, so you're free to try and manipulate the set of impressions you can present to them. Well, just being nice would be enough. I just don't like overthinking things, even though I do it almost every time.\n\n**What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage?**\n\nI do prefer outdoor sports and some indoors. I play basketball and archery. I also like strategic games. I don't like sit-down games though they look interesting to me. I like watching chess, I just don't have the guts to learn it by the book. More like, I like watching people think. I always try to predict things and associate them with social and behavioral cues, crossing out things and adding new information. This was easier for me. This was how I learned basketball and some of the chess moves and techniques when I was younger without watching a video or reading a book. However, I forgot most of them now, mostly because I have no one to play with. \n\n**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI think I am moderately curious. Well, if I would compare my curiosity to my younger brother, I would fall low because who else would destroy a fully working machine just to see what's inside and use the important mechanical parts to build a boat?? Nah, not me. And yes, I would have many ideas and I would not execute them. And I do think many people had that too. Most of my ideas are conceptual and abstract, and I don't remember several of them now. May be if I come across related things or when I'm working on something. But I did remember one thing, mostly observed by my peers and I never had any experience as I would like to have. An example: \"When you have a crush on someone, you would likely appreciate the things that you wanted to have that you found in them. It's not just about liking them, it's about admiring the things you wish you had that is likely to be present in someone. That is why sometimes you mirror your crush's appearance and match them instead of actually talking to them.\" This statement usually describes a *preliminary admiration*, if that's even a term. Another is \"WE can be conditioned to something powerful. That is why I believe that a great environment creates geniuses in their field.\" This statement actually explains why the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer. And for the poor to get rich takes very few coincidences that would make them realize that they can. They are not getting a good environment and usually, people surrounding them would just do the same. That is why education can be an important factor for change (education in any form, even not going to school). \n\n**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI am not the kind of person that would volunteer as a leader. I would want some of the members to choose their own. If I would be chosen, I don't really bother. I became a leader a lot of times during my younger years and some currently, and I really like to set up a meeting where we would brainstorm on the suggestions we have and pick one of the most voted and another one for an extra in case the first choice would not work. And I also like to make them choose what part they want to work for. If they would not present themselves, I would plan some areas (equally) to which the whole project would contain and select people according to their talents (if I know some of them) or select at random if we're complete strangers to assign the parts. That would be time-bounded, including time for necessary corrections if there is. THESE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN OUTSIDE MY FRIENDS (CIRCLE). My friends are really procrastinators and it is always difficult for me to make them understand that I need a specific amount of time to polish the projects we have to work on and submitting their part during the day of the deadline would be my nightmare. I mean, I procrastinate too, but they are just GOD-TIER. My other friend doesn't actually care about passing late, so I often help her with some parts of the assignment. She was somehow depressed because of certain pressures in her life. We felt the same thing (as I did during college), but I just had more control over my decisions. She was breaking. So I often get stuck stretching my patience even though I am really about to burst. Well, that's a friend, so I have to respect her flaws and be there for her no matter what. But I would be lying if I said I would like to experience that again. \n\n**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nIn my normal self, yes. I like my hands. I love to write. I also do archery so I need to be fully aware of my arms. I am coordinated, I think. I also have good reflexes. I think my body's well. :) I also learn a lot with my body just by physically experiencing things and I usually do DIY because I don't really have enough money, just like I made my archery target board.\n\n**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI was not as artistic as my mother. I am not also as artistic as my friends but I do like art museums. I enjoy looking at them and predicting what they may mean. I really never met anyone in my life who has the same view of the world as me, at least in real life though. I am not also very talkative online so I would have many friends. My friends in real life are the only ones I talk to online, too. I have some online friends before but some are older than me and the conversation never really worked. They got really busy with their work irl and quit social media. So sad.\n\nI think I express my thoughts in writing. In high school, I often write poems. I also write letters to my friends just because I express myself truly and deeply through words.\n\n**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI remember the past, but I seldom dwell with them. Most of the time, they are traps that would impact your potential in the present. Well, of course, I still remember things, but I don't like it. I wonder more in the future. \"Where could I be in 10 years\" \"Am I going to be rich?\" Such childish nonsense, but I still do to escape in reality some of the time. I also believe that living in the present will determine the future. So, I do every time I'm in my normal self. Maybe this would be the cause why I survived college even though I don't like the degree itself.\n\n**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nYes, I would grant it. Sometimes I am busy, but I still give time to my friends if they need someone. Even though I always observe that I am not receiving the same thing back. I just wanted to be kind, for I know the world needs that. And they're my friends, I always want the best for them.\n\n**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nNeed, yes, but I'm not always using it. I am sometimes impulsive and I hate that part of me. But even though that exists, impulsiveness created some 'fun' in my life. I was a rule follower during my childhood and it's fun to take some risks sometimes. But I am mostly logical throughout my life and check my existing values every time I am getting a difficult moral situation. I also would like to mention my ability to check logical fallacies. I am good at detecting those things which would really help me judge people's behaviors that are not just making sense. This comes like a superpower in some situations, where I can correctly guess that someone's pretending or lying even if we just first met. The statements they are just saying would not make sense. I don't know, other people (friends, family) do not go into this detail when they first meet with somebody.\n\n**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nVery, especially during schoolwork or group work. The thing is, I noticed that many of my classmates actually do not respect the concept of time. And when there would be a group meeting, most of them would be talking about other things and not about the work that must be done. I mean, I usually procrastinate myself, but that's just because I have a good knowledge of my abilities and some of the work may be finished within hours before the deadline, especially essays that I could just sit for 2 hours maximum. The thing with group projects is that they would be huge and have plenty of activities that the group should divide among the members. And I have very little patience with those people who would actually choose to do other things than what is planned. My friends are often like that, and I don't like it. I am not a meticulous person, but I can be if needed. I am not the most productive of the group, but I can produce results. Some just can't, and really, I hate it. I don't know, it's just one of my pet peeves. I mean, it's okay to deliver imperfect work, just tell me what part are you having difficulty with or why you decided to delay things.  I always give consideration. Just, you know when someone's just throwing their part and then they just let you finish it. \n\n**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don't like to control others just because I know it is not ethical, at least on my set values. But I admit, I have the tendency to do so. There were many instances, several of them were from my younger years. Those were BAD, because I was a control freak and I never liked anyone that's opposing me. Now, there are still remnants of it, especially the patience I have for somebody, but I have undergone some character development. I learned to be humble and actually treat people as people. Coming from me, this is a very huge jump. I think I learned some of these things because of my friends, the same friends I mentioned earlier. Those people have HIGH EQs, at least compared to me. That is why I still remain friends with them because they accept me for who I am, even though I am sometimes a pain. Well, I have the same sentiments as them, too :).\n\n **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\n1. Writing - I write to keep my mental health stable. I also don't like to express all my true feelings to my friends, so I write. \n2. Basketball/Archery - This makes me think that I'm really worthy of an opponent, even though I am not the best at these events. I pursue them because they are entertaining and would usually serve as my escape route from studying pressures and some personal problems.\n3. Jigsaw puzzles (I just remembered)- The only hobby that keeps me sitting (with some stretches) for 5-7 hours straight. You know what, I reckon, maybe I can learn chess? Well, it's just as entertaining as it looks! \n4. Watching movies - I like watching romantic movies when I'm stressed, horror movies when I am feeling happy, action movies when I have free time, and sad movies so that I can feel that I have a reason to cry several times a year.\n\nI'm sure I still have more, I just don't remember as of the moment.\n\n**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI learn best when I'm experiencing it myself. Often in sports, I just don't rely on the instructions, I have to practice it myself, though I admit knowledge does come from reading first (principles). I often struggle with PowerPoint presentation that just contains texts of their own so I often record the class or write down notes the way my teacher explain things and what conclusions I can draw from their statements. I think this was how I survived college. \n\nI dislike memorization for I don't really learn much from it. I like concept reading where I can answer and analyze many situations relevant to the concept. I also use logic to answer them, that's how scientific essays usually work in exams. \n\n**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI don't usually intensely strategize except when I need to manage my time. Because I didn't have an organization that I would lead in college, I was usually free and was able to manage projects without thorough planning. So my plans would usually just live in my head and the default process of tasks is that I would complete the easiest ones and focus on bigger parts later. Even though this would appear slightly spontaneous, I usually don't like improvising. Especially if the time was given before completing a project. Even though I usually don't have thorough plans, I can maintain in achieving a particular goal that I can work on until it's complete.\n\n**What's important to you and why?**\n\nMy family, close friends, and books even though I'm not a bookworm. It's not a hobby, but whenever I'm tired or restless, opening a good book is really like drinking a delicious tea in the morning. \n\nFamily, friends, they're the ones that supported me and were there for me since the beginning. Without them, I think I would not appreciate the world and the happiness it can offer.\n\n**What are your aspirations?**\n\nI really wanted to be a person who could deliver her duty to someone and would make them happy or satisfied. That's why, instead of taking and re-enrolling myself in computer engineering, I wanted to be a doctor. At the current age, I can learn programming if I want to, given the online resources that are accessible, even though I know it would be harder than enrolling myself again. I also wanted to give back to the community and just help other people by performing my best in my job. I want to directly affect them, just like in healthcare. Medicine just fascinates me and being able to actually study for something that I love and that directly affects people would be enough routine in my life. It also involves research which is something I liked when I was in college, though the process going through is not really that likeable. But the feeling after completing it is just a chef's kiss, especially if you see the hard work you did paid off.\n\n**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI am not usually scared of anything, except big spiders and the ocean itself. I even made a vow to myself that I would not travel on a ship. I panic when I cannot touch the sand with my foot. I even panic seeing rocks under me, so yes.\n\nI am uncomfortable being ignored (with friends; I'm numb with my family), when people cut me off when I'm talking, jogging with normal people in the morning (I usually like to be with someone), some intense criticism (from friends and family: would really hurt me), and performing drama (I hate this). These things would make me uncomfortable because they either hurt me or just make me think little of myself. Strangers don't usually affect me as much as the people who I'm close with.\n\n**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nYou will know that I'm in my nice zone if I am considerate, understanding, smiling with no reason (maybe I'm not just aware), and just talkative which is so not me in my normal days. I am so nice which I don't even understand. Also, I can just be sitting reading all day. When I'm focused, I am usually like that. I also don't mind the noise in my environment, I'm just practically calm. I also do not overthink things and let everything go with the flow. \n\n**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI would be angry at all times and be sarcastic to all the people I talk with. I would be honest with what I think and just basically *turn off* my emotions. I also become ruthless, especially when I think someone is not giving me the things that I deserve. I also become a perfectionist and overthink things a lot. I shout at people when they are annoying me and I would hate anything that's unclean and say every little thing I noticed that would not be up to my standard. I would criticize a lot of things and why they exist (not people). I would also become annoyed with everyone not in particular and would act like a smartass to anyone and in my head call them idiots. No kidding, in my lows, I act like a queen (that's angry all the time), even though I am not. And this is contrary to my lowest. \n\nAt my lowest, I would isolate myself for days without contact. I even would deactivate my social media accounts. I just don't feel like talking to anyone. And after days, I would be okay and back to normal. That's where I would share some of my problems (not deep reasons) with my friends and what I felt. You would not appreciate confronting me before I isolate because I would be angry at you for invading my privacy, even though we are close. And my friends understand these things. They are such very lovely people.\n\n**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI think I am very realistic. I do daydream just to escape temporarily from all the stress I just did to myself, but I can easily go back and finish the task I'm working on. When I daydream, I just stare because I can forget where I am, maybe my mind is trying to keep me at rest. I could also be lost in some music, but I would not be aware of my surroundings if that's the case. \n\n**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI would be thinking why I would be there. I mean, who would put me in that room. To be honest, I would try to escape. But if it's something I choose myself to ponder things, I would be thinking about the future. I would really like to talk to my future self if I am following the right path in the present or if I need to switch to another track. I was always not very sure about the path I chose but I am able to hold it firm until someone or something can make me realize that I am wrong. It never happened. That is why I like to talk to my future self if she could reassure me because I am not confident with the decisions I have made and will be making in the future. \n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt would take me days or even weeks to decide, especially if it's a very significant turning point in my life. I also would have done basic research on its consequences if it's possible. I also would ask my friends about it, even though they would not likely help me because our interests would not really align. And when I make my decision, I don't usually change it. It would be very hard at that point to change sides.\n\n**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nJust like when I'm making my decisions, I process my emotions hours to days before I respond to things. I am not very self-aware unlike my friends so I would need constant help checking myself. Emotions are just as important as any other part of me. They are the reflection of my subconsciousness. Something that I'm not aware of, but I'm fully capable of feeling. That is why in some situations, when usually I can't gather enough logical explanations, I would just trust my gut and decide with it. That's why I'm impulsive sometimes. \n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nIn some situations, yes. But NO to most people who would exist in my life consistently even if they were not so close to me. I would try to deliver my point of view. I am not very rash and aggressive in these situations, but I would not lie about my point of view. I would try to gather their views and explain to them why I think the opposite and try to make them understand me, too. And if they refuse to understand, like they would fight to dominate, I would not be elaborating because I know I could just waste my time and I don't like to be involved in conflicts I never aimed to join. There are some situations in which I could say yes because I know I would not meet that person again so setting the impression to them would not be very important. I would try to get out of the conversation with these types of people as easily as I can.\n\n**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nNo. I don't break rules but I think skepticism/criticism towards authority can still be done. And they never know better. I don't also know better. It's just a matter of values. If I think the authority would be abusing their power, I would not hesitate to give them a piece of my mind, especially when it affects the people I protect. However, when it happens to me and it's not affecting anyone else, I can be patient and ignore their shortcomings. I also think that I am capable of breaking the rules but I am just avoiding unnecessary conflict in my life.\n\n**What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nMy ideal life would be a life in which I would not seek approval from other people and those people would not be very judgemental of me. I mean, a peaceful life where people would just be kind and gentler would be enough. I have no materialistic standard for this, just peace overall.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI think these things would be all. I know this would not be enough to know my whole life, but at least I know it summarizes good points of my behaviors and overall experiences with the help of the guide questions. >!I often was identified as INFJ, which I don't relate much.

{"submission": "Everytime I go online and ask for my type with me including some long tangent in depth of my cognitive functions. People describe me as ENFP. But I am so shy In real life and it doesn't convey properly in my text because Im not very in depth or anything. I am extremely socially anxious around people, but I hate being by myself. Yet I find that even though I dislike being by myself, being alone is what I do pretty much 24/7 Im always on my computer to 5 am or whatever on any game or doing something to get dopamine whether thats learning or messing around on a video game. Sometimes I just freak out and think all my friends hate me so then I go online and befreind like 500 people enjoy that dopamine and then never speak to them ever again. \n\nWith people, I can be super energetic but usually with most, I am worried I'll come off as weird and that they'll hate me. I'm also worried that I'll attach to tehm, because I tend to attach to anyone nice to me and obsess over them. I'm 90% sure I have ne, even though I lack imagination, I think I have ideas? just that I'm so scared to talk about them because I feel like I'm dumb.  I have fi, used to be stuck with that because I dont know who I am but I am always just wearing what I want and may have messy hair and I also never wear makeup and stuff I never conform to anyone. But at the same time I always worry when people are being excluded. But also I'm terrible at comforting people. I have si but I hate thinking about my past ,its just triggering but I am the first to notice when the surroundings of an area are different to how they were in the past. I thought I had se like I used to skateboard and parkour but now I just dont notice the present at all, but I'm not in imagination either, I'm just too busy having anxiety to think properly at all. Idk if I worry about 12 diff things or only one thing but Ik that I am not in the present, I dissociate quite a lot. The present just reminds me of the past now. But sometimes I can be very energetic and stuff and I run on adrenaline rushes sometimes. But I also have severe sensory overload. Its not like I think about the future either though... I really dont know. If it helps I also have autism, adhd and ocd.   Ti I score very high on pretty much every test cuz I love accuracy and I learn for the sake of learning a lot. Idk if I have ne because I have no idea how to read between the lines, I tend to overthink bodylanguage and get stuck on things. But Im also very open minded and can see how any idea can be good. Like if someone says that a method is bad I can be like \"but what if it isn't because...\"  so idk. I also did roleplay a lot. I'm pretty much never me, I'm just always feeling like a fictional character so maybe that counts as being in imagination I'm not too sure but thats all I do to cope with reality so... But I also dislike reading...\n\nThese are my most recent results. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs8fc1lgf2mb1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4c541c6268eb001b4c6fa3dc00d4183eb7b5266\n\nhonestly don't think I think outside of the box. I dont think I'm even near it. I dont know if I even come up with more than 1 idea. I dont notice any of this stuff no matter how much I try to notice it, i cant.

{"submission": " \n\n I paid money to be typed but recently I have had many reasons to believe I was mistyped, so I'm giving my typing another go.  \n\n\nFeedback appreciated, I'm fucking tired of flip flopping between types \ud83e\udd27  \n\n\n**What do you study or do for a living? How did you come to do that? What do you like or dislike about it?**  \nI'm currently studding psychology and ding freelance translations. I've been into psychology since I was a teen so I bit the bullet and decided to try it on professionally after realizing that if it kept my interest so far is because it definitely has a lot of meaning to me.My mom has been hinting ta it for years too, telling me I have a knack for it and I think she's right.\n\n  \n**What else do you do on a daily basis? What are your interests and hobbies? Why do you do them?**  \nI have avery chill routine, wake up and make my mom breakfast before she goes to work, then start on the laundry and have my own breakfast reading the news on my interest fields, start my translations, stop for lunch and watching some Youtube or TikToks, work some more, make dinner and have it while watching some Netlix or something, then study. I love music (I'm specially into Kpop), typology, fashion, cooking and baking competition shows, learning about new cultures,, photography and videography, color theory. I do them because obviously they fascinate me, make me curious and give me pleasure.\n\n  \n**What are your values, and why?**  \nWhat does 'value' mean here? Just what I like or morals? This is super vague but I'll bite: I value truth, I'll take it at any cost, better an ugly truth than a beautiful lie, ignorance isn't bliss is decadence. I value freedom, nothing else has nay meaning or value without it. I value beauty, not just visual but anything that makes you elevated, like you just experienced something that proves the existence of God. I value wisdom, we were given mental abilities so e can learn and knowledge is power, but true knowledge is understanding, not just information. I value honor, be someone worthy of respect, don't do lowly things.  \n\n\n**Describe your relationships with family and friends. What do you like and dislike about them?**  \nI dislike super self centered people to the point where they become a nuisance to others, people who make empty promises, who are hypocrites and apply double standards, who never take responsibility or recognize mistakes, who love to talk badly about others or just won't shut up about other people's lives when I couldn't give a shit, who lie compulsively just to get attention etc.  \n**What do you look for in friends? In romantic relationships?**  \nGood character, honest, personality that is pleasant and interesting to me, give me attention and respect me and my boundaries.  \n**What conflicts have you encountered recently with other people? Why did they happen? Which kinds seem to happen on a regular basis?**  \nPeople who can't decide even simple things like what movie we're gonna watch for themselves, who make careless choices than want to change it at the last second inconveniencing me because they didn't really know hat they were picking in the first place. People who can't communicate clearly and directly about what they want and expect me to guess what they would like hen they don't even know it themselves.  \n**What are your strengths? What do people like about you? What do you like about yourself?**  \nI'm pretty smart and shrewd, it's extremely hard for something to get past me and fool me or catch me off guard without me clocking it miles ahead. I'm very direct and won't sugarcoat things thought in the recent years I have learned to deliver with more tact and care. I'm pragmatic in that I'm realistic and will always call a spade a spade and recognize that what I want and what is possible or more advantageous are many time very different things. I'm very ethical and take a hard line approach when it comes to the principles I believe are nonnegotiable.  \n**What are your weaknesses? What criticism do you often face from others? What do you dislike about yourself?**  \nI'm very inconsistent in my efforts when it comes to taking care of the house or my well being, I can't sustain a diet, exercise routine or house chores productivity schedule for long. I get distracted very easily by things that seem interesting and waste a lot of time jumping from video to video or article to article, my mind is very restless and needs fun most of the time. I used to be too cutting with people and I still am very impatient which at times makes me rude. I have a need to be good at things from the start that has stopped me from even trying some things or putting myself out there with others.  \n\n\n**In what areas of life can you manage well on your own? In what areas of your life would you like help?**  \nI'm good with budgeting, scheduling things, keeping tabs on resources but wish I didn't have to cook and clean everyday.  \n**What things do you dislike doing? What things do you enjoy more than others?**  \nAs already mentioned I dislike house chores and anything that demands waiting, also hen people ask me do to things for them they definitely can and should be doing themselves. I love studying my areas of interest through reading or watching content, analyzing people using typology is also a big hobby of mine.  \n**What goals, aspirations, or plans do you have for the future, and why?**  \nI wanna be healthy and happy, feel in peace with myself. Would love to have much more money and a much more full social life. Being proud of yourself is essential for complete self esteem and I wanna make my dreams reality.  \n**What kinds of things do you do to manage and/or beautify your environment (your room, your house, etc.)?**  \nBesides cleaning not much since I live with my mom so it's not my space so to speak. I do buy a bunch o cute gadgets and kitchen accessories though, they make working more pleasurable My room though I love decorating and ill alter it every new season (I love following a theme like 'all' or \"Christmas').  \n\n\n**If you won the lottery and didn't have to work anymore, what would you do?**Study music and photography, travel constantly, spend a lot on aesthetics.  \n\n\n**What traits do you find endearing that others might dislike? What traits are considered positive/neutral by others but tend to annoy you?**  \nI think shyness is often cute, and I detest conceited people, cockiness is a huge turnoff to me.  \n\n\n**How do you behave around strangers?**  \nThat totally depends on several factors: How are they treating me and others? Are there red flags? Are they boring?  \n**How do you react to conflict? What do you do if somebody insults or attacks you?**  \nI'm very assertive and pretty aggressive by nature so don't expect me to diffuse, I have zero tolerance for passive aggressiveness or childish pettiness. I wanna clear things up ASAP. When insulted if it matters i'll hit them thrice as hard, but if it's something or someone stupid I'll just ignore to piss them off more.  \n\n\n**Would you ever be interested in starting a business? Why or why not? What role would you play in it? What kind of business would it be?**  \nNo I'm not interested in that at all, don't see the appeal,not enough time or focus on me.  \n**How do you dress or manage your appearance?**  \nI'm very into studying body typing systems, personal essence and color analysis, so I care about working with hat I have and enhancing my strongest points. As Epictetus said \"Know first who you are and then adorn yourself accordingly\".  \n**Do you like kids? Why or why not?**  \nNo they usually are disrespectful**,** crude, stupid or really annoying.  \n\n\n**In what situations or times in your life did you feel most fulfilled, and why?**  \nWhen I'm doing something really well specially if there's an audience or when I'm just completely carefree enjoying myself.\n\n  \n**How do you feel about attention? Do you seek it out?**  \nLove it but don't seek it out most of the time, I think is cringe and embarrassing. Besides it only fees my vanity if it's natural.\n\n  \n**Your friend bursts into tears. What do you do? How does it make you feel?**  \nI panic, I have no idea how to console a person as I hate platitudes. I just get a glass of water or hand them a handkerchief, my nature is to offer solutions.\n\n  \n**What is something you regret?**Saying no to many opportunities because I didn't think myself capable and was terrified of failing.  \n\n\n**What are your spiritual or religious beliefs and why do you hold them?**  \nReligion is a tool for control and self delusion, I am spiritual instead.I believe in many things because they are proven or at lest heavily supported by my on experiences, those of other people and because they explain common phenomena.  \n**What kind of work environment do you prefer? What do you look for in a job?**  \nCompetent leadership, clear goals and expectations, defined roles, mutual respect, good resources for workers.  \n**What is or was your favorite school subject and why?**  \nEnglish (not my native language), I was great at that, it came naturally.  \n**What is one common misconception that people have about life? Explain why it is wrong.**  \nThat is complicated, it's not, people just don't wanna accept reality or use their minds.  \n\n\n**What do you do if you're not getting what you want? What approach do you use?**  \nIt totally depends on the situation, but usually I retreat and research, talk to other people, just gather more info or just wait. Timing is everything and sometimes is just not the right moment. Of course that if it's something I need done with urgency I'll compromise and get the next best thing, I'm pragmatic.  \n\n\n**Are you comfortable taking leadership roles? In what areas? Why or why not?**I was a pretty bossy child, then ran from leadership for my years since at school it meant picking everyone's slack and most were both lazy and incompetent, then realized things are better when I run a tight ship. If you want something well done than do it yourself and all.  \n\n\n**How often do you get angry? What kinds of things make you angry?**  \nI get irritated by many things I already mentioned previously often, but angry very seldom.I used to be angry a lot but a few years back I realized it made life heavier so I just started to let go and detached form many things that indeed were irrelevant and inconsequential.  \n**What is your sense of humor like? Do you joke around a lot?**  \nI'm either witty/sarcastic or pretty silly depending on the day, I joke around unless I'm stressed but I'm far from a class clown.  \n**What were you like as a child? How have you changed since then?**  \nSuper curious, asked many questions, a physical explorer, athletic and loved to perform in public and was very perfectionist about it, very active imagination that was triggered by my surroundings (nature), very social, loud and a bit bossy, talked a lot very fast, didn't know how to walk just run, polite and generally obedient, very attached to my dolls and characters in cartoons, very willful and would freely demonstrate displeasure, really worried about being 'bad', kinda Hermione Granger-like (wanted to be the best or at lest great at school and pressured myself to meet standards) emotions that oscillated between being intensely felt or a detachment from them as if it s happening to someone else, sometimes felt deep melancholy and loneliness (as bullied on and off for many years) that wouldn't express but were mirrored by certain songs lyrics. After 7 years of bullying I became very insecure, closed off, anxious and limbic for years. As an adult still working on healing I'm reserved, way less active, hate melancholy. Apart from that, I'm still the same: a weird mixture of hedonistic info junkie and controlling competence focus.

{"submission": "**My Traits (From most negative to most positive)**\n\n* At my worst, I am completely overwhelmed by worry and getting stuck in past experiences because what if I have ruined my life beyond repair and have NOT realized it until 3 years later? I can also become overly worried about painful diseases out of nowhere such as rabies.\n* I sometimes feel the need to repress my thoughts and feelings because if I get exposed, it feels like I have to explain all of my thoughts, especially the toxic ones, one by one, expect doomful judgment, and possibly grounding. And the thing is that, trying to repress actually generates even more anxiety, until I can\u2019t hide it anymore and I feel guilty for my own negative thoughts.\n* I can be rather lazy at times because I can be preoccupied with my identity and excessive amount of self-discovery. (Currently 19 years old, Male BTW)\n* I am rather fussy and easily annoyed by things, such as small details in environment (though they can be funny), and anything harmful to my health, such as secondhand smoke.\n* I tend to envy people who are: Having little to no worries, not obsessed about minor annoyances, able to act quickly without overthinking, automatically satisfied without much work, able to solve practical problems, able to handle stress calmly, trailblazing and acting without worrying about consequences, able to be carefree at all times, and able to be good at everything with little effort (though this can be me, more accurately, people who naturally act on their potential)\n* As for the types I envy the most, they are: ExxPs (especially Ne doms), ExFJs, Enneagram 7, Enneagram 3, Tritypes 137, 278, 279, 378, 379, 478, 479, Sanguine temperament, High IQ\n* I get angry when I feel like I am controlled unfairly for no reason, especially with mundane stuff. It doesn\u2019t become rage, but I feel the need to confront sometimes.\n* I make mental associations and find similar characters, objects, concepts, and many others in order to better understand myself and feel better as well. For example, my personality is similar to this YouTuber, this animal, this PC component, etc.\n* I have highly detailed memories and people appreciate me for that. Sometimes, I enjoy reliving my memories, and make associations with music, concepts, and gain inspiration.\n* Having a sense of purpose and efficiency is important but I end up learning a bunch of things just for the sake of it without practical purpose. I guess learning itself is just fun and efficiency comes after all that.\n* While I cared about being a good person, it wasn\u2019t perfect and I had a lot of wild moments. I would stress test devices out of sheer curiosity, take apart stuff, go to obscure places, etc.\n* I can adapt to a wide range of learning styles, such as visualizing it, relating it to other topics, interactive learning, etc. What I don\u2019t like is boring memorization with no real value (as ChatGPT is a thing), too much repetition, and most importantly, intolerance to innovation. It\u2019s super infuriating when you must use pencil and paper when you can use an iPad Pro.\n* As for the assignments, I am fine with unclear assignments when there can be loads of interesting ideas and creativity is valued. But if the professor is giving an unclear assignment with only one right way, it\u2019s like you are throwing darts until you find the right way. Or you don\u2019t. I also don\u2019t like overly strict assignments and mountains of boring homework.\n* For me, knowing the consequences are very important, though I sometimes fail to see consequences, it is still important for me because if I do something without knowing the consequences and I realize them way too late, it feels like unavoidable doom is coming. \n* I make a point in being honest and frank with my things. If I become too dishonest and secretive, I feel like a bad person at first and eventually, unavoidable disaster will derail me.\n* My relation with rules: Too many useless rules will annoy me. Of course, I would follow the laws by proper authorities, especially if they are fair, and also due to the fear of being trapped in dire consequences. When I\u2019m breaking them, it\u2019s usually because of forgetting them, or assuming it isn\u2019t there. With social etiquette, I am far more rebellious. And with the stupid rules made by regular people just to hold others back, I secretly rebel a lot of the times. I am never directly arguing unless I am caught and the rule is REAL stupid.\n* When I see a mistake, I am quick to point it out and fix them. I even used to march into the cashier\u2019s desk in order to learn all the details about that computer, and change the screen resolution so everything becomes clearer. Of course, I would do it in a good and casual way.\n* While I have a good amount of my favorites, I enjoy trying out new things in order to challenge myself and make the experience more meaningful. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t return to familiar stuff.\n* I don\u2019t work steadily, but rather, when I want to. It\u2019s like I do what I feel like I want to do at the moment rather than complying with a strict schedule.\n* I was individualistic throughout my life, and enjoyed working alone way more than in teams, because when I work alone, I have more freedom and control over the project, and I used to be quite shy when I was a child.\n* I care a lot about getting along well with people and understanding them. But I sometimes fail to do that and maybe say something \u201csharp\u201d on accident, or forget to take care of my hair.\n* I often do something new and exciting in order to challenge myself, learn new things, and maybe let that mental chatter go away. When I am not learning, I feel stuck and just surviving.\n* It\u2019s very important for me to make the ideal decision, which it makes me slow to make decisions at times. I need the ideal experience rather than many subpar experiences.\n* I am often capable of doing truly spontaneous stuff when I\u2019m feeling great such as starting a new language, doing a new type of workout, and create content, all on the same day.\n* I am intellectually curious and I love learning new things. A day without learning is wasted life.\n* I feel better when I am able to solve an intellectual problem or a challenge. They make me feel motivated and make me push forward.\n* I would really like to interact with the world around me and try them out. I used to hate boring lectures where you take notes by just writing what the teacher says and there\u2019s no meaningful learning involved there.\n* I am considered as sociable and enthusiastic, and I can talk about a great deal of topics, either picking up new things from my environment or my own fun knowledge. It can create funny moments and light-hearted enjoyment.\n\nI\u2019m kinda tired so that\u2019s all for now.

{"submission": "* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm a 27-year-old woman. I would describe myself as reserved, task-oriented, and respectful of others. I get stressed easily, but I'm also very calm and laid-back. I'm a good listener and I really enjoy playful banter. If I'm being totally honest, I'm not the most exciting person out there. I'm not excitable or outgoing, and I'm not much of a risk-taker. I'm ok with that, though.\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was pretty standard. I'm an only child and I have older parents who are pretty religious. I shared their beliefs until I was in high school, at which point I started going in more of a spiritual direction.\n\n* **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI work in manufacturing and I really love it, although I don't want to do it forever. This is the first job I've had that isn't related to customer service, and it's a nice change. I really enjoy setting goals for myself and slowly rising to the top. Since I'm training to go into a type of management, I'm also being mentored and learning a \\*lot\\* about leading a team, and that experience has kinda turned my life around (for the better).\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI'd feel refreshed. When I'm going through a lot of stress or dealing with negative emotions, I isolate myself as much as possible for a few days/weeks/however long I need, and just reflect and keep myself entertained with books, shows, music, and games. It might not be the healthiest way of dealing with stress, but I can definitely think of worse ways. Plus, it got me out of a bad slump earlier this year.\n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?**\n\nI'm definitely not a sports person, but I do enjoy fitness and being active. I especially like weight-lifting and going on nature walks.\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nAbsolutely. I have a lot that I could improve on, but I sometimes train people at work and I think I'm becoming a pretty good leader. My leadership style is helpful and motivational. I really enjoy giving encouragement and positive feedback. However, my communication style when training or giving direction is very straightforward, and I sometimes worry about coming off as irritated or intimidating to more timid types of people (especially because I used to be very timid and unsure of myself).\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI think it's important to learn from the past, make the most of the present, and plan for the future. The one I struggle with most is the future. There are so many uncertainties in life that I sometimes see careful planning as a waste of time, even though I know it's important.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nOf course I'm more inclined to help with annoying or stressful tasks if the person asking is someone I'm close with, but generally speaking, I help others when asked as long as the request isn't a huge inconvenience (ie. I'm only waking up at 5am for a small handful of people). I don't really think about why I help others; I guess if I can make someone's life a little bit easier, why not do it?\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes. If my beliefs, values, or decisions are inconsistent or incompatible with each other, I feel the need to reevaluate them. I'm actually going through something like this right now: I have some spiritual and \"new age\" beliefs but I've also recently adopted the philosophy of existentialism. I'm not sure if these beliefs conflict with each other (due to contrasting ideas about cosmic justice) or if they are compatible (both are partly based on the idea that we each control our own destiny).\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nExtremely important. I take a lot of pride in my efficiency and productivity.\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI play video games, especially open-world RPGs and roguelikes. I like immersing myself in the world of whatever game I'm playing, and I also think it's fun to play around with different builds and weapons. I also spend a lot of time listening to music, like limiting distractions and just getting lost in the beat or the lyrics. I'm not sure why I like to do this, but I always feel better after listening to a really good album.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI learn best with a combination of hands-on experience and hearing (lectures, discussions, videos, etc). I struggle with learning environments that depend heavily on independent reading. For example, reading a chapter in a textbook is alright, but I benefit more from a break-down of key points and practical examples.\n\n* **What's important to you and why?**\n\nPersonal growth is important to me. I want to be constantly learning and evolving. If I'm not growing, I just feel like I'm in a slump, or aimlessly wandering through life. Deep emotional connections are also important to me. I'm not a very social person, but relationships in which I can be vulnerable are actually priceless.\n\n* **What are your aspirations?**\n\nI want to continue building my career and become an HR manager. In general, I would really like to be in a position where I can inspire others one day.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nOne of my fears is losing the deep personal connections I have with a small group of people. I generally try not to care about what other people think, but there are exceptions, and sometimes I literally have nightmares about certain people getting mad at me. Excessive affection, especially romantic affection, makes me uncomfortable. I'm open to having relationships, but I just *can't* handle the grand gestures and overly sentimental stuff. It just seems so forced and, on a certain level, insulting. I hate when people either lack self-awareness or just have no regard for other people. I am *especially* irked by people who think it's ok to treat others poorly just because they're in a bad mood. Don't get me wrong, I occasionally get snappy when I'm stressed, but I just mean straight-up giving everyone dirty looks, ignoring people, etc.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nDuring the \"highs\" in my life, I have a healthy support system and am working toward something. I'm at a \"high\" right now.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe \"lows\" in my life can get pretty dark. I lose motivation to the point where I don't follow up with basic chores or hygiene. I gravitate toward toxic and manipulative people. This usually happens when I feel like I don't have any direction in life. I was at a \"low\" for a little over half a decade and I'm determined to never go back.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt depends on the decision, but it usually doesn't take me very long to decide on important things. I think about my options until something just \"clicks\" and I know what I want to do. I can't think of an example, but I think I would definitely at least be open to changing my mind if I had new information or thought about factors that I hadn't considered before.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me a while. I tend to go emotionally \"numb\" when a highly emotional event happens, whether it's good or bad. I don't feel anything for a few hours or days, and then the feelings slowly sink in.\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNot usually, but I will try to find common ground or even just nod and say, \"I see where you're coming from,\" if I don't think a deeper discussion will be productive. \n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI do not break rules often or really ever. I have mixed feelings about authority; it's something I value, but I also think it's important for authority figures to be open to feedback and earn respect instead of just expecting it.\n\n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nI haven't figured that out yet.", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": "ISTJ", "logprobs": {"IST": [{"token": "IST", "logprob": -0.38777596}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.531199}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -2.973353}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -3.542933}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -4.5406823}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -4.681805}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.3416467}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -7.329781}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -7.343348}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -7.924887}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -7.93455}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -8.239636}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.362302}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -8.489636}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.987323}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.468505}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -9.7642565}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -9.9345255}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.072696}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -10.411738}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.00022833108}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -8.401921}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.306066}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -14.318955}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -14.330358}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.370397}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.328977}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -15.551206}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.5881605}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -16.196234}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -16.20738}, {"token": "M", "logprob": -16.487057}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -16.699806}, {"token": "K", "logprob": -16.744076}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -16.789612}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -16.848316}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.921406}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -17.206062}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -17.211899}, {"token": "E", "logprob": -17.296654}]}}

{"submission": "This is probably going to be a little messy, but here are a list of traits that I have noticed in myself.\n\nI think what people often note about me is that I am very laidback and agreeable on the surface, but also very intense underneath. Should note that this agreeableness is not really the people pleasing \"oh I am happy with whatever you are happy with!\" kind of behaviour, moreso adaptable and willing to try other things, so more of a \"oh, that sounds like a good idea, I'll hop on that train too\" kind of tone. However, I do have my own agendas and beliefs of what is right and wrong, so I can seem flexible UNTIL something crosses those personal values and then I become stubborn and tenacious. Another way it can show up is I can seem like I am just adapting to the situation, but in reality I am leveraging the circumstances for my own ends, and people don't realize that/couldn't see it until afterwards when they step back for the bigger picture.\n\nI realized the other day that my best and worst trait all have to do with the same problem I have: I am very terrible at prioritizing. Everything seems important to me. As such, at best, I tend to be great strategist or tactician, plotting out a plan that takes care of EVERYTHING, every angle, every person, every detail. All planned out so we do not have to make any sacrifices. At my worst, I procrastinate or become a complete multi-tasking mess because I simply cannot decide on what to do first, thus end up in a deadlock or trying to do too many things at once.\n\nI think I find the idea that \"the world is just the way it is\" very offensive. I am obsessed over the idea of transformation, alchemy, and shapeshifting. I love the idea of getting to control how things are to your very whims. To be able to shape the world and yourself to your heart's content is something that I have fantasies about. However, this does mean that I get frustrated implicitly when people tell me things just have to be a certain way.\n\nI am generally a man of action. When I can have a clear goal, either because I finally got around to prioritizing properly or because the situation did it for me through emergency or a very angry boss, then I can be very decisive with my actions and I am not afraid of tiredness or frustration. What matters is that I am working and I am in the right direction. My mother noted once that she found me happiest when I was busy yet not chaotic, and I am inclined to agree.\n\nI am a little self-absorbed, admittedly. My thought processes are often all about my own introspections, projects, and developments. The going-ons of the world is off secondary concern. This often means I can be having a good day because my projects are on the right track, only to suddenly realize I forgot to check in with family and friends for a few weeks. Or I may be making progress with self-development, but totally forget to read the news to get the latest on world events. There is often a sense of \"what does this have to do with me\" that I instinctively feel about news, and so I often have to reason myself into caring about the world. (everything impacts finance, could be good socializing topic, etc.)\n\nI definitely like sciences more than humanities and commerce. I like things that are definitely true and logical. People don't always compute for me, even if I do my best to be polite and empathetic. I think that's more so my own fault for being too task-oriented sometimes. Not that I come across as blunt or cold, mind you. I have gotten good at memorizing what you're supposed to do in certain social situations. (e.g. just quietly practice active listening if you notice someone here to vent rather than wanting to solve problems.) BUT this is still memorization of \"correct answer\". I don't fundamentally understand the need to vent, if I'm fully honest. I think I just treat socialization as a fun puzzle, both in the sense of \"can I handle this situation gracefully\" and \"can I figure out how their mind works\". I love trying to probe what people's central motives and values are. It's fascinating how even very close people can have wildly different answers.\n\nThat being said, for work, I would much rather be working on something more logical. For example, if I, a programmer, ever get the chance to get a promotion, I most likely would go for architect and then CTO route rather than manager and then CEO route. I need my work to be mostly logical and technologically based. That is where I find fun but also where I find comfort.\n\nI can often daydream when I am not actively doing anything. Usually this is daydreaming some kind of action film scene that could happen in this situation I am in, (e.g. if I am in a bus, what if it flips, how would I react that would look cool yet be practical) or it might be based on a piece of fiction that I know of, also action genre. (e.g. daydreaming about what mask I would use if I was in the world of Hotline Miami)\n\nI don't know if I am really extroverted or introverted, socially speaking. I can deal with people okay, and I know how to initiate conversations, but I don't know if I really get drained or energized by it. I will say that I absolutely love hanging out with a small group, especially one-on-one time. That's because this is the time when all the secrets and truth comes out. People admit to their insecurities, dreams, passion in ways that they could never dream to say in places with a lot of other people. I like that truthfulness. Hanging out with a lot of people is irritating because now everyone is playing the social game and everything feels so......fake. I can stand being alone, but being with a small group is ideal. So I guess my preference goes small group > alone > large group. (to me small group is 3 and under. More than that and people start to play social games in my experience)\n\nI noticed in a conversation with some of my friends that I tend to be more cynical of other people's intentions than most people. I seem to default to thinking that everyone necessarily only care about their own priorities and plans, and you only value to them IF it fits their agenda. If you're now thinking \"this guy is projecting real bad\" then you'd be right. That's the conclusion I came to as well. However, this does mean that altruism or even just caring for the sake of caring doesn't exist in my worldview. Great example of this was in college one time a few of our friends were hanging out together and I had to leave early after having downed a few beers. One of my friends turned to me with a very genuinely concerned face and asked if I was okay and I just stopped in my tracks. For some reason I was completely not expecting her to care about me in that moment. I couldn't calculate any personal benefit for her to ask me that, so I just froze for a few seconds before recovering and saying I'll be okay. That's how bad my cynicism is sometimes. To be fair, I was raised with a somewhat social darwinist ideology in my family/culture.\n\nI have found that I dislike collaborating with others to some degree. I like having full control over the piece that I am assigned to work with so I don't have to worry about making any compromises to anyone.", "clean_guess": "INTJ", "llm_guess": "INTJ", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.06358275}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -3.4383137}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -4.079042}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -4.6470046}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -7.615354}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.7718387}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.939613}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.517955}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -8.549159}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -8.565951}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -8.669797}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.674201}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -8.981387}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -9.474973}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -9.814971}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -9.830756}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -10.116717}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.259503}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -10.29906}, {"token": " ENT", "logprob": -10.3282175}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.30033877}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -1.3492813}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.916}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.335325}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -14.689592}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -15.237574}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -15.330759}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.552475}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -15.567448}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -15.760931}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -15.937979}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -15.96888}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -16.168615}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -16.439383}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.445852}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -16.51182}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -16.592354}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -16.606453}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -16.737137}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -16.792284}]}}
{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am 24 years old and a man, I'd say I'm quite reserved, stoic, and unexpressive, I enjoy exercise in the form of gym, general sports with friends and some combat sports. I've in self improvement for a while now and want to work on becoming better, I've also started a business but haven't worked on it much if at all due to just being lzy. While I don't enjoy my station in life I generally enjoy it, my ultimate goal is to help people on a large scale in some way, mainly through the medium of healthcare or tech or a combination of both. My natural bent is towards large scale societal changes to impact the future generations and improve, though I am also curious about other things such as science and art. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNot that I know of \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nNo real religious structure, aside from a few times where we went to church, Christmas, easter etc, I treated it as part of tradition and didn't mind since I played with other kids there. As I got older I began to value certain traditions and am now Christian. There was a lot of structure from my parents which I appreciated and help me a lot, I apply structure to my own life but I believe a little differently to the one given in childhood.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI studied neuroscience, and have worked in jobs unrelated to it, I didn't like them as they were repetitive boring tasks which had no real difficulty or point, they didn't help me towards my goals, and were just a means to generate income. I seem to prefer more mental tasks probably because they remind me of my study. In future I want to become a doctor, and occupy higher positions within that field. \n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would enjoy it, most of my weekends involve church and seeing others, but a nice weekend, especially getting away in a small city etc would be extremely pleasant and refreshing, I think it'd be a great time to reflect over the events of the week, where I want to go and how my actions impact my direction. Although sometimes hanging out with others during the weekend is good too.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nMy coordination is poor within sports, and like with most things I get better mainly through tons of repetition, e.g with combat sports I practice certain attacks and combos until they feel natural and intuitive. I want to explore more of the outdoor world and also enjoy gym, climbing etc. I do like sports once im good enough to play them. I also enjoy reading, whether it's philosophy or manga etc. I want to get into art as I did it quite often as a early teenager. \n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI definitely have a lot of ideas of what I would like to do and accomplish, I would like to learn to cook gourmet dishes (at least 3-5 in a year),  I want to have an amateur mma fight, I want to build my business, I want to travel often and recreate certain things I see. However I do have plans and structure to help me do these things. My ideas can be a mix of both, It depends on what is inspiring me. I try to narrow down my ideas to the things I like most. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?** \n\nI think in future I would enjoy taking on leadership position, in the past I have been put into them due to achievement and having a direction for my own life which may cause others to want to follow me. I've struggled with leadership positions in not knowing intuitively how to get individuals to follow since im more solitary but I want to build up leadership skills necessary in future. My main way of leading comes through leading through example, being diplomatic and having a vision for the team. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI'm not too coordinated but I'm not too clumsy either. Less so than most people but not obviously so. I haven't worked with my hands in a while but I remember fixing my bike, looking into my car and some product design projects which required use of my hands, they were great for relaxing and focusing on one task. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI used to draw and write poetry when younger but haven't done so in a while I would like to start. When I consume are its usually in music, I don't mind more abstract music or even non serious forms. With paintings I enjoy realism and surrealism. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI don't think too much about the past unless it's to inspire me, the present is great as its readily available to manipulate for a certain more improved future but also to just enjoy. \n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI don't mind too much, can be annoying if I have to leave something im doing at the moment. I would help them due to a sense of obligation. \n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI would say so. \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nDepends on the task at hand, if its just fun then not too much, if it comes to accomplishing certain goals then It is very important in my life, until I reach a point of long term stability, however other than that it should be ok. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI control others possible through actions, I act on certain goals and try to do them regardless of others opinions, this may cause others to do similar.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nCombat sports feel amazing, use of entire body, can be strategic or tactical, constant self improvement, fun to fight others and learn from each other, inspires discipline, can still improve alone, with another person or in a group. I enjoy learning to play guitar and cooking mainly to find other forms of art to enjoy and in future show this to others. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI enjoy sitting down a reading through text to fully understand it, then breaking it down and testing myself. I enjoy competition too. I struggle the most with group tasks and action oriented work, it seems too distracting, to focus on others and what is being done over the content. \n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI'd say when it comes to goals, strategising is fairly straight forward, I start with an end goal or point, break it down into long term, mid term and short term goals/actions, and break it down into weekly/daily tasks with weekly admin check ups. I like to also leave time to wing certain things and improvise. But I do not freestyle most of the time. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nMy aspirations include becoming a doctor, building a business to a high degree within 6 - 8 years with room for more. Retire my family. Then improve other aspects of my life including getting to the peak of my physique, marrying a woman I respect and starting a family. Enacting a specific change on society to help others in future. \n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI fear not being competent enough to help myself and others. I fear not being able to accomplish what I set out to and being restricted to certain ways of living. I hate needless cruelty, one of the few things which makes me quite proactive in doing something about it. I believe it relates to my goal to help others/ world.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nSucceeding, taking in the physical beauty of certain parts of the world around me, helping others in family and celebrating wins of other people.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nAnger, giving in to vices. Not working hard enough. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI daydream very often but am easily able to snap back to reality quickly. I'm also aware of my surrounding when I do so.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI reflect on my future and what I want out of it. I think about my life so far and why it is this way and if this is what I want. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nNot too long maybe a week or so depending on the decision. With reasonable arguments I may change my mind. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nemotions are important to life and the human experience in general. It takes me a while to process mine, I believe they may be quite childish and may need more development in future. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI agree with others point of view and try to offer alternatives unless I have other opinions which might enhance the conversation through discussion. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often?

{"submission": "1) How would you describe yourself?\n\nHighly self-directed, independent, free spirit, very friendly, always amused about something, assertive but able to be tactful, adrenaline junkie, highly intense/piercing energy\n\n2) What are your aspirations? And values?\n\nTo be a nomad and travel the world going on adventures. As for values, I think the only one I really have, is freedom/honouring others' free will.\n\n3) What do you spend your free time on? What do you daydream about?\n\nDoing a million projects/ideas at once (note: I have ADHD so this may be independent of type), fitness, and self-improvement for sure. I daydream about success half the time, the other half, I daydream about being a literal god lmfao.\n\n4) What would you change about the world, if you could?\n\nDefinitely less red tape and restrictions, and more second chances to people. People shouldn't be barred from life over a drug conviction. The only exception being child abusers/rapists. Off them unceremoniously. People shouldn't need licences for every little thing, and there are too many safety rules imo. Also, intellectual property laws are way overboard, and it stifles creativity.\n\n5) What's your general view of people? Including people you love and dislike\n\nThey're just animals lol. They amuse me most of the time. Even people I dislike (I don't actively dislike anyone unless they've done something against me or a loved one), I kind of get off on purposely annoying them (in a way where I won't get in trouble, that way I can keep doing it. I love the reactions lmao). With people I love, that's different. I can be VERY protective of them, and I put them first when it comes to major decisions (within reason).\n\n6) What limit (i.e. time, gravity, etc.) bothers you most?\n\nfucking EVERYTHING lmfaooo. laws of physics. laws of biology. human-made limits especially; it's pure masochism. This world in general feels like a type of jail that I'm trying to repurpose into a playground lol.\n\n7) What's the biggest thing people don't often notice about you? And why do you think this is?\n\ni'm not as snooty and distant as I might seem (irl). I just have pride issues, so I refuse to give my time/attention to others first because I won't allow anyone to think they hold power over me. But if they approach me and reveal themselves honestly to me, then (assuming I like them to begin with) I'll make sure they never regret it.

{"submission": "if you've seen a similar description before, it's not surprising, as it's just a much more complete version of it.To begin with, I have absolutely no clear opinion about myself. And perhaps this will be one of the few things in which I am sure. This also applies not only to me as a person, but also to my overall perception and ability to process information. In past reports, I did not write this, since I remembered only recently, but apparently it went on since childhood. The fact is that in my deep childhood I had excellent abilities for self-hypnosis and an equally terrible memory as now, in principle. One way or another, because of this, I confused real events with fictional ones, or simply confused real events with each other extremely often. I sometimes argued with my relatives because of this (they thought that I was deliberately inventing and lying), later I became aware of this problem, based on some facts, so I can write about it now.Anyway, I'll try to go to the description:\n\n1. I am weak-willed and timid. I do not remember exactly my first meeting with a stranger (which is not surprising), but my parents told me that I was afraid of the people around me in childhood, except for my closest relatives. I was even afraid of my own brother. I practically could not talk freely with anyone except them and a couple of people until about 5 years old. Therefore, my parents began to send me to many circles and extracurricular activities. In general, they managed to socialize me, but I acted by adjusting to others (later I got too carried away with him and got into not the most pleasant situations, losing control over them and completely forgetting myself, so now I, before joining a company in communities  , I analyze it, and if it seems to me personally acceptable and comfortable, then I make attempts to adapt).\n2. I also struggle with feelings of embarrassment and shame from early childhood. (I noticed this trend: the more I communicate, the more this feeling overtakes me, being alone and processing all my actions lately). However, the problem is probably not so much in the amount of communication, but in my perception of what I can be ashamed of. I myself do not clearly understand my values, so I'm not sure. I made attempts to ignore my feelings, because sometimes I had to be in a team by force. However, in the end, nothing worked out, I myself do not notice how feelings sometimes cover me. Then I thought that since I can\u2019t change myself, it\u2019s easier to change circumstances and I just try to minimize most contacts. However, there are often outbreaks and I break down, repeating the same mistakes. Heh...\n3. I am a big procrastinator. With difficulty I force myself to do something, again from early childhood, from primary school. Later this problem got worse. I also have a hard time concentrating my attention sometimes even on what may be interesting for me, not to mention complex unwanted material. I am a moral weakling and if some lecture or text seems difficult to me, I automatically switch off and go into my thoughts. Even forcing yourself to deliberately penetrate comes out with difficulty and not for long.\n4. Concerning doubts and a way of adjustment. I was often told that the reason for this may be the lack of support for the expression of one's own desires, personality on the part of the parents, but in my case it was quite the opposite. My parents always tried to develop this in me, they were interested in my desires, but I never really knew what I wanted. Heh:\\_)\n5. I can definitely say that I value emotional and material stability. I am much more comfortable in a permanent environment. I can hardly stand various kinds of trips, I do not seek to change my physical environment. I am also good at recognizing my physical inner sensations, which I often did not like, as I cannot ignore any discomfort, no matter how hard I try. Emotional stability is easier for me to leave to my surroundings, since I myself have problems coping with my feelings, so I always look for the society where it exists by default.\n6. In general, I am almost always aware of my surroundings (at least I do not have complete blackouts in consciousness), but I do it vaguely, almost never delving into its details. So I usually don't default to making up the big picture based on the details around me like people with se-ni/ni-se do. Most of the time, I'm in a semitone in my thoughts. As far as I know, this is the most common case.That's all for now lol. Thanks for reading.

{"submission": " \n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest fear? My biggest fear is getting rejected. Whenever I get rejected or treated like and outsider, I get really angry and end up getting caught in the moment and I might do something I'll regret. What\u2019s your biggest desire? To have a peaceful and organized environment. What are you \u2018\u2019the best\u2019\u2019 at? Reading through people's intentions and knowing how they feel. How do you see yourself right now? Normally? I don\u2019t know about this question. How do you see yourself 5 years from now? Working like most people? I don\u2019t know for sure what I\u2019ll be doing, I just know I\u2019ll be alive. How do you express yourself? Through my environment. My environment influences my mood a lot so if my environment reminds me of bad parts of my past I might act rude or so on. How do you feel about those near you (family, friends)? I have had a bad relationship with them so I don\u2019t know quite honestly. How do you feel about strangers? I usually care too much about what they think or when I'm overwhelmed I'll be very rude to them. How do you view change/uncertainty? I hate it. It makes me feel weird like I start to question other things too or just stress about the change. How do you make decisions? Based on how others would react to it and objective facts. How do you solve logical problems? Using objective logic. How do you deal with your emotions? I bottle them up until I cannot hold them in anymore and explode on people. What drives you in life? What do you look for? The thing that mainly drives me in life is peace and comfort. What do you hope to accomplish in your life? Again I just want an organized and peaceful environment as I don\u2019t do well in chaotic environments because they overwhelm me. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you? I avoid being weird and avoid doing stuff that makes me feel out of charecter. I have too many values to put here. How do you want others to see you?

{"submission": "Hello. Oh  no, writing stuff about myself?! I don't even know who I really am..... or do I? Guess I should have kept my username Eternallyconfused instead, haha. So I'll just use this life saving guide prepared by yall.\n\n \n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nSheltered upbringing. Surrounded by the 4 walls of the room. School was the only activity I had. Became more and more quiet. Slowly lost all friends and didn't really know what to talk about and how to behave like a kid of that age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nLonely. Bored. Even though weekdays can be tiring and I look forward to the weekends....I've observed that spending whole day by myself makes me feel cranky and low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nI love swimming and have self-trained myself watching youtube videos. Dont know how to play any other sport so cant comment on the same. I read and try to learn new things, but after a certain period of time I find it really difficult and might get fidgety and irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am quite curious and tend to think of doing new things. I've even tried making Youtube videos while I was stuck at home for a while. I think its more environmental as I keep thinking about creating something with my hands or to go out and interact with the environment outside. I like understanding concepts and questioning them.  I follow stoicism and find it to be quite helpful and interesting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nYes. But I don't like ordering people. I would do my own bit but make sure others are doing their bit too and that their opinions are also being taken into consideration while taking a decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nIm not really sure about that. Most of the times I am stuck in my room with my thoughts which can make me overthink n feel a bit lost which is quite common and natural. But yes, I like working out when I do and feel better and in control of my surroundings when I move more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI like helping people. I guess, I like being needed. But if they repeatedly ask for help, it gets a lil annoying coz they are just using me then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nIt is important. I feel disappointed in myself if a day passes by and I do nothing of value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI don't like it when the speaker is continuously speaking and we are supposed to just listen to them and understand. I like interactive sessions where I'm a part of the process. Also I'm not a fan of rote learning. I like visualising and find flowcharts, mind maps etc to be useful too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI used to fear a couple of things, but now I don't. It was difficult to put myself out of my comfort zone and face it but now I feel great. But there is one thing I fear and sorta dislike... and that is flowers. I dont know why. Other pet peeves of mine are: unnecessary talks, interruptions while speaking, very loud people and hypocrites.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nUsed to, as a sort of escapism. Still do sometimes when really bored or stressed. But I'm aware of my surroundings while I daydream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nDepends. I struggle with indecisiveness sometimes but I'm trying to overcome it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI sometimes used to. But usually I say my point only when I think its worth it. Otherwise, I just ignore n stay silent or try to change the topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI usually follow rules as they are made to prevent chaos. But if something doesn't make sense, I simply try not to follow it or raise my concern. I do not pick unnecessary fights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nI want to experience as many things as I can in this short time I have. My ideal life would be to do as I please without being controlled or forced to live as others want me to. I'd Like to spend more time with nature and explore this world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, Thank you for reading this lengthy post of mine.

It was irrelevant at the time. \n- Would stay away from everyone. \n- Very very good with athletics and could easily outrun everyone. \n- Didn\u2019t actively try to become more creative until I was 15. Until this age I was not described as creative. \n- Weirdly enough I was extremely organized at this age. Everything was put in its place and my supplies had different categories as well.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16budvx)", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": "ISTJ", "logprobs": {"IST": [{"token": "IST", "logprob": -0.018423948}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -4.309861}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -5.7916384}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.2299166}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.923007}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -8.173682}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.763522}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -9.971368}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.0149355}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.316812}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -10.986745}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -11.613805}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -11.6191435}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -11.75677}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.039954}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -12.116771}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.199939}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -12.305499}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -12.365447}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -12.419471}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -1.4855664e-05}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -11.172619}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.489241}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.59585}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -15.757315}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -15.77216}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -16.528992}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -17.777365}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -18.185951}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -18.254955}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -18.375465}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -18.506866}, {"token": "K", "logprob": -18.595196}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -18.662178}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -18.875984}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -18.933493}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -18.940018}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -18.98212}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -19.171076}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -19.305988}]}}
{"submission": "i've always identified as an INFP but i never quite related to how much of the focus is how the world breaks down their creative passions. its hard for me to read about an INFP talking about their childlike softness and creativity and imagination because i understand i am an INFP yet i dont feel like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni would not really categorize myself as creative, nor a daydreamer. I have a talent for painting, and the arts but im more focused on the technical aspects and how im improving in terms of anatomy, composition and color selection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni can relate to how they are intensely aware of how certain things will affect them, but i dont relate to the feeling of how the world is pushing them to abandon sentimentality and creativity in pursuit of society-aligned interests like productivity and economic output. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthat kind of thing is something i readily accept and feel is necessary in order to meld together into a cohesive unit that will get things done. it's just a natural consequence of belonging to an entity, your high-marked individuality is not necessary and at times disruptive to the goal of the company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nit doesn't mean i dont get sad about it ever, of course there are values that i do not feel comfortable that companies are crossing, but i recognize it's the natural order of things. i don't lament much about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nat the same time, i refused to identify as an INFJ for the longest time because i didnt want to feel like i just wanted to adopt the label because of how \"its the rarest personality type\". that kind of accusation makes me want to crawl into a hole and die. i dont want to be a mistyper, i just want to know my objective type so i can start highlighting it as my strengths instead of only focusing on my lack. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni wouldnt say im a person who is interested about mechanical things necessarily either. although i have passions for computer science, and deduction, which are very technical things. which made me believe i was INTP for a while. i used to debate about religion when i was a kid just to rouse people up and i found it fun to have argumentative conversations in that way. however i cringe at that these days since i realized how uncomfortable i was making people and how bad i probably looked, as a person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni find people much more fascinating. i genuinely am interested in learning about them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhen i ask about someone's day i try to figure out if i can glean more information about the person without asking them directly, and try to figure out their sole directive in life. i think that's weird and kind of pretentious (and im not even saying im that good at it) but i genuinely love it lol. like people are puzzles to me there's always something new to discover or dig deeper into if you just look at them in another angle. that kind of curiosity and enthusiasm is probably what leads to some people hating me because it's uncomfortable to reveal that much upfront or liking me immediately and pouring their life story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni'm very limited though because that same intensity makes me unable to function in group settings. im too focused on the depth of a single person that its hard for me to keep up with the energy bouncing between multiple people, i end up just being quiet and laughing at people's antics. if i can get over the anxiety i can sometimes crack in a joke or two that gets everyone laughing but my whole directive is being a very engaged listener and absorbing information about either the group's dynamics overall or narrowing my focus to one specific person and their reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhobbies are cool and there are some hobbies that i am definitely mechanically interested in (in terms of actually wanting to learn more about it on a technical level), but most of time time im more curious about how that hobby fits into that person's personality. it's just really cool to know about what they value in life and im endlessly interested in figuring out a person's facets.

{"submission": "Here\u2019s my attempt at doing the questionnaire! Keep in mind I can get very formal when responding to questions and this isn\u2019t my casual way of speaking. Also I\u2019m physically unable to answer questions without over-explaining myself so, enjoy! ;D also I link to my quiz results if anybody needs them! But please help me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nHello! I\u2019m 17F, have ADHD, the type I usually get in tests is INFP, ENFP & ENTP follow closely behind. My enneagram is possibly 4w5 & my tritype is 458(?) I enjoy dabbling in all things art from drawing, to music/singing, to theatre, to writing, comics/manga, shows/anime, movies, and much more that I don\u2019t want to think too hard abt, but you get the idea. Even as a child, I\u2019ve always saw myself as a soul within this meat suit just floating through life. An observer of sorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI have very strict traditional Asian parents who are very religious. (ESxx mother & ENTP father) Thankfully I\u2019ve researched about my own religion enough to separate culture from religion and know when they\u2019re parading culture or their own ideals as \u2018religion\u2019 and I\u2019ve always strongly retaliated to it, which has gotten me in trouble with my parents many a time. Other than that, my parents parenting style was.. all over the place. There was no proper structure, if anything it was *lacking* in structure. No specific dinner time, chores were divided randomly and quickly neglected, and any attempt to have any kind of structure would all end in vain since nobody in my family is ever on time to anything nor can they conform to a schedule. I used to be very neutral about the unstructured thing, it was all I ever knew, and in a way I saw my freedom in that sliver of a grey area. But sometimes my parents constant lack of stability does bother me, especially when *I\u2019m* expected somewhere and have to rely on them only to come egregiously late. A lot of their parenting also seemed to hinge on using intimidation in order to gain obedience, but after a while I learned to ignore it anyway & became better at hiding things from them. As the saying goes, strict parents make sneaky kids. Although don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t abstain from some nice malicious compliance before rubbing it in their face;)\n\nI was also completely online schooled for my entire life so I grew up on the internet, and my parents didn\u2019t take steps to socialize me or my siblings, so I had to take my own initiative to learn the social game all on my own\u2014 albeit rather late for my age. Nothing will bring back all those pivotal years I\u2019ve missed of understanding the social structure, and even more-so as a neurodivergent person, but it is what it is and I\u2019ve done the best I could with the cards I was dealt. (or at least I hope)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What career path are you interested in pursuing? \n\nEither in art or science (specifically biology pertaining to the natural world, biologist, botanist, marine biologist, etc). Art is a hobby, a passion of mine, which is why I\u2019m unsure about taking it as a career. I fear it might make me lose my passion for it, it\u2019ll become a chore rather than a de-stresser. If I did take art, I\u2019d be a concept designer or character designer since those bring me joy, but it doesn\u2019t pay as good as science either.   \n\n\n*  If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nDepends. If I have been stressing myself out and hanging out with too many people I\u2019ll *need* that weekend to relax and realign myself. If I haven\u2019t spoke to people in a long time and I\u2019m going to have to spend a whole weekend alone, I\u2019d likely be very lonely, buuut I can self entertain and make the best out of it and forget about it in no time. But I can go a long time before reaching that utterly lonely point, it kind of just hits me one day how alone I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI\u2019m very dissociated from myself and reality. I\u2019m always lost in a thought, although I can never recall what since I have the memory of a goldfish. I lose some grasp of reality when I daydream and have to get torn out of it, the world around me just becomes a buzz when I\u2019m zoned out.   \n\n\n*  What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nRelated to my previous point, I have to make an effort to be in sync with the real world, I have to remind myself I\u2019m a real person and push myself out to capture memories or the feelings of the moment, but even then it\u2019s like sand slipping past my fingers. I do like being immersed in the natural world, but as the background to zoning out or to tuck it away into my lil folder of creativity in my brain. There\u2019s something about it that soothes some deep part of my soul and puts me at ease, I used to love playing or studying outside even if it meant playing alone for hours. I\u2019m unable to do that now, but the natural world still brings me comfort.   \n\n\n*  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would call myself a very curious creature, I can thread thoughts and string out a whole web of ideas in no time. I like exploring everything or falling into a million rabbit holes at 3 am. It\u2019s usually hypotheticals that I explore, \u201cwhat would happen to earth\u2019s tidal & oceans if the moon was destroyed\u201d, \u201cwhat would life be like if 95% of the world was covered in water\u201d, and more. I also love exploring real life phenomena, or stupid cryptid shit with that little kid at the back of my mind hoping more than anything that they exist even if I know better. I also love anything about extinct animals, especially ones humans weren\u2019t able to document well like prehistoric animals or dinosaurs. I think I gravitate towards hypotheticals and things just beyond reality because I love that gray area of not knowing the full truth for absolute certain and being able to freely imagine what it could be like. \n\nI also love learning about things so I can use them as inspiration, like I use all my knowledge of evolution and anatomically accurate animal biology I\u2019ve attained to make mythical creatures in my worlds seem like real creatures.   \n\n\n*  Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI\u2019m currently somewhat in a leadership position right now, I\u2019m the VP of one of the biggest clubs in our school. I like to think I\u2019m better at taking an adviser role in leadership rather than the final decision maker. I am more than happy to dump my never-ending supply of ideas and have someone else refine it down or make decisions. However, if I was forced to pick just one idea at gunpoint\u2026. I might as well already be 6 feet under.   \n\n\n*  What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI\u2019m both afraid of and look forward to the future, it\u2019s too unpredictable but there\u2019s also so many opportunities!\u2026 but oh god there\u2019s so many opportunities\u2026 what am I supposed to do?? What if I make a single incorrect choice that ends up messing everything up for me? What if I completely miss an opportunity because I didn\u2019t grasp for it in time? The future gives me strife so I prefer not to think of it too hard or I might actually lose what\u2019s left of my sanity. \n\nThe past I hold dearly, especially my childhood, I\u2019d do anything to turn back time. I think that\u2019s a coping mechanism lol. I analyze my past and how it affects me now, I even make connections on why I act the way I do because of my past.\n\nPresent, I don\u2019t really know what I do. I exist. I try taking opportunities as they come, but I also just live in silence in my own head most of the time. To be honest I\u2019m not really sure *what* I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf it was my friends I would do anything for them, drop everything, even if it means putting them above family. Keep in mind that\u2019s only out of my own will, I *want* to do that, if I didn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t even bother offering or accepting. I like making the people happy or just make their lives easier, it fulfills me. Just in general with anyone, I just trust my gut. If I want to help them, I will do everything in my power to, and if I don\u2019t want to I won\u2019t get out of my way too. More often than not I\u2019ll want to as I see it as a fun challenge and if I do accept you bet your ass I will disregard my entire life schedule to help until things are solved.   \n\n\n*  Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI have a reasoning for a lot of the things I do, I don\u2019t like doing things with no reason behind it (but I find myself doing that more often than not). I have a subconscious that figures things out for me and every time I purposely didn\u2019t listen to it I\u2019ve messed things up for myself. I kind of need a rule of some kind to something, even if small, just so I understand the parameters\u2014 or if something doesn\u2019t have any written rules but has a pattern, I feel the need to vaguely follow that pattern or I feel I might do something wrong. But I\u2019m also always very open to new ideas or concepts to expand my worldview, so I never see anything quite as set in stone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nRarely. I think I get controlling if I get invested in or feel strongly about something, or someone took something I was looking forward to doing. Example: say I worry heavily about cleanliness, if I see someone I know washing a dish sloppily I\u2019d probably start nit-picking the way they\u2019re washing it because I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to get sick from eating from that dirty dish. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s something out of my control and I worry it isn\u2019t going to be done properly to it\u2019s fullest, and since I can\u2019t do anything my reaction is to try and fix it or mold it to my vision even if it\u2019s not exactly my place to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nSince I have ADHD settings where I can see a clear examples playing out and I prefer a clear explanation behind it, so I can break it down to a formula in my head and reuse it later to a somewhat related thing that I can reasonably guess follow that same pattern. However, I prefer classes where I don\u2019t have to think too hard, it just comes to me naturally or I can use common sense to figure out the answer easily. So I suppose that\u2019d be classes that help me utilize logic & creativity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI\u2019m good at strategizing, especially for others, but I\u2019m unable to follow through on my own since my motivation drips down the drain really easily. I will say maybe I tend to overestimate how much I\u2019ll be able to do since I can\u2019t gauge myself that well and end up feeling disappointed in myself. I usually end up procrastinating until the very last second where I grind it all out at once, and somehow I work better this way.   \n\n\n*  What's important to you and why?\n\n1. Treat others like how you want to be treated (literally). A more extreme example (that I do) to get my point across: I\u2019d like people to call me out on my shit, so I call people out on their shit. \n2. My friends are incredibly important to me, sometimes irrationally so. I\u2019m very picky about who I keep around or close to me, so if I approve of a friend they\u2019re a friend for life. \n3. My art & work. It\u2019s something I work hard on that I\u2019m proud of, it\u2019s also meaningful to me. \n4. Being valued in a dynamic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What are your fears? \n\nI\u2019m afraid of being a bad person. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m a self absorbed prick, or that I make people feel bad, or that inherently at my core I\u2019m not a good person and I\u2019m masquerading my entire identity. Obviously it\u2019s not black and white like that, but it truly is something that eats away at me sometimes. To be fair, I suffer from confidence issues and anxiety so I worry about a lot of things. I over-analyze every single thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\n*  What makes you uncomfortable?\n\nI can\u2019t stand it when people have pre-conceived notions things about me out of nowhere. Especially if they try to push it on me when all they\u2019ve seen is a fraction of my life, they don\u2019t have the right to define or label me. I like knowing what people think of me light-heartedly, but when it leaks through that was what they genuinely thought of me it just. Ugh. It just rubs me the wrong way, you wouldn\u2019t catch me dead doing the same. Another thing I don\u2019t appreciate, when I set down a clear boundary and it isn\u2019t listened to even when I draw the line everytime. I\u2019m not your mother, I don\u2019t have to spell out every word for you. But honestly, I\u2019d distance myself before it even got to that point LMAO. I also find it weird when people feel *strongly* about certain things, just so blindly. Like \u201cI **hate** dogs\u201d, just an example but it\u2019s like? How can you make such a strong statement about something so general? Something that makes me panic, when people decide things too quickly without thoroughly looking through all the options fully to know which one will end up being the best possible option in the end. I will never get tunnel vision. Something that **actually** bothers me, when people take things others have confined to them and spill it to everyone else like it\u2019s their business. Even if you think it\u2019s not that deep, it was never *your* choice how deep it is to THEM, when your given information just assume they wouldn\u2019t want you to tell anyone unless CLEARLY proven otherwise. \n\n*  What do you hate?\n\nI hate arrogance, ignorance, closed mindedness, self-absorbed people, or just in general anyone who acts like the universe is centered around them and will listen to their every beck and call. I hate it when people speak sickly sweet words to you and speak ill of you behind your back with that same tongue. If you have a problem, you say it to my face. I hate being stifled, my voice being dismissed, not allowed to do what I want to do with *my* life. Having to live out someone else\u2019s expectation for me. I hate it when people walk past people suffering or in need of help but either don\u2019t see it worth their time or are afraid of what other people think. I hate it. I could go on, but I hate the cynical mindset it puts me in so I prefer to ignore all this exists in order to keep my hope in humanity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI\u2019d probably get bored or uncomfortable since I don\u2019t like sitting in my thoughts for too long due to my level of overthinking to the point I\u2019m constantly distracting myself with things so I\u2019m physically unable to, but I\u2019d explore my thoughts, memories, stories, and characters. And probably have a meltdown.   \n\n\n*  How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nForever. I was never really given control over my own life due to controlling parents, and I think that affects my decision making skills. I\u2019m completely unable to choose anything on my own unless I\u2019ve had the opinions of others and talked it through to truly figure out how I feel about it. Even then, the edge of my mind is always wondering if I even made the right decision in the end. I do obviously weigh the pros and cons and figure out what *feels* right to me, but I will doubt my choice no matter what. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI find myself not realizing how much something effected me until I suddenly process it randomly and it just.. *hits* me. And it crashes down on me. But after I realize it I\u2019ll start dissecting it in order to figure out why I felt that way and why it had such an effect on me. I think emotions r great, feel \u2018em, live \u2018em, leave \u2018em. I believe emotions should run their course because if they get bottled up they\u2019ll boil over much worse than before. And at that point it gets sticky because you can\u2019t control who you\u2019ll explode on, so it\u2019s better to understand them than hide them. It\u2019s called being \u2728healthy\u2728\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nMost of the time I\u2019ll politely disagree and explain my viewpoint, or even if I agree I\u2019ll point out another perspective on that same issue so we could have a nice open discussion. Although, if I\u2019m done with them & realize this conversation is going nowhere fruitful I\u2019ll try to end it there. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll get into a heated discussion with them and probably tarnish my image to them even if on my end I genuinely didn\u2019t care about it that much. The only time I catch myself agreeing just to agree is if it\u2019s someone I just met so I give them the benefit of the doubt, but if I feel *very* strongly about something I wouldn\u2019t blindly agree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nI don\u2019t believe rules should be broken often because they\u2019re there for a reason, but if you genuinely feel it goes against everything you stand for there\u2019s no point listening to it. If I broke a rule it\u2019d be for something that caused mine or someone\u2019s natural rights to be violated by these rules, authorities aren\u2019t perfect & can be corrupt and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d just let that slide just because of their position. I wouldn\u2019t be loud about breaking the law because I wouldn\u2019t want to face repercussions, but I\u2019d do it to protect or save someone even if it meant putting my life on the line in order to do so. I think in order for there to be a healthy system authorities *need* to be constantly questioned and challenged even if they\u2019re objectively right.   \n\n\n*  What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nHappy, healthy, making excellent bank, beautifully decorated cottage at the edge of the British isles with a forest in the back and a beach in the front. Adopted kids, married or single, feeling fulfilled in what I do or how I\u2019m living, a self-sustained garden, having family or friends near me, raising our kids together like siblings. Constantly traveling with my girl friends or spouse. Living idly and comfortably to its fullest.

{"submission": "She is my former middle school science teacher (and she has actually taught middle school science for a fair amount of time. I had her for seventh and eighth grade. \n\nI remember that she tended to specifically like hands-on activities in the classroom herself, and I think she once mentioned that this was the way she tended to learn things herself. I remember that my former best friend (ESFP?) disliked her, as she regarded this teacher as being too strict/not letting them having enough fun. A lot of the kids in my grade did not like her, but my grade was particularly toxic, so I\u2019m not sure that this actually matters a whole lot. I remember that my former best friend regarded her daughter as being a \u201cbrat,\u201d though I must note that my former best friend had said this in part because her daughter once shoved her, and that I don\u2019t have the impression that her daughter has turned out badly (she does strike me as being an involved parent. Interestingly enough, she was with her husband for about a year before they had their first child, and I don\u2019t have the impression that they have an unhealthy marriage.) She has two children, a daughter and a son, and does post them sometimes on her social media. I would say that she is average looking (not \u201cthin,\u201d but I would guess that this is moreso because she had two kids at a later age - she was born in 1971 - more than anything else. Her sister is overweight, so perhaps it\u2019s genetics as well. Her husband is overweight, too, and her children aren\u2019t \u201cthin.\u201d) \n\nCome to think of it, I actually seem to remember having the impression that this particular teacher did indeed notice the weight of others - when she met my mother (I get into that more below,) she was immediately judging her for being overweight, and I remember she once noted that someone was \u201cskinny\u201d in class (not a particular student, it\u2019s like a vague memory.) \n\nI was a teacher\u2019s assistant for one of my middle school teachers, and I recall that once my math teacher and a different staff member were having a conversation and one of them suggested that this teacher \u201ctalked\u201d to her, and said this like it was surprising (didn\u2019t say it sarcastically, exactly. She just kind of said it like this teacher was not/is not the type who actively makes an effort to befriend the other staff members - like she was or is the type that may keep more to herself.) This teacher later on suggested when I reached out to her years later that she was bullied when younger, and wants to be an \u201cadvocate\u201d for students who are being bullied. \n\nI mainly remember her now because she nominated me for an award/put my name in for a \u201cmost likely to succeed\u201d award\u2026 and when she met my parents, she read them correctly on the spot. It\u2019s like she knew they were bad people before I ever did. She was judging them as soon as they sat down - she mumbled \u201cew\u201d when my mother who is overweight sat down. She was still polite to them, but did not like them and I knew this. She mumbled \u201che did not turn out well\u201d when my mom mentioned that I have an older brother (my father is an unintelligent alcoholic who I do feel to be noticeably off. Neither of my parents said or did anything particularly abnormal, she just read both correctly, and quite literally did not like them as soon as they sat down.) She somehow understood that my parents weren\u2019t good parents, and I think she suspected my mom to be abusive (she once looked concerned when my mom came up to the school even though she still said hi when my mom said it. I had the impression she thought my mom was abusing me. My mother wasn\u2019t physically abusing me, but I have realized as I have grown older that my mom definitely has the potential to be abusive, and my mom actually has \u201chit\u201d my brother before.) At the time I just thought she was being judgmental, but about a year later my therapist called CPS due to my parents\u2019 failure to act when my brother (who is in rehab) did something gross, and I experienced particular trauma toward the end of eighth grade in part due to my parents\u2019 negligence, so she actually read them correctly. I remember that at one point, during this brief meeting, she briefly had a look on her face like she was wondering how I\u2019d turn out/whether or not I\u2019d turn out well (I think she wasn\u2019t sure.) \n\nShe had forgotten when I reached out about a year later that she had ever met them at all, though, and assumed that I have good parents (I do not have good parents.) \n\nI\u2019m not so sure that she read me correctly, though. I remember I actually owned a gossip account in middle school and cyberbullied many of my classmates (my classmates really did suck, though) but I don\u2019t think she read me well enough to understand that I was doing anything like that (I obviously am not like a sociopath or anything, I\u2019ll just admit that in middle school I was probably one of those people who thought myself to be kinder and more noble than I really was.) \n\nThis is a bio she wrote years ago: \u201cI\u2019ve taught 7th grade science since we first opened up our doors in 2010, but this is my 12th year teaching at this site, and my 17th year of teaching middle school. I initially went to college to become a doctor. I loaded up on science and math classes, but I went to university of Colorado and the mountains were calling to me. By the time graduation was coming up, I decided I needed to travel before I did anything else. I studied for six months in Costa Rica, I graduated, packed up and moved to *won\u2019t specify state* where I would save money and find somewhere else to go. After working and coaching and swimming for 5 years, I realized I enjoyed being around kids and helping them learn and improve upon new things WAY more than I liked working in an office. I went on to get my teaching credential and I\u2019ve been teaching middle school ever since.\u201d (I wrote in won\u2019t-specify-state. She did specify the state herself.) \n\nEven though she is an adult, I suspect that she did have an idea of which students in her class she felt were \u201csmart\u201d and which she felt weren\u2019t (or, well, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I just think that she had an idea.) She sometimes looks awkward in photos. She is active on social media a fair amount actually throughout the day, even if and when she isn\u2019t posting anything/posting pictures of her children. \n\nIn general, I get and always have gotten the impression that she is *somewhat* cynical, but I will note that I don\u2019t think she was someone who didn\u2019t care about children at all.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16dylk0)", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": "INFJ", "logprobs": {"INF": [{"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.0385609}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -1.1292839}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -1.6953659}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -2.163332}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -5.128727}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -5.7347317}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -6.0047245}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.098093}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.364191}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -6.849472}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -6.905802}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.9092026}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -7.034239}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.204218}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -7.206274}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.3240147}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -7.4861984}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.720503}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.64201}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -8.931694}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -5.7961847e-06}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.443518}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.625603}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.593021}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -16.824682}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -16.898294}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -17.069971}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -17.407661}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -17.544247}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -17.71727}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -17.857939}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -18.389025}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -18.493708}, {"token": "...", "logprob": -18.503902}, {"token": "Q", "logprob": -18.542215}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -18.642904}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -18.658539}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -18.878527}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -19.111551}, {"token": "JS", "logprob": -19.180487}]}}
{"submission": "I'm fascinated by the Enneagram and I'm taking a look at MBTI and Socionics now. Before researching too much myself I would like to get some input. I hope it's okay that I'm using a questionnaire that I already filled out for the Socionics sub. As far as I can tell the questions aren't too different.\n\n**Section 1**\n\n*How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?*\n\nWorking is a difficult subject to me. I used to have different jobs (at a bank, as a nurse, in a laboratory), but I usually immedietely felt that this is not it. So I did it for sometimes just days, sometimes a couple months if it was bearable. Now I deliver newspapers at night and highly enjoy that. I work alone, can listen to music/podcasts and just be in my zone. I'm going to start a job working with addicts soon though. That's part of my university degree. My goal for the future is to be self-employed and I'm currently taking the steps to achieve that. I want to be my own boss since most of them fail to be human. Basically our whole system fails to be human and while it's interesting to observe and understand I don't want to be sucked in. I prefer staying alive, most people seem to die more and more as they work those tortured 8 hours a day. I don't mind effort if it's on my own terms or if it's demanded with heart.\n\n*How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?*\n\nThe highest quality fully resonates and comes from an inner place. Force and necessity are part of this world, but they lack the \"holy\" aspect of things that come right from your soul.\n\n*If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?*\n\nI guess I research or ask someone? It depends. Yes, I usually know if I'm better or worse than other people.\n\n*How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?*\n\nAgain: success comes from resonation and an inner place. It's about whatever rises from your soul when you are still or in a flow.\n\n**Section 2**\n\n*What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?*\n\nI usually get a feeling about a whole which would basically be a sum up of a situation or an end of a situation. Yesterday my best friend texted me that she felt sad. I immediately envisioned her sitting in her bed, depressed. L\u00f6st in darkness. Leaving her university. She is undergoing a transformation process at the moment. She is trying to find her own way. Today she texted me that she just had issues with her hormones, but I know what's going on and I'm pretty sure about it. I wouldn't fight about it and I'm open to being wrong, but I'm probably not. So I would say that there is usually a main thing about a whole situation and it's important to put attention to that.\n\n*What does \"logical\" mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?*\n\nIn my personal experience people often use the term \"logical\" to basically shit on anything that's based on emotions or any higher truth. I don't care about logic, I care more about being open to being wrong. In the past I used to be sure of things based on pretty much nothing. That included the weirdest spiritual believes. I experienced that the openness to being wrong made me much wiser. So I'm trying to keep that in mind. Other than that I believe that our intuition and our body tells us what's right. Feelings and thoughts can be a part of that, but they can be deceiving.\n\n*What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.*\n\nHierachies are used to keep people small. Like a boss treating his little slaves like bots. In an ideal world hierachies would be used to split respobsibilities (and getting paid according to that) while still treating everyone like a human being. The worst hierachie in this world is the 0,1% of the rich and powerful. They want us to be dumb slaves and they want more money and power. It's obvious how they are trying to achieve that through literally any system that we have. It makes me feel sick. They make us fight with each other instead of fighting them. They suck the life out of living.\n\n*What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.*\n\nThings having a natural order and naturally being in the same class. Like when I sort my clothes. Some shirts are for going out, some for lazy sundays and some are for very specific situations.\n\n*Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others' ideas?*\n\nI know my ideas are consistent if I follow my intuition. They at the very least are a necessary part of a bigger development then. If I follow what others want I begin to live in chaos. Sadly I'm a huge people pleaser, but I'm working on it.\n\n**Section 3**\n\n*Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?*\n\nI can and I (rarely) have, but there is no point. Anything that doesn't come from within is pretty much worthless.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I have used emotional manipulation in the past. I'm a good liar and I'm good at making myself appear like the sweetest, nicest and also the most helpless person you've met. That combination is extremely powerful.\n\n*How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?*\n\nIf I want something I try to get it. Weird question. I don't use others to get what I want if that's what's trying to be figured out here.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.23155102}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.9570206}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.0579822}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -4.683648}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -5.7988424}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -5.8071756}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.126525}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -7.717931}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.803237}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.888055}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.952346}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -9.325311}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -9.3818655}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.407317}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.505841}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -9.62016}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.648393}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -9.880462}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.30058}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -10.330077}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0024785085}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.4305754}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -7.868325}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -8.508363}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.937591}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.019187}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -10.394095}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -10.788203}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.676709}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -12.280055}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -12.504777}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -12.770167}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -12.93327}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -13.115312}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.231828}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -13.301454}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.500667}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -13.507768}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.519334}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -13.622962}]}}

I do not want to change for someone else, i''m myself and i'll always be like this, if you don't like me there's the door imo.  \n\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16eef5g)", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": "ISTJ", "logprobs": {"IST": [{"token": "IST", "logprob": -0.23503636}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -1.9018989}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -3.4072547}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.2572875}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -4.795385}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -5.862369}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.8744082}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.767011}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.456967}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.581437}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -9.911466}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -9.9175005}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -10.083249}, {"token": "Ix", "logprob": -10.089799}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -10.206975}, {"token": " I", "logprob": -10.667422}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -11.133403}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -11.168277}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.377923}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -11.380435}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.08023248}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -2.5629232}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.40003}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -12.87624}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.098276}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -13.613758}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.8705635}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.068254}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -16.372303}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -16.703709}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -16.793945}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -16.835455}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -16.858896}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -16.896887}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -17.047089}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -17.072872}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -17.111586}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -17.239035}, {"token": "K", "logprob": -17.271175}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -17.30057}]}}

{"submission": " I would be more than happy to explain any further for those who have any questions :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?** \n\nYes, I grew up in the Mormon church, and even though I liked and complied with it as a child, It just wasn\u2019t really the place for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m a Barista and I like it for the most part, The problem I have with it at the moment is mostly management and the lack of leadership and accountability for anyone involved it\u2019s genuinely just such an annoyance.\n\n1. **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nRealistically, more like a mix of Anxiety and refreshing, especially if there\u2019s just anything out of the norm.\n\n1. **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI like drawing, writing, outlining, and then like yeah board games with the family or online. I\u2019ve never described myself as being good at sports, nor do I enjoy them, I like the idea of playing baseball but again it\u2019s just the idea. The only outdoor activities I remember doing and enjoying as a kid were mostly fishing and camping but other than that nah.\n\n1. **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nMost of my \u201ccuriosities\u201d seem to be either linked to studies within the humanities and the social sciences, so things like Politics, History, Economics, Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, etc. I don't think I have too many ideas than I can execute, however, some ideas will definitely take a lot longer to draft out and genuinely create more than others, not only that but like for a book it will take even longer with editors and publishers and whatever other nonsense that I\u2019d have to deal with. I would say most of my ideas in nature are much more conceptual, Again most of them are Ideas but to use a basic example from my liberal arts class, I used Carl Jung\u2019s work when It comes to the collective unconscious to find universal symbols or justice and moral acts of what we nowadays would consider being good vs evil. \n\n1. **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI would never admit it but I think I would absolutely enjoy being in some sort of leadership position, I think It would fulfill some of my control freak thoughts. I can only hope to be good at it but I think I would be competent enough. I want to say Tough but fair, I want things to run as effectively and as correctly as possible but I\u2019m fully aware that some ideas and things are blatantly ridiculous, and if someone doesn\u2019t want to comply they shouldn\u2019t have to, as long as justifiable reasons as to why.\n\n1. **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nNo, it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve never been too good at, I suck at throwing, I suck at catching, and I can just be too in my head sometimes to actually be aware of my surroundings at all times. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy working with my hands either.\n\n1. **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nYes, I would describe myself as artistic/creative, the type of art I make would definitely depend on the medium that I am using, like for the rare times that I paint I do so with the idea of making abstract patterns and ideas, when sketching or drawing digitally its more to create a basic idea and concept of a character for a book in my own style based in Japanese games like persona and other different kinds of styles as well.\n\n1. **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nPast**:** I Have regrets and things I wish I could've done better but there's no point in wallowing in them\n\nPresent**:** I try my best to be in the present moment but it escapes me, I zone out a lot\n\nFuture**:** where my head likes to be at the most, pondering ideas about politics, personal life and their consequences, fun, almost existential stuff like that :)\n\n1. **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\ndepends On what it is, if it's an emotional or psychological problem i almost immediately jump right into action and help those in need, if it's something like helping move the couches or other \"physical\" activity then I'll likely roll my eyes but still help anyways, but bitch about it before, during, and after.\n\n1. **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI don't think its that important to me but it's nice to have nonetheless. \n\n1. **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI Would like to be more productive and more efficient, in my life, I think It would help immensely.\n\n1. **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI Don't really like telling people what to do, i think people are perfectly capable of figuring stuff out on their own but if i have to i will say something \n\n1. **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nmbti, Writing, drawing, learning. Why do I like them? Because their interesting and enjoyable, these activities help stimulate my brain.\n\n1. **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nMy learning style is mostly auditory, I enjoy listening to lectures, podcasts, stories, and those stuff. I would say I struggle most with the kinaesthetic learning, idk just being dropped into something and expected to understand what to do is kind of ridiculous to me and that's also the reason I prefer audio learning it's much more convenient. I prefer both logical and creative classes\n\n1. **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI would say yes? Personally, I have no real problems with breaking up projects to make them easier to manage, I can also wing it though if i do you should expect not the best results.\n\n1. **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nProfessionally: I\u2019m still trying to figure that out about myself all I know is that I want to be able to build something important, and make enough to support myself and any family I might want in the future.\n\nPersonally: I want to be satisfied, I want to be full of something I want to pursue meaning.\n\n1. **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nFears: purposelessness, emptiness, being unlovable, dying alone, all that fun stuff :)\n\nUncomfortable: confrontation, talking about myself, touching, PDA, \n\nHate: politics, corruption, hookup culture, government, incompetence, lies, inaction, war, ignorance, hedonism, you get the point.\n\nWhy?: I don\u2019t know, it seems as though Hedonism is the common culture of today, Maybe it\u2019s just in the States, but it feels as though I can\u2019t relate to anyone anymore, It all seems like today's culture is driven by some sort of cult of sex, money, and luxury goods you can\u2019t afford. It seems like everything is spoon-fed to us by the corrupt elites at the top, to make our lives miserable enough that you go to indulge in every impulse you have just to make the pain go away. I don\u2019t really know though It\u2019s just easy to get angry when you see the potential for how much better things could be. I just dislike the way things are run in my country and I\u2019d like it to be better lol.\n\n1. **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?** \n\nDefine a High. No seriously  I really can\u2019t recall I\u2019m sure I've had some, it just difficult to remember since I\u2019m going through a stressful moment in my life. I want to say middle school? It was just a better time, I had a good group, I did well in classes, I argued with some kid in the cafeteria about the 2016 election, and it was overall a good time.\n\n1. **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI think it\u2019d look something like this; It's 3 a.m. and I\u2019m contemplating whether or not I\u2019ve made the right choices and stressing about what comes after, thinking about certain responsibilities I have that I wish I could get rid of, thinking about projects that need to be turned in, that kind of stuff.\n\n1. **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nYes, I would describe myself as an active daydreamer, I think I tend to hide it well enough for people to still be convinced that I\u2019m present in any given conversation though. I would say yes and no, I do my best thinking while I\u2019m walking, There have been times when I\u2019ve tripped and almost got hit by cars, however, it\u2019s not that common. \n\n1. **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nIn all honesty, I\u2019d probably start to talk to myself, I\u2019m not crazy, I just like to think out loud. I\u2019d likely think of the same things i always tend to think about, government, politics, philosophy, books, my own stories, themes, ideas, movies, and video games. I just have a strong interest in social studies and liberal arts.\n\n1. **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt takes me a minute, I not allowed to make mistakes. I have to make sure that my head, heart, and my natural abilities are aligned before I make a decision. I hate the feeling of doubt, but yes it may take a few weeks those thoughts nibble at the brain, of how much easier it would be if I went down this other path instead and I hate it. \n\n1. **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nAs a child, I was very emotional and slowly with age I began to grow out of all the crying up until middle school where I began to push them down a little bit and would continue to do so until I realized that I didn\u2019t really feel anymore, and as of lately I\u2019ve been doing better at understanding myself and these repressed emotions that I've been hiding from myself. I feel as though I\u2019m a better person than I used to be.\n\n1. **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes, but not to keep the conversation going but to make the conversation stop. If not for that reason then I agree because I want to hear more of what their brain has to offer and how deep they keep going. I don\u2019t know the reason I just think People are incredible and interesting.\n\n1. **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don\u2019t really break the rules unless I think they\u2019re stupid, then I break them, like if a sack of doughnut holes are about 5 bucks I\u2019m going to put more in there cause that's bullshit. I think authority should be challenged 100% especially if they\u2019re incompetent or detached, I understand why rules exist and understand why some are important but then there\u2019s another bunch of rules on the side that no one really follows and at that point, they\u2019re not rules.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.63512343}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.8466275}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.8901722}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.1386445}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -4.2397203}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -4.5537634}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -4.8270674}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.3278704}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -6.6706743}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -6.706067}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.5577765}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.963813}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.138183}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.294099}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -8.346957}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -8.888915}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.974605}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -9.081777}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -9.188224}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.3158045}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.3153262}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -1.3077254}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.720396}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -13.084854}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -13.366074}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -13.581194}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -13.685968}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -14.217941}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.562532}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -14.726168}, {"token": "ENTION", "logprob": -14.760836}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -14.926588}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -15.128494}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -15.426546}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -15.697161}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -15.863337}, {"token": "ERRUPT", "logprob": -15.972706}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -15.990988}, {"token": "-P", "logprob": -16.028175}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -16.089243}]}}
{"submission": "Hello, I\u2019ve been trying to find my type for a very long time, thought I might need some help, I\u2019ll be answering some of the questions (might do more if I\u2019m still not sure) from the guidelines.\n\n1.If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n-Probably refreshed, best if I have a book to read or something to research on my phone, although might feel bit lonely if remained in this state for too long (let\u2019s say a month)\n\n2.Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n- No, being the leader gives me the pressure to be perfect. Lot of times in group projects I see how the group can improve or perform better but I don\u2019t voice my opinions much. \n-Again I won\u2019t be a good leader, although others might think I am. \n-My leadership style will be redoing everything. I enjoy doing things myself so won\u2019t ask others to do a lot.\n\n3.What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n-Past: I\u2019d say I have a good long term memory, but I mostly remember my mistakes. I sometimes refer past events to present situations, like \u201cWhat does this remind me of?\u201d? Generally not enjoyable.\n-Present: I often have my head in the clouds, I do try to \u201cinsert\u201d myself into the present but end up tripping or bumping into things.\n-Future: I can\u2019t say I\u2019m future oriented, but I do see myself planning for it. I often think people are too present oriented or unrealistic about the future. I also see the consequences for my actions\n\n4.How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n- I have a hard time saying \u201cNo\u201d because I don't want to be seen as selfish. Sometimes I do like helping others as I want to be liked more than hated, and I like seeing them being successful from my help. Generally a passive helper.\n\n5.What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n-My biggest fears are complete darkness and the feeling of being useless (or seen as useless).\n-Loud noises, crowds and prolonged eye contact make me uncomfortable.\n-I dislike being told what to do because it feels like losing independence.

{"submission": "First, some backround:\n\nI have recently began to doubt initial thoughts about my type. I considered myself an INFP for the longest time, pretty much since I first began to take MBTI more seriously. I started out with 16personalities which was always extremely confused and couldn't help but switch between INFP and INFJ so I started looking deeper, learned cognitive functions etc. but it hasn't helped me figure out my type. My best guesses would be INFP, INFJ and INTP, INTJ in no particular order. I am still relatively a noob at this, so I can't say that they are accurate but I provide them anyway and will go into more detail about why I have entertained the thought of being all of them at certain points.\n\nThe reasons for my confusion:\n\nI took a multitude of tests, all of which type me as an INFP with two very significant exceptions that typed my as INFJ. Truity (which I know isn't very reliable, so I just passed it over originally) but Sakinorva then also had the same results consistently (I took it multiple times). This basically was what made me begin to have doubts. But then I made other observations in my life (which I will talk about below) that made me begin to doubt whether I'm a thinker. I fear that I may have taken the tests with an unconcious bias and answered in order to \"fool\" the test that I am an INFP because various important people that I admire were INFPs, such as J.R.R Tolkien. Or at the very least a feeler type, because of the same reason.\n\nMy personality traits:\n\nI am very interested in art. Music particularly since it is the only one I am competant in but also other forms of art such as painting, film, literature, poetry etc. I do consider myself an iNtuitive because, except for an edgy phase, I've cared much for symbolism and abstract concepts. I like to ask questions that are extremely theoretical and utterly impractical (ex: If all humans gathered together really closely and jumped, would our collective mass be enough to move the earth?) I also don't consider myself a Sensor since I have no particular affinity with tools, I am clumsy and quite often disoriented. I find theory a lot easier compared to practice and often feel I lack the afformentioned practical capabilities required to make use of theoretical knowledge. I take criticism very personally and emotionally. I have even cried when presented with criticism about me that was personal, and I strive to never allow anyone to critique me. I do this by ensuring that I am harshest to myself in order to meet the standards of the world with more ease. I doubt my self a lot, though I think that is evident, and often compare myself to others. I am very insecure and competitive. I quite frankly despise my urge to compete with others, hate myself for not measuring up etc. I know that those impulses are unsound.  I am mentioning them as think they could help somewhere in the typing but I digress. I was convinsed that I had Ne aux but then again Sakinorva argues for Ni dom so I'd love some clarification on the matter. Furthermore, although it isn't cognitive functions and thus likely irrelevant I still want to mention it: I read that INFJs are more orderly whereas INFPs are spontainious generally. I place great value in traditional values, customs, ideals etc. and the organizations that are as a guide to life from the past. This would point to me being INFJ according to that standard. However, I despise to-do lists, put off doing work with a deadline until the very last days before its end etc. If viewed in isolation, those traits would make me an INFP This is probably cause for much of the confusion as they might seem contradictory.\n\nFeeling vs Thinking\n\nUsually, and the reason I considered myself a feeler for a long time is that I greatly value morals. The same traditional outlook I usually have applies here. And yet I often find myself arguing for the side of \"reason\" and \"logic\" against idealism. I too would love if the world was perfect, there was no corruption, no poverty, no wars, all was in harmony but I understand that such a dream is unattainable and even an aproximation of it requires a lot of individual effort. Then there is my view on reality as being something fundementaly... real. Unchanging; there are certain laws in the universe which cannot be remade and those are the logical, factual things which we observe. \"I feel that...\" is not a valid arguement to me. \"The right thing to do is...\" is however valid to me, and I enjoy moral problems. I can provide emotional support and solutions to problems when I see another is troubled, however I tend to offer the latter more commonly and I appreciate when it is offered to me. I can be viewed as cruel, judging, and cold (most of all, to myself) and I may not like it that way but I have to admit that it is needed in many situations. This might just have to do with the fact that I am a man, and gender does play a part in this, but I am very intereded to see what it means from the perspective of the cognitive functions. What I want to know is: Is this Ti dom and my Fe inferior function makes my feel that I am unnaturally uncaring? Maybe Te inferior backlash against Fi? Is it perhaps that I am an Ni dom as Sakinorva suggests and these are just the auxilary and tertiary functions? This is my largest concern and any insight is greatly valued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStereotypes:\n\nI am neither a hippie nor a rebel so the infp stereotype doesn't work. I do work, I can be extremely productive and I don't have a problem with finding determination to get down and be productive. I only get anxious in stressful situations, time pressure and competition make me uncomfortable and often put myself in bad positions with deadlines (but never fail to meet them!) so the INTP stereotype also doesn't fit me. I am not a \"rationalist\" and no longer concerned only with empirical evidence to prove everything but I still see them as critical to problem solving. I am a christian, but not just for the Rousseau-ian emotional aspect of it and belonging and the traditions but also the rational arguements behind it, such as those made by Descartes and Kant. I doubt the notion that being religious has anything to do with being a thinker or a feeler, more to do with intuition. Thus, the stereotype of INTP's being anti-religion is also not applicable. I believe in biology, physics, mathematics etc. of course, and although I find them rather dull and not to my tastes (I prefer to understand humans by art, history, literature etc.) they are our tools for understanding the world around us, which ought to be understood. I consider this a nuanced opinion which doesn't particularly feel fitting to categorize within any of the stereotypes. (Feelers arguing that something is real because they want it to be real or thinkers arguing that nothing can be real unless proven with data). This section about stereotypes is an \"excuse\" if you will, to present some more information about myself but through the lens of mbti rather than plain real life examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the idea for each type:\n\nINFP: Most tests say so, I believe that I have Ne-Si, I have a strong sense of morality and values etc.\n\nINFJ: Things of INFP apply, but trusted tests say so and I am not that uncomfortable with hierarchy or routine (even though I do not enjoy the latter).\n\nINTP: I commonly support positions that have to do with logically resolving issues. You could say that I am a \"facts don't care about your feelings\" guy, but I personally still care about feelings which is why I am not sure about either INFP or INTP as I see some of myself in both. Still true if Ne-Si guesses are right.\n\nINTJ: If indeed I have lied subconciously to the tests hoping to be a feeler type and the results are INFJ, then the conclusion is that I am an INTJ. If I indeed am Ni dom, it simply switches the auxiliary and tertiary functions so really not too big of a deal.\n\nIn fine, I came here in order to resolve my doubts as to my type once and for all. I have provided some information (if it is insufficient please feel free to ask more things), some of my observations about myself and some thoughts, reasons I doubt test results and my own typing by functions, how I don't fit within the stereotypical view of any category in full. Any and all help in figuring this out is appreciated. Sorry for the long read and thank you for your time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S If the flair is wrong, tell me please.

When i arrived at the supermarket,i stared at the ice creams for 1 minute because i was indecisive,eventually i picked one.When i went to pay,the line was huge.I got sweat up for a bit because it was hot,and then an old man approached me and said to go in front of the line because i only had one ice cream,while others had dozens of aliments.So i got a bit sweat up and became a bit anxious,i went in front and then i thanked all of the others for letting me in front of the line with a neutral face in order to seem normal and casual,i never thought that they would let me in front of the line,so that caught me off guard,that is why i had a neutral face,in order for them to not see how i feel.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": "ISFJ", "logprobs": {"IS": [{"token": "IS", "logprob": -0.2611586}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -2.5023103}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.6915708}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.0264707}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -4.016188}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -4.62242}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.3349824}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.915133}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -7.7571397}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -8.697942}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.045909}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.584052}, {"token": "INE", "logprob": -10.120986}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.232083}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -10.692725}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.709071}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -10.840121}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -10.89524}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -11.06277}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -11.424331}], "F": [{"token": "F", "logprob": -0.16509113}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -1.882773}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.194533}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -13.45143}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -14.92797}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -15.622342}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -16.73034}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -16.762703}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -16.866385}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -17.074951}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -17.546907}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -18.047005}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -18.378092}, {"token": " TJ", "logprob": -18.545599}, {"token": "DJ", "logprob": -18.604126}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -18.752155}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -18.920599}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -19.026737}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -19.06007}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -19.40196}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": 0.0}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -17.578564}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -18.269262}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -18.328684}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -18.858301}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -19.625551}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -20.568811}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -21.02218}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -21.4502}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -21.621235}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -21.753077}, {"token": "...", "logprob": -21.86183}, {"token": "JI", "logprob": -21.908974}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -21.955524}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -22.002502}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -22.252419}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -22.322098}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -22.504759}, {"token": "t", "logprob": -22.68402}, {"token": "Per", "logprob": -22.83314}]}}
{"submission": "When I was a teenager, I used to have this 'frenemy' that would constantly follow me around, eavesdrop on conversations I had in order to reference things I said and bond with me through that, and SMS/call me nonstop during our last year of school together. During that time in my youth, I was an aggressively mentally ill, nihilistic loner (unhealthy enneagram 5 alert), so I initially dismissed his offers at closeness as thinly-veiled attempts to mock me behind my back with his buddies because of his overt fuckboy personality and bourgeois lifestyle/demeanour. I even insulted his intelligence in such a crass manner so much that his responses to my badgering went from passive-aggressive teasing to straight-up impulsive angry jabs at my repulsive attitude and appearance. However, looking back on it now, I can see that all of the things he\u2019s done for me were attempts at comforting me and trying to help me become a part of the group as a result of him being extremely sensitive to the predicaments of my debilitating neurological impairments.\n\nI always thought that he was an obvious ESTP since he mostly thought about materialistic things (golfing, his status in society, appearance) and always enjoyed living in the present moment (partying, being shamelessly kinky/horny) whilst getting frustrated at me for overthinking things instead of taking action. He also would devote a significant amount of our arguments to bluntly criticising how I chose to present myself to others through immensely detailed similes, as though implying that my behaviour was so 'ugly and nasty' that it reminded him of a spooky spider that creeps and crawls underneath one\u2019s desk, and that I\u2019d never succeed in life acting like that. On the other hand, during those arguments, he\u2019d also make these ominous predictions about my future that ended up being eerily accurate to how my life ended up turning out, which I would acknowledge in the back of my head but was too delusional in my image to confront head-on. This makes me consider that his Ni is higher in his function stack than I was initially led to believe, especially when one takes into account that he was 16-19 years old when he had these premonitions about me. But idk, what do you guys think of this?\n\nP.S. \u301c I\u2019m sooo sure he was enneagram 3 and had 378 as his tritype.", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": "ESTP", "logprobs": {"EST": [{"token": "EST", "logprob": -0.9910655}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -1.3869357}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -1.7958617}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -2.2863612}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -3.3800292}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -4.052192}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -4.277124}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -4.706245}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -4.9894557}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -5.4195113}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.4265037}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -5.7001452}, {"token": " ENT", "logprob": -6.234678}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -6.3963847}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.422973}, {"token": " ES", "logprob": -6.7264037}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.859985}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -6.9891734}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -7.117618}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.1244674}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.014270576}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -4.2570305}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -13.654448}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.70079}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -14.503328}, {"token": "E", "logprob": -14.510479}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -14.599485}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -15.25536}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -15.396545}, {"token": "N", "logprob": -16.623943}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -16.813147}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -17.08237}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -17.196358}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -17.234957}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -17.440311}, {"token": "M", "logprob": -17.464283}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -17.528917}, {"token": "W", "logprob": -17.751835}, {"token": "D", "logprob": -17.76093}, {"token": "B", "logprob": -17.847078}]}}
{"submission": "i have tried different online tests and every time i do them i get a different result so i genuinely have no idea what i am because i somewhat relate to every type... so pls help based on my answers from the questions in the pinned post, many thanks to anyone reading this personal reflective essay\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\ni am 21, female, i can speak 4 languages (cantonese, english, japanese, mandarin chinese), and i'm now studying in japan.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\ni used to suffer from depression and had antidepressants from 2019\\\\\\~2021, but i'm now completely off meds and am not seeing a therapist (so that means clinically i'm recovered); also got a diagnosis for asd but it's like very borderline so i don't think it matters much\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\ni'm born and raised in hong kong with a brother who is 5 years younger than me, so it's your typical asian parents and education things, and my family isn't religious nor we actively participate in any religious heavy traditions (except the traditional chinese new year etc). my parents had high expectations on my academic performance and wanted me to receive \"better\" education that i was sent to a private school, but my dad passed away when i was 11 that kinda crushed the family for a while but it's a happy family in general. oh and i have moved houses for \\\\\\~8 times my whole life too.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\ni'm still a student but i have worked part time jobs in tutorial centres (that also serve as a childcare centre), now i'm in japan i just work in a sushi shop's kitchen. i have pretty much enjoyed most of them, as i wouldn't have accepted the offers if i didn't like them in the first place.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\ni mean i now live alone and i'm already spending weekends all by myself, so honestly it's quite nothing, it's like breathing air, i don't necessarily feel either lonely or refreshed, it's just... a part of my life now yknow?\n\n\u2022  What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\ni prefer indoor activities and i do not like sports at all, sweating stinks eww, well but if it's sports that can be done indoors i don't really mind them like going to the gym or doing yoga at home, but they aren't really something that i would actively do on a regular basis. i usually just spend my free time watching youtube or anime or just be on my phone/computer, and i can sit in front of a pc all day.\n\n\u2022  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nit really depends if i am interested in that particular topic, if i find myself interested i can go on with discovering that topic for a long time (months or sometimes years). and usually my ideas are stemmed from something existing - so for example i'm watching a video on youtube then i would think how can i create something similar to this but in my style? what even is my style like? so a lot of times i really feel like creating a youtube channel to execute all these ideas but thing is i literally want to do so many things that my channel would probably just be a whole mess of pretty much everything, for example i once bought a microphone cuz i wanted to record covers of my favourite songs (but i never liked how the videos turned out to be, mostly cuz how much i dislike my outlook), and i once bought a camera because i wanted a vlog a trip (but end up breaking it in the middle of the trip), and also i tried uploading english translation of some japanese videos but they took a lot of time and energy to create that i did like 3 and gave up. there was also a phase that i was into online novels then i tried writing my own, but then i ran out of ideas that i literally didn't know how to end my story so i gave up halfway lol \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\ni used to be active in these kind of situations and would fight for every single chance to be a leader, but after actually being one in high school by leading a whole school club, i decided not to touch this position anymore because i realized that how unfitting of a leader i was. however, in a lot of social situations, i just felt like i had to be in this position because no one wants to do, but it's not like i want to be one either. my leadership experience had been criticized as \"demanding\" and \"expecting everyone to follow exactly what i say\", which was true because i got really mad when i expected people to hand in something that they are supposed to do but they did not at all and decided to do other things instead.\n\n\u2022  Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nmaybe yes, i follow instructions pretty well and i think i deliver what people expected me to do most of the time. or sometimes i finish what i was told to do a little too fast that i may appear that i have nothing to do. and yes i like doing diy's, every piece of ikea bought furniture at my home is assembled by me and i handle most of the tech things around my social circle too, from dealing with wires to fixing their pc's.\n\n\u2022  Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\ni don't think any aspect of me can connect to the word artistic at all. i do not understand art nor i have an idea on what an artist thinks via their work. when i encounter \"what does the author really mean by ...\" type of questions in an exam my immediate thought is \"why am i supposed to know? ask the damn author on how they think\". even when i say i enjoy anime i don't really think about how this scene is expressed and what meaning or metaphor does this particular scene have behind it, i'm just here for the overall enjoyment.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\ni feel like someone's past shapes their personality at present, and i personally do not believe in the predictable future (like horoscopes or crystal ball things), and i believe that one's future is on their hands. in other words, i believe that a person shapes their own future. but if you're asking me how i feel about the objective past, present and future... honestly i don't really feel anything? in a macro scale, i very much agree with people saying that history repeats itself, and i don't really feel hopeful for the future as i don't really have much faith in the world we currently live in is going to be a better place.\n\n\u2022  How do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\ni would mostly try to offer help within my range, because i can't really think of a good reason to reject someone. i really hate when i have to turn down a request too because that's pretty much the only time that i feel somewhat important to others. sometimes i feel like i do a little bit too much that i look back i felt like i shouldn't be spending this much time on them, for example my friend was once struggling on which laptop to buy that he came to me for advice, then i typed out a whole google document of laptop comparison and gave him a whole lecture in that document on how to pick cpus etc, and that costed a whole night's sleep.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nvery much yes. i would freak out if something doesn't go in my expected range.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nyes, because of the environment i grew up in, everyone values efficiency and productivity. everyone acts very fast and doesn't have a lot of patience. for me, i am somewhat influenced by this kind of culture that sometimes when sometimes doesn't go efficiently i would ... not exactly freak out? but it certainly doesn't feel good at all. i guess \"worried\" is the closest word i can use to describe this feeling. and this applies to both mine and others' efficiency and productivity. although i am a heavy procrastinator as well, that as i am typing up this post, i actually have my math homework to be completed.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\ni have no idea how to do that. ok maybe when i used to suffer from depression and was suicical i probably did something similar to emotional blackmail to gain people's attention (which turned out to be a failed attempt as well), but i didn't even realize how much i hurt them until very recently. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nwatching anime, because ... idk it has become a habit for years now. it just feels familiar (probably because i know japanese) and a safe escape from reality. also listening to music, mostly japanese and english modern pop/rock music, because... again it feels familiar, and sometimes i relate myself to the lyrics especially in the rock sector. (it's mostly pop punk so yknow a little bit of rebellion things and a little bit of \"IDK WHAT IM DOING WITH MY LIFE\" things)\n\n\u2022  What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?\n\ni prefer learning things where i can get myself involved into it. so probably my physical senses, as they create a better concept in my head by actually experiencing them. unfortunately typical asian education is just asking you to memorize this and that and i have a small brain. and i struggle with morning classes because i just CANNOT stay awake until at like 11am. other than that i think i can learn pretty fast once i get the hang of the new things that i have to learn.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nyes i think i can pretty much break up big goals or projects into small tasks, because i myself need very extremely clear instructions in order to start doing something. but i allow some degree of changes as long as they are well discussed and proved to work better than the current plan. and please let me know when you have to make a change. PLEASE.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nhonestly i have no idea, i feel like my goals or aspirations change every 5 months. i have no idea what i really want to pursue in the future either, i just feel like i need to get a university degree because i have to or i can't find jobs, and i need a job in order to sustain my living or i will live on the streets, and other than that i can't really come up with anything that i really want to do. even if tomorrow is the end of the world, today i would probably just sit at my home and spend the last day of my life as usual. or im probably gonna go to a well receieved ramen shop to have my last bowl of ramen.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\ni mostly fear people? i don't like crowded spaces because i fear people will look at me thinking im some kind of weirdo; i also fear that people will betray me in the next second, i fear that people secretly find me annoying that they actually don't wanna hang out with me, and i fear that i don't meet others' expectation that i would lose what i currently have (for example, my job). i feel uncomfortable in crowded spaces (but public speaking is fine) (i think i have some kind of agrophobia but it's not like it's professionally diagnosed or anything), odd-number groups and/or being the odd one out. i hate people who refuse to listen to others' opinion, know-it-alls, conflicts with other people (but i get into them VERY easily for some reason), and also people who play dumb. so you see it's mostly people related and basically i hate people.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nwhen i got all the attention and compliments when i was a kid. then it just get worse as i grow up. if it means the high moments in my life then i guess i get super energetic and motivated that i can work nonstop without needing to eat or sleep, and also i become extremely talkative that i would even start to talk to myself, that now i have a plushie with me that acts as some kind of imaginary friend so i feel less lonely.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nprobably when i had depression, i felt like all my fears (mentioned above) are true, i felt paranoid that everyone secretly hates me, and it felt like i was screaming into a void. i was actively suicidal as well. if it's not something this low, then i just sometimes lose my motivation in doing everything and just lie on a sofa for the rest of the day mindlessly scrolling on my phone.\n\n\u2022  How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni daydream quite often, but most of the time its being lost in a train of thoughts and lose focus on my surroundings (which counts as daydreaming i guess?), and i think i'm like half aware that i'm daydreaming? it's like i got focused on my thoughts but at the same time i am aware that my focus is on them\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nprobably just lie down and stare at the ceiling for a while, and fall asleep eventually? depends on how long i'm in that room, if after i wake up i still can't go outside of that room then i would start to freak out and/or worry about a lot of things\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nit ranges from 1 second to forever. but once i made a decision i rarely change my mind on it.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\ni'd say they process relatively slower than an average person, for example when something really bad happens to me, my brain is mostly blank as an immediate response, then the emotions would hit like a few hours later or a few days later when everything is calmed down. for example i rarely cry when watching movies, but the emotions would hit at the night before i go to sleep.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often?

Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nno, i follow the rules as long as they align with my morals. i feel like the authority is not absolute and is always up for challenges and possible changes, but i'm usually not the one to do so. most of the time i just complain privately but i'm too coward to speak against an authority.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": "ISFJ", "logprobs": {"IS": [{"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.0406508}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -1.2609763}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -2.4432654}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.4600997}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -2.776485}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -2.7980971}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.156633}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -4.728107}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -5.4825397}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.75205}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.120939}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.045856}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.2494597}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.29746}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -7.5799823}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.7087665}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.7723308}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -8.17362}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.309919}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -8.378986}], "F": [{"token": "F", "logprob": -0.5309326}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.8871681}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -9.411309}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.921319}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.275857}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.409696}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -12.448834}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -12.787549}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -13.602326}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.8585005}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -14.001094}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.38366}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -14.625602}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -14.954654}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -15.170539}, {"token": " T", "logprob": -15.299443}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -15.535026}, {"token": "NJ", "logprob": -15.677091}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -15.848224}, {"token": "(T", "logprob": -15.956286}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -1.2664457e-06}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.076142}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -15.24779}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.822368}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -15.91525}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -17.21761}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -17.595057}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -17.642088}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -17.681429}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -17.744976}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -18.00186}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -18.041113}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -18.08166}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -18.31492}, {"token": "...", "logprob": -18.588121}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -18.637545}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -18.698105}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -18.823746}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -18.856005}, {"token": "Q", "logprob": -18.90449}]}}
{"submission": "After research I narrowed down my main functions as Fe Ti Ne Si - ISFJ/ESFJ/INTP/ENTP, however I relate to them all. This is my full questionnaire, which of the 4 types do I sound most like?\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\-Probably refreshed, best with a book or phone, might feel a bit lonely staying in this state for too long (maybe a month)\n\nWhat is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\n\\-I trip and bump into things more often than others, not very aware of surroundings. I prefer indoor activities like watching movies or playing games rather than outdoor activities, but taking a walk on cloudy days sounds nice.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\-I consider myself pretty curious, always asking \u201cWhy?\u201d and \u201cHow?\u201d. Usually when I see or hear something new, I do deep research on that topic. Sometimes my mind comes up with ideas of new projects and connections from things I\u2019ve seen, a lot of them cannot be executed.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\-No, it gives me pressure of being perfect. Others may vote for me as leader, but I don\u2019t have much confidence and do not enjoy the job. My leadership style would be redoing everything as I find it hard to understand others\u2019 work.\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n\\-Lot of times no, I think much faster than I move, like speaking. I am the worst with my hands, even if someone shows me how to do something I cannot repeat it, but I like playing musical instruments.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\-I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m good at drawing, I like doodling and creating something new. I\u2019m also good at drawing anime/cartoon characters. I very much appreciate music as a form of art, makes me imagine scenarios.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\-Past: I have good long term visual memory, and I dwell on past mistakes. Sometimes I refer the past to the present, like \u201cWhat does this remind me of\u201d. Generally do not enjoy thinking of the past.\n\n\\-Present: I have lots of thoughts and often have my head in the cloud. Try to focus on the present but fail.\n\n\\-Future: I\u2019m not particularly future oriented, but am planning for it. Often telling others being too present focused. Can see consequences for my actions.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\-I have a hard time saying \u201cno\u201d because I don\u2019t want to upset others and be seen as selfish. If I actively help someone it\u2019s either they are looking too helpless or I want to see them succeed on behalf of me. More of a verbal helper. \n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\-Very much, I hate it when peoples\u2019 words don\u2019t add up (although I do this too as it\u2019s hard to explain my thinking process)\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\-It\u2019s important when I\u2019m in a rush to do something, but generally I prefer doing the right thing even if it takes a long time.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\-Sometimes, to see how things turn out. I do this indirectly like controlling others using words and body gestures that seem normal.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\-I haven\u2019t found a \u201ccomfort hobby\u201d yet, but I do enjoy researching, reading and watching videos about topics I like. I like to be clear about things and want to know more about it.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most?\n\n\\-I\u2019m a visual learner, also learn from self researching. I struggle with loud environments and group brainstorming.\n\nWhy do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\-I can\u2019t focus in loud environments, sometimes I don\u2019t get others\u2019 ideas in group brainstorming. I enjoy classes that involve creativity and can acquire knowledge, also like small competitions in classes.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\-I ain\u2019t bad at improvising but strongly prefer having a plan. I find it a bit hard to break up projects into manageable tasks, I prefer doing things all in one go.\n\nWhat's important to you and why?\n\n\\-Having a unique set of mind is important as I want to prove to others I know better than them.\n\nWhat are your aspirations?\n\n\\-Archiving something that can change the world, like finding cure for illnesses considered untreatable.\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\-I\u2019m scared of darkness and being useless (or seen as useless), also my own imagination. Loud noises, crowds and getting too much attention makes me uncomfortable. I hate being asked too many questions and orders that make no sense.\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I become more passionate about things, I smile and talk more.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I become a lot more quiet. I will see things negatively and may become critical of others and myself.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\-I can\u2019t say I daydream but I am constantly thinking about things. People sometimes tell me to watch out or ask me if I\u2019m fine. However I am very realistic.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\-First thoughts: Where am I? Why am I here? How to get out? \n\n\\-Then I would start imagining creepy things like a ghost trying to haunt me or I may think what would happen if I was stuck in there forever.\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\-I see both pros and cons when making a decision, I tend to make decisions fast but overthink if it really aligns with what I want, sometimes may change it.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\-I don\u2019t express many extreme emotions and I\u2019m good at controlling them. I think people should learn self control too. However I do value my feelings.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\-I sometimes do this with people I don\u2019t know well. However with my close ones, I almost never do that, I don\u2019t like agreeing to something that isn\u2019t right.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n\\-I often find rules that can be improved but I can\u2019t be bothered so I just follow, and afterwards I may tell my close friends my opinion. However I may break the rules if I don\u2019t see myself getting a considerable result in a friendly game.\n\nWhat is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\n\\-An ideal life in my opinion means work harder when young, rest more when old. Allows alone and time when wanted, but also time for discussing matters with close friends. Strict routines not preferred. Allows listening to more music. Have a good hobby. Generally enjoyable to one\u2019s personal standards but also contributes to the society.\n\nDo I sound more like ENTP/INTP/ISFJ/ESFJ?( or another?)", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.17137657}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.2680829}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -3.6645749}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -5.0415206}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.2974315}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.3458896}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -5.8940177}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.0996375}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.294845}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.8820586}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -6.9423804}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.565912}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.75703}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -7.772302}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.840322}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.065921}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -9.206849}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.342065}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -9.439698}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -9.581483}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.00040242894}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -7.840309}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.354837}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -13.693682}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.861473}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -13.869547}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -15.631783}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -16.067133}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -16.435755}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -16.731104}, {"token": "PJ", "logprob": -16.858418}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -17.00011}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -17.065329}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -17.169996}, {"token": "PO", "logprob": -17.2036}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -17.282309}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -17.32994}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -17.374334}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -17.412622}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -17.454786}]}}
{"submission": "i\u2019m just gonna get straight to the point, i\u2019ve been hyperfixating on mbti for the last couple months (still in a moderately healthy way, i\u2019m in college and doing well but all i can think of in my free time is mbti.) i\u2019ve studied the cognitive functions and their definitions and still can\u2019t decide which one i resonate with. although i\u2019m 90% sure i use extroverted sensing (Se) and introverted intuition (Ni).\n\n\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\ni\u2019m 19, female. i\u2019m an student in college pursuing performing arts as i love having the freedom to express my creativity in many different ways. i\u2019m a third culture kid meaning i grew up in a country different from my native one and i struggle a lot with identity. i spend a lot of time in my head a lot thinking about many different things, from mundane events to the abstract. i love learning about random topics that peak my interest and tend to obsess over them. \n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\ni was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety back in 2021, and i suspect i might have c-ptsd due to some traumatic events that happened in my childhood.\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\ni grew up in a religious household and my parents often forced their ideologies onto me which really irritated me (and frankly was one of the root causes of my traumas) anyway i\u2019ve always disliked going to church for that reason but i just ended up going regularly anyways to maintain the peace between me and my parents\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\ni worked part time at a retail store once and hated it because of how repetitive and boring it was. never again.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\nsomewhat of both but loneliness is kind of a constant feeling for me due to my mental health issues lmfao. i\u2019d also feel refreshed because i enjoy spending time on my own and doing things that make me feel productive.  \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\ni like anything performing arts. i like feeling the adrenaline of being on stage and having the freedom to express my creativity and ideas.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\nvery. i love learning about psychology and i would often watch hundreds of videos a week and read multiple articles and research studies done by professionals. when i was younger i loved exploring videos about the unknown, i was interested in space and geology.\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\ni desire to have structure in my life, so if the time calls for me to be a leader, i wouldnt mind taking on the role. i don\u2019t think i\u2019d be the best at it due to my anxiety but with practice and preparation i think i can be decent. my leadership style would be more on the relaxed side since i want my team members to have freedom in what they want to say and to express their opinions without judgement. i welcome an open discussion and constructive criticism as long as it helps with the vision of the project.  \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\ni would say yes. i practice a lot of facial expressions and body movement in the mirror to see which one looks the most natural and \u201cleast awkward\u201d to the human eye. i\u2019ve been doing this for years now so i can safely say my mind and body coordination is pretty well trained. i do enjoy working with my hands and body, since i am a student in a performing arts course, almost every class i have involves some form of physical activity.\n\n(continued in comments)", "clean_guess": "INFP.", "llm_guess": "INFP. \n\n", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.17699252}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.6233597}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -2.981392}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.7607288}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.3724785}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -5.494219}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -5.894928}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.2810936}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -7.3120537}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.3729935}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.450596}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.236328}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -8.280714}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.267715}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -9.312563}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -9.385254}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.462778}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.592041}, {"token": "Ni", "logprob": -9.782585}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -9.947216}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0019115038}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.488051}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.585947}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.438625}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.604788}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -11.054153}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -11.5826}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.257126}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.459772}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.646891}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -13.184479}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.224899}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -13.629702}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.21977}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -14.261066}, {"token": "_x", "logprob": -14.262016}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -14.383455}, {"token": "PF", "logprob": -14.427805}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -14.465986}, {"token": "_", "logprob": -14.522726}], ".": [{"token": ".", "logprob": -0.693409}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -1.2479591}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -1.6810799}, {"token": ".\n\n", "logprob": -4.375292}, {"token": " \n\n", "logprob": -4.5181866}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -6.162529}, {"token": ",", "logprob": -7.926239}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -7.9958696}, {"token": " (", "logprob": -9.120335}, {"token": ".\n", "logprob": -9.209523}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -9.3393955}, {"token": "\n\n\n", "logprob": -9.593683}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -9.71832}, {"token": "  \n\n", "logprob": -10.510367}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.66542}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -10.718718}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -11.135503}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -11.638215}, {"token": " or", "logprob": -11.738314}, {"token": " based", "logprob": -11.904656}], " \n\n": [{"token": " \n\n", "logprob": -0.021214943}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -4.584953}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -4.753946}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -7.032003}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -7.127483}, {"token": " Some", "logprob": -8.475139}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -8.62346}, {"token": "  \n\n", "logprob": -10.070876}, {"token": " Key", "logprob": -11.438109}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.947839}, {"token": " From", "logprob": -12.024579}, {"token": " In", "logprob": -12.441582}, {"token": " There", "logprob": -12.462193}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -12.670456}, {"token": " Throughout", "logprob": -13.168049}, {"token": "  \n", "logprob": -13.484738}, {"token": " With", "logprob": -13.491618}, {"token": " While", "logprob": -13.647517}, {"token": " Traits", "logprob": -13.785123}, {"token": " Several", "logprob": -13.915552}]}}

{"submission": "Hi! So I know I'm definitely a pessimist. Like I could be absolutely certain that nothing will go wrong unless I somehow die while doing something, but what I say to others is still just giving off a pessimistic prediction of what might happen.\n\nSometimes when I'm really happy with a situation, I start worrying about losing this happy place. Either fearing that I'm not good enough to hold my place in this happiness or just worried that something will come and take away the happy place, I start panicking and making efforts to keep the situation there, but usually end up the reason that the situation goes away and I'm unhappy again. Then when I do actually lose it, I turn into this vitriolic being which worsens the already unhappy matter.\n\nWhen I make a decision, I like to go into research on things, from days to a month. Yet when I do make the decision, I might change my mind. I quite like the feeling of doing extensive research so every crack and nook is made aware of. I feel nervous when I just jump head in without knowing anything.\n\nWhenever I find myself liking something, I start worrying that I might run out, and end up getting this whole stash.

{"submission": "I cant tell if im an ISFJ or an ESFJ. So please help me decide.\n\nSo I\u2019m 15F. I always view myself as this nostalgic person who really values her life. I really value the present because I know that I\u2019ll be able to make fond memories that I\u2019ll always be able to look back on. I view my life in an organised way id say - I have categorised my life in terms of different phases/stages of growth I\u2019ll be undergoing, such as primary (elementary/middle) school years, secondary (high) school years etc (fyi I\u2019m singaporean). I also love to do yearly reviews, because I love to look back on my growth and all the key moments that make the year unique. I always make it a sort of tradition to do yearly reviews. \n\nI also think that I plan my time in a rather rigid fashion. It\u2019s very hard for me to be flexible. So when a problem arises that forces me to change my plans, I get very frustrated. I also heavily determine the best methods to achieve success by looking at my past experiences (successes and failures). One example is when studying for school exams. I try to innovate when I find myself unable to find a proper study technique and want to figure out what works for me. If it helps me get a good grade, I continue with it. If i flunk a test because of it, I scrap that technique and find a new one (more like I watch study videos for tips haha). \n\nAdditionally, I really value what people say. Like, on a near-personal level. I constantly think about how people think of me, and how my actions could affect other people and their impressions of me. I am quite adept at reading body language of a person, and can tell nitty-gritty details about a person and their feelings (e.g just based on observation I can tell who my friends have a crush on). I also am conflict-averse and prefer to keep the peace with my friends. I am trying my best to not be so conflict averse due to past experience, but\u2026yeah, it\u2019s not something that\u2019ll go away that easily lmao.\n\nI also really try to make sense of the world around me. I need myself to explain why the world is the way it is, and I am not comfortable just accepting something just because it exists. An example is how I need to ponder why I/others don\u2019t like a particular book, and why a particular law/rule has been put into place. \n\nI also overthink. A lot. I jump to conclusions SO fast about people because of my insecurities and because of my own observations. I constantly think about \u201cwhat-if\u201ds about my friends - \u201cwhat if they are annoyed at me because I did _____ the other day?\u201d \u201cWhat if this person prefers person A over me?\u201d. Again my past experiences have made me try to control my imagination, but it\u2019s something that just happens sometimes. I also have a track record of being delusional. I remember I was in a pick me girl phase in middle school and constantly finding \u2018evidences\u2019 that a guy i had a crush on liked me.\n\nYeah.

Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n\\- I'm not good at any sports, but I lift and run outside.

What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- I don't like being in leadership positions. I actively try to avoid those. That is because I suck at managing people and at planning team jobs. I prefer working by myself. If I were to be a leader however I believe I would be a control freak that is too afraid to be too hard on his subordinates.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\- I am quite not in touch with my past. I never regret anything I do since I cannot change it and my past barely bothers me. I in fact have bad memory and I tend to forget things easily. I would love to have an opinion on the present but I seldom live in it. I usually prefer dwelling inside my head rather than experiencing the present. But whenever I get back to reality I believe I do enjoy my present somewhat or maybe I actively try to escape it. \n\nHowever, if by present the question meant the \"present\" as for everyone right now, I think that the present is quite alright. It is as regular as it has been any other time in history. People are dying right now because of disease or other people as they have always done. I simply just move forward. \n\nThe future is uncertain. I tend to fantasise about the future. Near future and far future. But in general I have a positive outlook of it. I cannot say anything for sure about it.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\- I usually help others because I want to be seen as useful and because I want people to like me. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\- Yes. I do believe I am a fairly logical person, but emotion can sometimes take lead.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\- I want to be more productive and efficient but don't know how. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\- I like reading books and manhwas. I like manhwas because they are easy to read and digest. Easy dopamine injections. I like reading books because because they help me imagine things that I cannot experience or see in real life. I especially prefer books that use concepts that could in fact happen in real life, for example the hard sci-fi genre. But I also enjoy books with good plot and well written characters with stories that remain in the mind for long.\n\nI also like gaming. It is a fun way to waste time. Grinding for objectives, defeating bosses, amazing stories. They are like books, but interactable. Sometimes I create mods for games if I am able to.\n\nI recently started running. I used to lift but because of my situation I cannot lift, so I decided to run. I don't know why I like running. I find it a good way to develop a different type of muscle and to improve my stamina.\n\nI also love listening to music. So much that I have become dependent on it. I believe it has somewhat reduced my ability to think, but I love finding new music to listen to. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\- I believe I am a visual and kinaesthetic learner. (I don't understand what is meant by learning environment). I prefer classes that involve logic. I don't enjoy memorisation but can do with it, while I am okay with creativity and physical classes.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\- I am not very good at strategise I think. I tend to overall highlight certain targets and wing the process. Sometimes I don't hit those targets so the project may end much more differently than planned at the start. \n\nSome other times, when I like the project, I tend to imagine it and then work towards achieving it. Normally by myself, as I struggle to share my vision to others and have them follow it.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n\\- I want to grow up as a person. I have been told I am still immature and I realised that I am still immature, so I want to become a mature person. Professionally I want to be successful and knowledgeable. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\- I am afraid of snakes lmao. I am also scared of going in trouble with the law and have my options in life stolen. I want to be able to do whatever. \n\nI am uncomfortable in highly emotional atmospheres, especially with people I am not close with. I am also uncomfortable with people I do not like and with people that do not like me and with people I do not know, as I am quite awkward socially. \n\nI don't hate anything in particular because everything has a good and a bad side. But there are a couple of things. For example, I don't like whenever people act in certain destructive/obstructive/annoying ways to get what they want. Especially when there could be better ways of achieving them without bothering others. For example, certain types protesters, like the ones that block roads. Sure, I understand where they come from, but the way they go about protesting barely illicits any positive sentiment towards their ideals. Want to stop oil? Ok, but don't stop my car, I'm tired and trying to go home. \n\nI also hate sexual assault in particular actually. I hate it. Despicable. No good reason behind it and just makes the world worse for everyone.\n\nI also strongly dislike people with very strong views on certain topics. They just annoy me a lot. I like to question them and try to piss them off by trying to break their arguments down. Not just with people that I don't agree with, but with people that I agree with sometimes too. Though it's rare, because I don't want to be hated too much.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- No idea. I think it's a state where I am continuously content and when my life is in order. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- When everything is wrong and when there is some kind of huge decision with huge implications behind any path I could take. Basically, when I feel trapped.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\- I want to be attached to reality, but I daydream often. I think about things that obsess me and think about random things that I see. I think my daydreaming is affected by whenever I force myself back to reality for a little. I barely pay attention to what's around me because it bores me quickly. Sometimes I completely forget about my surroundings or just depersonalise and feel like I am in a videogame. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\- I think I would think about how exciting it is to be in such a condition. Then I would think about some random thought and obsess over it. But I would also probably turn crazy soon enough.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\- It takes a long time if I am by myself. I try to wait as much as possible before taking a decision. And when I do and can't go back I just live with it. If I can change my mind and overturn the decision I could but I learned that it would lead to me just changing my mind over and over, so I try to keep my decision as much as possible and limit myself to two changes of mind, though they take a long time regardless as I just weight pros and cons and how others may be impacted. Though funnily enough I sometimes know the answer deep inside, and sometimes I choose not to listen to it and listen to my pros and cons that include what other people instead.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\- I don't know. I am rarely sad but can feel like that deeply even more rarely. I've only cried a few times alone. In my daily life, emotions don't play too much of a role. Maybe frustration and extreme irrational anger rarely. I am normally neutral or content. So I would say that emotions don't play much of a role.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\- Yes. All the time. I go along with what they say and bring up points to support their arguments. But sometimes I cannot stand the bullcrap I let them say  or just feel bold so I speak up and tell them why they are wrong or bring contrasting viewpoints. Normally I just let people speak because I don't want to be hated or disliked. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\n\\- Yes, especially when I know I can get away with it and when it makes sense to break them. I do believe authority should be challenged sometimes. It cannot be denied that some rules and laws are there for a reason and therefore should be challenged. Though I admit I do break rules often, even when I see the reason why they were set in the first place - I usually think it's no big deal and that I can gain from them.\n\nFrom different tests I've done over time, I usually got ENTP, followed by INTP. I also relate to ENFP.\n\nSo what the hell am I? I can't stop coming up with reasons why I am not either and tests aren't accurate. Or maybe I am in denial and know the answer already, but what outside confirmation. Or maybe my knowledge of the functions isn't deep enough. Help me please.\n\nAlso, sorry for long post.

{"submission": "So I recently dived into theory after years of thinking I'm isfp, turned out I didn't know wtf fi is actually about lol, I don't really use it as well as te.   \nNarrowed it down to xstp but that's where I got stuck. I'm honestly trying but I'm probably not introspective enough to understand if I'm ti or se dom, so I decided to hit it from the back and try to pinpoint my inf function. Leaning towards inf ni but would appreciate y'all guys help.   \nSo I'll try to give examples of how my fe and ni work, if something irrelevant comes up in the meantime - sorry, I'm still trying to figure it all out and may mix in things that aren't really connected to these functions. Here goes.   \nFe: I'd say I'm pretty good at the social game, and the fact that I've always been well liked in every group is probably proof enough. I did kind of lack in this department in middle school, noticed that and decided to change it, started observing other people, especially the popular types, and learnt mimicing their actions and mannerisms.   \nI have a broad bank of performative emotions, know when to smile, laugh, what facial expression suits the situation, what to say and how to react, which set of body language to use in order to make a certain impression, which persona to put on to be favoured and liked in a certain group. I learnt all that pretty quickly and was one of the popular girls at HS, got along great with people from my group at uni, was well liked by all of my colleagues at my previous workplace; now I teach teens and they love me too. I never took on leadership roles but was still one of the most high standing and respected members in a group.   \nI really like playing these social games, feeling like I belong, being part of a clique, all that stuff. I feel like an excited kid about to play a new game, it's stimulating for some reason. It does tire me out a bit but I wouldn't call it that stressful.   \nNow that I think about it it kinda sounds like I'm constantly faking it all and am actually dead inside, but not really - I do feel stuff, I do actually like some people, but I'm generally content with liking them in silence, without letting them know about it. But people don't know unless you tell or show them, duh. That was kinda my problem in middle school. My classmates thought I hated them when I actually didn't, I just kinda treated them like npc's and didn't talk to them much lmao. Looking back at myself now I completely understand their frustration, but past me was genuinely surprised and didn't know what was wrong.   \nI have insane loyalty and love for my friends, but sometimes when too much discontent and stress from a relationship pile up, it's like a switch goes off and I start feeling cold and apathetic towards them. I get passive aggressive, instigate conflict to prepare a stage for myself to vent out all of my frustrations with our relationship. I lowkey love conflict, people are most honest when they're angry, fighting lets issues get aired and resolved much quicker compared to a calm and friendly approach.  \nAt times I start projecting my own discontent with people onto them, saying stuff like 'I know y'all actually hate me and secretly think I'm an awful person blahblah', even though I'm aware that it's actually me who harbors animosity here, but I kinda use this strategy as a leeway to let my pals know that they haven't been a good friend lately, treating me worse than they should.   \nNi: that's going to be hard af to write because Ni is so abstract and ephemeral it's insane. I've read tons of info about it and still don't really understand wtf it is. Hoping to at least get a couple of paragraphs out lmao.   \nI don't think about the future, at all. It's very stressful and scary. My mother is all about setting and reaching goals, constantly preaching about how important it is and how results are all that matter. I haven't set a single goal in my life, I don't have an idea of where I'll be in several years, or even a year. I just do stuff and go with the flow, hoping life will take me somewhere nice. It's not that I don't achieve anything, I do, but I'm just always focused on the present moment - I want to take up this hobby, I like doing it, cool, I'm doing it. And suddenly I've been enjoying doing it for so long that I got good at it. Yay! But getting good at it was never a goal in my mind. I just kept doing it because I liked it.   \nI never envision what will be. It's all white fog, even short term like a couple of months. And that's why I never plan ahead in anything. Improvisation has lowkey carried me through life, and pretty successfully might I say.   \nI did try to envision how I or my life will be in the future a couple of times, but it never turned out to be true lol. The visions were either too abstract or simply too hard to achieve. And I never took any steps to reach that imaginary future. Just put together a couple of ideas and called it a day lmao. No wonder nothing came true.   \nBut I do get hunches and gut feelings. At some point I just suddenly know if something is going to happen or be a certain way like right now. I know when I'll get lucky rolling for a new ssr in a gacha game. I know something bad will happen soon (I was once on a train crossing a bridge, felt a weird adrenaline rush like sum dangerous was about to happen, a couple of hours after the bridge collapsed). And vice versa, when things look dire and everyone's scared out of their mind, I'm just there like \ud83d\ude00 because I know everything's going to be fine, and it does turn out fine. It's just some kind of a subconscious short-term psychic ability.   \nAnd one more thing, I read an article about how inf Ni works and it described something I experienced to a t. Last year I was working a horrible secretarial job that was so boring, monotonous and unstimulating that it made me hella depressed. My Se was so unfulfilled that I fell into a mental pit, a crying miserable mess. And that's when I went full on wannabe philosophy guru, constantly thinking about how empty life actually is in the grand scheme of things, how useless and hopeless human existence is, that nothing really mattered, that my life was pointless and the future would be even worse, nothing would get better and I'll suffer forever and ever and ever. And so on. The author of the article I read described it as 'falling into unhealthy Ni' for inf Ni users, and I felt that big time. One of the worst meltdowns I've ever experienced.   \nSo there we have it, I tried to cover as much info about myself concerning fe and ni as possible, if you read all that, thank you haha.

{"submission": " For context, I've been typed as an ISTP or INTP and I'm not sure if i am any of them or something else. What do you guys think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\n\\- Nope, nothing.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n\\- I don't have a job, however, I've been told I'd be a good lawyer or English/history teacher.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\- Well it depends. I love spending time alone, but i wanna do stuff while I'm alone, sitting down bores me to death and i feel wasted if i don't do anything on the weekend. I always need to be doing something and i prefer to do it on my own.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n\\- Outdoors for sure, I am good at sports (Netball, swimming and badminton) however, my communication skills with my teammates is pretty bad.  I like going out a lot, even if it's just to a simple place i just feel better outside than inside. I do enjoy some indoor activities and usually they're more of a 'creative' type.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\-  I'm very curious, sometimes my curiosity gets to me and i start asking unthoughtful questions. I get a lot of thoughts and try to picture a certain situation and all the possibilities that could answer my curiosity. Usually I'm curious about life, just meaning of certain things that fascinate me. Maybe wonder what's going on in peoples heads and how it all works. I like observing my surroundings for more answers to my questions and sometimes i get those answers i seek for.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- I've done some leadership stuff in the past, but i feel like I'm way too independent. It's hard to rely on others and i tend to explode if someone isn't doing something properly. Sometimes i even take over their jobs if it starts to bother me.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n\\- Maybe my mind is more organized than my surroundings. I'm able to make a plan in my head in a second and follow it, get into action quickly. I do like practical work a lot more than theory. I tend to be ready to do any with my hands, to experience anything new.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\- I am quite artistic. My art is usually landscapes of certain memories in the back of my head. Drawing buildings and what not. I try to keep it realistic. Abstract art isn't really my thing though.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI hate the past and can't deal with it, I'm more focused on what is happening now. I like the future to be unknown and let myself go with the flow of life.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\- Depends on the person. If its someone i don't speak to then i wont help them. But if they're a friend i'll help them out. Sometimes i get a little annoyed because they need help with things than can be easily done but it's not too much of a bad thing.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\- Yes, i live in a household where logic isn't used too often when making decisions and it bothers me when for certain decisions they don't use logic.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\- I like to be productive, i dont like to lie around and do nothing.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\-if we're doing a task then i probably would without noticing.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\- Playing guitar, video games, taking walks in the morning, reading books, drawing, painting, writing, and sports (the ones i stated before). I like these because some are relaxing and some make me think a lot.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\- So subjects i enjoy to begin with are maths, pdhpe and visual arts. I struggle learning in a loud atmosphere or even when learning in groups. I prefer doing things on my own. The practical side of pdhpe and art is what i enjoy most about them. I like maths for the use of reason. Like it's methods and equations and how one equals to another.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\- Improvise for sure- I know i'm able to finish something on time so i just do it last second and quickly too.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n\\- Just live a normal successful life, maybe even answer a few more questions that keep me up at night but other than that just a normal lifestyle.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\- Fights, especially unnecessary ones. I feel uncomfortable with compliments and physical touch. I just don't know how to react to it or how to respond to it.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- I would just be in a good mood for some times, joke around sometimes. But usually i'm just neutral.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- i start putting pressure on myself.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\- i don't day dream often, i used to but its been a year since all the day dreaming stuff. I pay attention to what I'm focusing on only. Sometimes my mind is just blank and i think of nothing for hours.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\- Why i'm here, how i ended up here, maybe think about what is possible to do now.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\- I can be indecisive, especially with big decisions. i try to think of what could happen if i do \"this or that\" and then choose the best outcome. Sometimes my decisions change. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\- I try to think about what i'm feeling. Just try to figure out this feeling before i fully process it in my head. Emotions are important in a way but as i grew older i haven't really been expressing them that often.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\- Nope, i have strong opinions. I dont agree with anyone to make them happy i just say what i believe in. It also keeps the conversations interesting.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\n\\- YES, i have broken so much rules that it's always expected of me to do something crazy or just out of the blue. Well challenging authorities is a big step but it really depends on what rule i'm breaking. If im not doing anything illegal then i'd find it funny to challenge people to keep up with my behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats it for now. If anyone has any questions im glad to answer them. I've been having a hard time figuring my mbti so i'll be glad if someone helps me out.

{"submission": "I went to elementary school with she and her siblings (she has two sisters, both are a bit older.) Her mother is (well, I suppose was) actually a photographer, and I remember that she was actually once in a magazine because of it. Her mother is a housewife, and has been one since the girls were all little. \n\nI remember that I was actually in an engineering (STEM, to be a bit more specific) program with her in elementary school - I would have been in fifth-grade, and she would have been in fourth-grade. Children who were considered to be good at math were \u201cchosen\u201d to be apart of the program. I remember, even years later (though I suppose that my memory isn\u2019t *that* bad) that I did not like this girl. She struck me as being spoiled, and bratty - I recall that her mother was actually once at one of the meetings, and that she seemed to be whining to her mother about something. I remember that she just seemed a bit self-centered, like one of those kids who complains about things a lot (I actually suspect that she was her mother\u2019s favorite child between the three - I think that her mother is an ExFJ, and if you glance through her mom\u2019s old Flickr account, you\u2019ll notice that there are more pictures of this girl than there are her sisters.) I don\u2019t remember her as having been \u201cdumb,\u201d though. She just seemed chatty (didn\u2019t talk to me really directly, or at least I don\u2019t think she did) and like she had a lot of energy. This is actually a video of her from a long time ago if you\u2019d like to know what she was like: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9uf8bBeBY \n\nI remember that she did or does follow the activist account for an organization I had been part of. \n\nI have the impression that she has \u201ccalmed down\u201d a lot over the years - she has ended up going to the same high school as her two older sisters instead of choosing one that her friends would have attended. I have the impression that if I met her now, she wouldn\u2019t be as loud and annoying. She is quite thin, and does not strike me as being particularly likely to have a child (she has not done or said anything on social media that would indicate that she is opposed to the idea of having one, but I just feel as though her second older sister - the one who is the middle child - is more likely to have a baby years down the line than she is.) She bakes sometimes, even though her mom is a housewife, and seemingly learned to when she was in middle school. I remember that when I followed her old Instagram account, there was a picture of her where she looked nervous and was covering her mouth somewhat self consciously (she wore braces at one point so perhaps someone teased her about her teeth.) \n\nShe started going by \u201cLiz\u201d (which is a nickname for her real name, \u201cElizabeth\u201d) instead of \u201cAnne\u201d at some point in either middle school or ninth grade. I remember that this surprised me when I found out about it, since she grew up being called \u201cAnne\u201d (which is really her middle name) and I had just never expected she\u2019d change her preferred name like that.

If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?  \\*\\*I naturally had interest in insects, plants, and geometric group theory.

What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? \\*\\*I am unsure of the extent of my curiosity. I have more conceptual ideas than I can execute usually. For example, while zoning out, I would come up with a proof, but later forget or would be too preoccupied to complete or finalize.\\*\\*\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? \\*\\* In any setting, I am terrible with group work. Either I will be in control of the whole thing or I will be doing it by myself. Literally, there will be an coup d'etat if I was an leader.\\*\\*\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy         \n\\*\\* I am terrible with working with my hands.

How do you deal with them? \\*\\*This question is too complicated and will require additional 30 pages, therefore I will not answer for the sake of my sanity. \\*\\*\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? \\*\\*If it was doing something mischievous, such as helping someone troll online or in real life, I would do it. Of course, I would weight the pros (personal satisfaction) and cons (lowered social status/broken relationship).\\*\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? \\*\\*Naturally, I am manipulative, but it is moslty used for friendliness. Question: At what extent is it controlling? The person I am trying to manipulate has decided to think that way. It was their decision to respond that way to my input. Haha, jk....\\*\\*\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? \\*\\*When learning new concepts, the first question I ask is \"why\" and \"how.\" Looking up multiple different proofs, and the proofs of the theorem in the proof.  After that phrase of in-depth searching of the concept, I go onto it's applications both theoretical and physical.\\*\\*\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? \\*\\*Start by planning and breaking up tasks, but end up not following them. At the last minute, I wing my projects and improvise as I go.\\*\\*\n* What are your aspirations? \\*\\* I wanted to make a mark in history when I was younger like John Nash. Now, I just want to be healthy.\\*\\*\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like? \\*\\*Weirdly, when I am mentally in the trenches, I am very very tidy. I find myself cleaning everything up. Mentally sharp.\\*\\*\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? \\*\\*Uhhh, for how long? If there is nothing for me to do, can I burn calories?? Will I be wearing clothes? Will someone moniter me?\\*\\*\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? \\*\\* \n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? \\*\\*I have learned to stay silent. I don't show agreement or disagreement. I can't agree to an false conclusion. I usually end up debating sometimes.\\*\\*\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you? \\*\\*I used to be in detention almost daily during my teen years for talking or making kids laugh....I didn't care about rules. I think authority should be challenged if they are incapable.

{"submission": "Yes, based on the title, I\u2019m debating between ENTP and ISFJ. I can\u2019t tell at all. I have actually made a post regarding my type under this subreddit (I think some of y\u2019all will know lmao). But let me give a better description to finalise my decision once and for all. I\u2019ll read up more about the functions on my own afterwards too, but now my exams are coming up, so naturally I don\u2019t have the time to read up on everything, and I just want to clear this up before I get too distracted. So pls bear with me \ud83d\ude4f sorry for annoying anyone; I must look really desperate rn :((\n\n1) I am 15F. Singaporean\n\n2) dk if this is relevant - Brought up in a family with parents who are very loving, but very overprotective (I still love them dearly tho, besides I see where they come from when they act that way). \n\n3) Had a struggle finding ways to fit in when I was younger. Through past experience, and by picking up social cues, I learnt how to socialise. Am still social awkward tho to an extent\n\n4) My key traits, I feel, are diligent, nurturing, thoughtful and reflective. I view myself as diligent (tho it may not link to typology, because every type can be diligent ofc) because I never, EVER back down even after a failure. For instance, when I fail a school subject, I\u2019ll feel absolutely horrible, but I am not prone to giving up. I almost always find ways and alternatives to improve. My failures genuinely make me mad, and that anger really motivates me to do better. I am nurturing because 1), people have constantly described me as welcoming, kind, empathetic and caring. And 2), I realise how fast people tend to open up to me. And I am proud to say that I am able to cheer people up real fast. I\u2019d call myself thoughtful because, well, partially because of the way I\u2019m writing this post. But also because I constantly try to think about my mindset, as well as the world around me as a whole. My teacher once told me that she admired how broadly I think and how fast I am able to read between the lines and build connections. I\u2019d say it\u2019s true to a degree. I can analyse the people around me (oftentimes being able to correctly guess my peers\u2019 relationships with others), the world\u2019s different problems as well (? Tho i think I\u2019m getting worse at it lmao) as how people think differently (esp compared to me). I can even vividly remember my mindset when I was a kid. \n\n5) I\u2019m quite nostalgic. I love reminiscing abt my past memories. I even made it a Tradition to review my year annually to celebrate my growth and pick apart what was unique about that year. Very tiring sometimes, but well, it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been doing for a long time. So I\u2019d never back out from a tradition that means so much to me. \n\n6) when I\u2019m listening to others\u2019 problems, while I definitely try my best to make them feel better first, the way I approach their problems is by tackling the issue first before giving them emotional comfort. I try to understand WHY they\u2019re feeling that way to begin with. Then I try to identify their stressors. Then I try my best to think about how they\u2019d feel because of these stressors, esp after knowing how they\u2019re like. THEN I give advice based on my own insight and experience. I never like to be blunt because ik it\u2019ll make them feel worse. But I\u2019ve learnt that being honest while being empathetic is better. I still am prone to sugar-coating facts, though. \n\n7) Time to talk about my flaws. Im very stubborn. Like, REALLY stubborn. I dont Like to change myself unless I feel the need to do so. If someone criticises me, I either ignore them or take it really personally. And another reason why I\u2019m stubborn is because I hate it when someone comments about my schedule or way of living my life. That has happened a lot and I get very annoyed. It\u2019s even worse if that person doesn\u2019t even have a valid reason for saying that. I prefer determining myself if I have to change my habits than have other people tell me what to do. I am also very conflict averse. I hate confronting people, I hate BEING confronted, I hate just seeing a heated argument. I want things to be kept peaceful among people. That has unfortunately led to me having many miscomms with my ex-friends. I am also incapable of making long-term decisions. I guess it\u2019s normal for a 15y/o, but like\u2026it\u2019s concerning for me. An example is when i really wanted to get into a particular school after graduating from secondary school. We had the option to apply early to schools of our choice, so that was what I did. But literally 2 weeks after submitting my application, I was like, \u201cwait. What if this school doesn\u2019t suit me? What if another school suits me?\u201d Andddd I ended up revoking my application. Sooo yeah. Oh, and I\u2019m rather irrational at times. I Jump to conclusions way too fast about my friends due to my insecurities and paranoia. Like \u201cwhat if my best friend prefers friend A over me?\u201d It has also led to a few fallen friendships.\n\n8) when I grow up, I want to live a life that I will thoroughly enjoy. I want to be around my loved ones and friends (or if i get married, my partner ). I want to get into my desired career path (communications/social sciences :D). I want to explore a few jobs in that field, then settle into one I feel is most fruitful. I want to understand everyone and how various forms of media impact others. I just want to live a life I can reminisce about. \n\nOnce again, I sincerely apologise if I annoy anyone here. I might look really desperate rn. The reason why I\u2019m posting this again is because, while I was convinced for a while that I might be an ENTP, it still didn\u2019t really make sense to me how my descriptions in my previous post = Ne. Plus my descriptions were admittedly awful. However with my limited knowledge of functions, there\u2019s still a possibility that I\u2019m an ENTP.

{"submission": "I am an eighteen year old woman. I will note that I am perhaps somewhat shallow deep down inside - I cried (yes, cried\u2026 I have been especially depressed lately, though) because today I realized, even though I\u2019d perhaps started to get my hopes up a bit on Tuesday, that the conventionally attractive guy who I tend to check in on (I even gave him my number on Tuesday just to ensure he could text someone if he needs help) will not be asking me out. I concluded this based in part on his expression when I asked him if he\u2019d like to take a picture of what we did before he came to class (he always comes in late) - it\u2019s hard to explain, but it was really a combination of his body language/expression throughout class (the vibes I was getting) and the fact that he chose to sit behind me even though the seat right next to me was open which led me to conclude that he won\u2019t be asking me out. I figure, even though I\u2019m not positive, that he either suspects or \u201cknows\u201d (I think he\u2019s an ISTP) that I\u2019m attracted to him/have a crush on him, once again just based off vibes - but everything he did today, if I am to analyze his behavior, actually leads me to believe that there is no real attraction on his part/no real plan to ask me out. On Tuesday I was sort-of getting different vibes, but I still believe anyhow that his behavior today means that he won\u2019t be asking me out. \n\nWhen I was walking home (and I walk home everyday from college, in part because I am from a poor family and we really do need to save as much money as we can) I cried a bit because I am someone who has grown up feeling very insecure about my physical appearance (I am a black woman and am perhaps slightly below average facially. I\u2019m conscious of the fact that this has emphasized because of where I live/who I live around.) I remember that I just genuinely felt really bad, because I feel like no one will ever properly want me (I also felt silly because I know deep down inside that I am too busy with both school and my part-time job to really be able to handle having a boyfriend right now. I know that if I do get into another relationship, it will likely fail since I have low self esteem and need to take care of my mental health.) I was thinking about how deep down inside, even though I do think I want to marry and have a child, I am worried that I will never find a man who will stay with me and truly care for me (I actually have a part-time job wherein I work with children.) I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and don\u2019t come from a \u201cgood home.\u201d \n\nMy coworker recently described me as being \u201cdiplomatic,\u201d \u201csweet,\u201d and \u201cgood at communicating.\u201d \n\nThese are my social media accounts (my book review account, and my old Archive of Our Own account - I actually started on fanfiction.net when I was still in elementary school, if you can believe it); https://instagram.com/bookreviewsbynairobi?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== and https://archiveofourown.org/works/41223696 \n\nI do tend to \u201cnotice\u201d physical details, and the like. I will note that I tend to have an idea of where I think someone else is looks wise (whether they are average, slightly below it, or slightly above it.) I\u2019ve realized that I don\u2019t trust most people (in part due to bad personal experiences with people,) and that I can actually be quite judgmental about the appearances of other people, even though I don\u2019t *think* I treat anyone differently because of it. \n\nI tend to stress a lot over what will happen the upcoming day, like just over small things. I think this is probably a factor in me always looking as tired as I do. I have had a lot of trouble dealing with the fact that things are so different now more recently.

However, looking back on it now, I can see that all of the things he\u2019s done for me were attempts at comforting me and trying to help me become a part of the group as a result of him being extremely sensitive to the predicaments of my debilitating neurological impairments.\n\nI was considering that his developed Ni could\u2019ve been due to him being an obvious enneagram 3. But I honestly wouldn\u2019t know the difference between ESTP and ENFJ 3s either when I think about it in the context of this guy. All I know is he really wanted to be my friend and would constantly push me to throw parties that everyone in the class would like and playfully tease me about how no one would wanna hang out at the library or at a party with no alcohol, kebab pizza (I was and still am a proud vegetarian), or girls they can bring along. So that\u2019s what made me think Se dom back then.\n\nAnd the more obvious ENFJs in my class just always seemed way more mature and serious than he was, but it was probably due to him having a to 7 fix in his tritype compared the others. He was one of the two fuckboys at my table that would toss my pens in the air and snatch my notebook from me when I was busy studying in order to pay attention to him.\n\nExcept rather than trying to contradict and indoctrinate my worldview with a more cynical perspective, he usually would push and tease me in a much more gentle manner with a soft smile on his face compared to his fellow fuckboys. I did that even more than he did and he loved how straightforward and honest I was, but also desperately wanted me to stop at some point because he felt like I was just shooting myself in the foot and got extremely tired of holding back his own life for that.\n\nI also always thought that he was an obvious ESTP since he mostly thought about materialistic things (golfing, his status in society, appearance) and always enjoyed living in the present moment (partying, being shamelessly kinky/horny) whilst getting frustrated at me for overthinking things instead of taking action. He also would devote a significant amount of our arguments to bluntly criticising how I chose to present myself to others through immensely detailed similes, as though implying that my behaviour was so 'ugly and nasty' that it reminded him of a spooky spider that creeps and crawls underneath one\u2019s desk, and that I\u2019d never succeed in life acting like that. On the other hand, during those arguments, he\u2019d also make these ominous predictions about my future that ended up being eerily accurate to how my life ended up turning out, which I would acknowledge in the back of my head but was too delusional in my image to confront head-on. This makes me consider that his Ni is higher in his function stack than I was initially led to believe, especially when one takes into account that he was 16-19 years old when he had these premonitions about me. \n\nFor further context about these 'premonitions', he often gave me the benefit of the doubt compared to other guys of his typical teenage boy archetype whenever I was overwhelmed and delusional because he figured that I simply suffered from some type of mental disorder, and that\u2019s why I was lashing out or displaying inappropriate behaviour. So as a result, he seemed to spend a lot of time with me, prying into my life to find out what kind of things I liked to seem like less of a threat and deweaponise things with me in general. By the end of year 9, he went on a massive tangent about how everything I was doing was ugly, stupid, and nasty and that people would just treat me like a joke once we went into our first year of high school. So for the first two years of high school, I took his advice and got my act together, but the problem was that I was hanging around with the wrong kinds of people who would romanticise depression and shit, and they often criticised me for seeming pretty normie compared to them, so I eventually fell back to my old habits, and that ended up ruining my life, just like he predicted.\n\nI went back to him at 18 hoping to rekindle our connection, and he was very happy and enthusiastic to do so until he felt like I was going to lead him into a position where he\u2019d feel my therapist. So he expressed things like - \"You\u2019ll never get a job with that mental disorder to bear\" -, but also how he wanted me to know that everything was going to be okay before exiting my life forever.\n\nBut idk, what do you guys think of this?\n\nP.S. \u301c I\u2019m sooo sure he was enneagram 3 and had 378 as his tritype.", "clean_guess": "ENFJ", "llm_guess": "ENFJ", "logprobs": {"EN": [{"token": "EN", "logprob": -0.1520582}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -2.3647523}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -4.667645}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -4.803578}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -4.9436936}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -4.992108}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -5.8043275}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.9373384}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -6.4161477}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.703057}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.055943}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -7.2102513}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.4260716}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -7.599381}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -7.6508203}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.74025}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -7.796431}, {"token": " ES", "logprob": -7.8271737}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -8.282849}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.56977}], "F": [{"token": "F", "logprob": -0.078089885}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -2.6008408}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.7095327}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -8.833402}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -9.177091}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -9.549794}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.71872}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.279155}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -11.380654}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.610126}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -12.169595}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -12.69847}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -12.735299}, {"token": "SP", "logprob": -13.442388}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -14.128521}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -14.301579}, {"token": "EP", "logprob": -14.596467}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -14.675003}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.719378}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -14.976618}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -3.0545007e-06}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.911778}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -13.956105}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -15.874602}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -15.883371}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -16.134148}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -16.152224}, {"token": "JI", "logprob": -16.1794}, {"token": "JS", "logprob": -16.527382}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.72506}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -16.737993}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -16.805752}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -17.018066}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -17.331465}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -17.363878}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -17.540977}, {"token": "PE", "logprob": -17.93966}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -18.249668}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -18.312237}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -18.318783}]}}
{"submission": "Question: do you believe in friendship between guys and girls?\n\nMy answer: not really.. I mean physically is can exist because if two people decide to not to do something else then it can exist on a superficial level (and only superficial, so without hanging out, opening emotionally, talking for fun..) which in 90% of cases it is dictated by the social positions in which one finds oneself, for example two work colleagues or boss\u2013employee dynamic. (Then to be totally honest if you'd like to fuck a coworker it's always possible but it goes against normal social rules in many cases lol, no one likes that).\nOn the other side on a mental level it cannot exist, there is always (in any case) someone who is attracted to the other person, maybe not everyday, maybe not totally in a conscious way, but even those minutes where you think about the other person in that way then it doesn't count as a real friendship.\nJust by thinking abt it, how weird would it be if a mom says to her family before leaving home: 'I'm hanging out with my male friend, bye byee' I mean she could say at the limit 'coworker' but if she says friend and means exactly 'friend' then the family would be angry asf and me and you would be laughing.\n\nBTW this is only my opinion, if you want to talk about it I'm truly opened to new ideas/opinions.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.1392041}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -3.1313648}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.4767418}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -3.9049416}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.1264286}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -4.8083572}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.7067604}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.277811}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.4423275}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -7.063118}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.533869}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.714363}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.8307056}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.848978}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.912941}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -8.112629}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.730228}, {"token": " ENT", "logprob": -9.490835}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.631266}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -9.646589}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.10395295}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -2.3153749}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.457742}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -14.691365}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.707961}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -15.315434}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -15.582744}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -16.893343}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -16.931461}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -17.02103}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -17.13787}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -17.15423}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -17.294056}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -17.651812}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -17.73943}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -17.886421}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -17.910652}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -17.962055}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -17.994541}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -18.227402}]}}
{"submission": "Guys can you please help me type myself. I have recently taken tests for various type of personality test among with i got-\nFor MBTI-\nENTJ, ESTJ and ESFJ\nFor enneagram-\nEnneagram 3\n\nEmotions -\nMaybe my perceptions of ESTJ are too different for me to believe i am an ESTJ(i get ESTJ most recently). I always thought i was an ESFJ or let's say an F for a long time since i tend to be very empathetic and i tend to be very emotional. But lately after seeing and reading about personality types I have been more accepting of me being a T and not an F due to me being very rational and i keep my emotions and feelings aside when making decisions (majority of the time).\n\nJudging 'xxxJ' -\nI am pretty sure I am a J because I tend to be very systematic and I would list down all the things I would be doing for the day or even the following week with some future plans for years ahead as well. Also I am a perfectionist, I like things to be kept in place, I might not be as hard working as other perfectionist but most of the time I am. Let's say my house is in a mess and I don't feel like cleaning the whole day, I will still clean before I go to bed because I cannot rest well until and unless I am neat and clean. And yes you could say I am a clean freak. Once I clean, it has to be perfectly clean, I don't do so-so cleanings. (These are stuffs I read online for a j, basically planning and also my friends agree I am too much of a J and could never be a P \ud83d\udc80\n\nSensing 'xSxx' -\nAs for Sensing I'm not quite sure myself. Even though I read lots of meanings for the 'S, sensing' I can never really come to a conclusion as to what it means, if you've already read this far please tell me what sensing is I am at a lost. I did see something that goes like 'learning from past and thinking about really and not what if' I'm not too sure so don't come at me for it. But yes I will say from this meaning that I got. I learn from past experience. If I come across any problems and I have experience a similar situation or anyone I know have experienced a similar situation, I take action from the way I/they did. Let's say, a friend brought some game from an online store and had bad experience with the thing he/she brought, I would consider buying a different one as the one they brought wasn't to their satisfaction. (And so far another trait of mine is I always make an example whenever I explain something. And always the simplest example possible). \nIf I happen to come across a situation I have never heard of or known of, I would first check online if anyone has gone through it, or course I would check different articles and videos for it and decide what I would do but trust me in the process I think of the worst case possible and try and find a result for that. Let's say I had done something bad and I got caught from it, but my parents are not aware of it, I will think of a solution to where my parents have found out about it and they are now scolding me for it, by the end if I am at a very high disadvantage, I will just accept my fate (although I solve these situations without the \"if\"s I thought of)\n\nWords -\nI am very blunt with words. If a person is not nice and is acting very selfish/proud or an egoistic person, I don't mind crushing them. Like literally, I have come across lots of people like this and I have talked to them in such a way they get offended to the max. I am very short tempered but I am a very patient person, internally. I can put up with people for weeks and if something really ticks me off I scold them as hard as I can, I don't filter my words at all. And also I read people easily, their expressions, their choice of words and everything I can see through them, if that's the right word. I feel happy when I can see their offended expression when they triggered me. I don't do this to everyone though. Just to those that are veeeeeeeery annoying. I usually filter my words for people I really like, in fact I am quite the people pleaser, I keep everyone happy and I am not hesitant to do any tasks another person is required to do as long as they need help. But never for lazy people.\n\nI have very short attention span -\nThis does not happen for every situation but does alot when people are talking to me, if it's about business and work related, it haaardly happen, or so far I think it has not happened at all. But when chit chatting, if many people are talking to me(I have quite the amount of friends. As extrovert as I can be I feel happy when I interact with lots of friends), I tend to forget what I was saying or even forget when friends ask me something. \n\nAnd I started a job recently and I am very strict with work, work is work personal matter is personal matter. And also I love cleaning alot but I don't do things very fast but when I do it's extremely clean, I can bet on that. And yes 1 more thing, I hate it when you have a fight with others about a certain stuffs and they bring out their ultimate weapon \"you don't care about me\" shit. Like gurl/dude we're talking about practical stuffs and not your stupid emotions. Speaking from experience. And I recently had a fight with my colleague because he was slacking off on his work and he went \"you never asked about my feelings\" this one is a bit different, he has some family problems and he must have had bad news about it but my point is work is work. I don't judge when he's on the phone during working hours as long as there is no work. But if work is there he could just complete it you know, no need to drag his personal stuffs in workplace. Anddd he's an old dude who have had his own company and is on break due to some problems and I am just a kid who barely have 1 month experience  on the real adult's work. Dude why not get your experience to be seen in his work life!! Anyways I am going off topic.

At the same time i was a little afraid of new people, and I went through some family issues that made me feel insecure, that was the time when I went into videogames and spent around 5 hours a day on them, and I oftentimes tried to include people but they wouldn\u2019t (obviously) keep it going with me.\n\nMiddle School \n\nAfter that, I got into middle school, here, I think it was one of the best times of my life because I discovered and got into music, I started playing piano because a friend of mine like to play piano and we both enjoyed Coldplay songs and I wanted to play piano because he did, but surprisingly music became a recurrent part of my life, in that same years, I formed a band and had my first gig at the graduation ceremony at the same time, I think I met my best friends at the time.\n\nHigh School I\n\nThen I got into high school and first, let\u2019s See A was a better student, academically talking, because I never really like to go to school and I found classes to be boring not to say about homework because I always did procrastinate and preferred to do the stuff I wanted to because it was funnier. All of that resulted added to the fact that started skipping classes school, which made me finish it in five years instead of three, but anyway, when I entered high school for the second time more prepared because I had felt that I had hit rock bottom.\n\nHigh School II\n\nOn that second time, I was at academically other student, especially in online classes, because I found that I was more of a self learning person and at the same time, I dated a girl that was like my canon event because I went through some heavy stuff with her but in the end we broke up. Then pandemic was over and it was time to socialise. It was nice :) I made lots of friends all throughout my school and joined another band, we had three gigs and honestly high school was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had. I mainly focused on relationships and people and everyone knew me haha, it was awesome. Also, i had great grades and was able to finish properly but with a whole lot of doubt on what to study in college.\n\nCollege and Bad Decisions\n\nThen it was time to attend college and well\u2026 I wanted to study music but many people had told me it wasn\u2019t profitable and many stuff in general, I was taking many opinions and in the end I went for Communication, even though I find it very difficult to improvise in social situations and improvising in general is a pain for me, I also have to say that I don\u2019t quite like using apps like TikTok and in media, so right now I am planning to go back and pursue my passion which is music, even though the concept of passion is not very applicable to me because the way people feels passionate is kind of alien to me, there are just things that I like and things that bore me out, and since music is the only thing that has been consistent thorough time.\n\nTyping me.\n\nAnyway, hopefully that\u2019s enough information to type me, in addition to that, I gotta say I wouldn\u2019t consider myself responsible nor decisive, I love my friends and family and I like to do the same things over and over again, they give me familiarity.

{"submission": "Here is my relationship with the past, and with the future: I have a lot of anxiety over/around the future, and tend to worry a lot about what hasn\u2019t happened yet/about things I don\u2019t actually have to focus on yet (for example, I actually volunteered to be one of four people who has their essay for English reviewed by their peers, and I remember that I need to turn mine in by Monday evening and have started writing an outline like we were supposed to, but thinking about how I\u2019m supposed to plan out each and every step kind of stresses me out, even though I\u2019ve written many essays and already have my evidence. I suppose that even now, as an 18yr old, I am somewhat worried about the judgement of my peers. I know that this probably will prove to be helpful, though.) I am quite tired right now, always am. I have sleeping issues, I will admit that I messed up my schedule about three years ago. \n\nI am probably partly cynical because I am depressed, and have experienced trauma. I also have anxiety. I have not done a great job of following up to make a new appointment for therapy/get a new therapist even though I know I probably need to see one again, and will be responsible for that myself now that I\u2019m an adult. \n\nI am definitely someone who tends to reflect on the past a lot. I was actually thinking this morning about a guy who I\u2019d had a crush on in freshman year (an ESTP, actually pretty toxic - I remember he once almost fought this girl in my grade because she tripped him a little on the stairs in senior year,) though I was thinking about how him saying I was a 4/10 had really affected my self esteem, and I had started thinking about it more because yesterday I realized (based off body language, facial expression, and general vibes) that a guy who I have been approaching to check in on in Statistics won\u2019t be asking me out. He is nice looking and most likely older than me. I felt rejected in a sense even though he didn\u2019t directly reject me (I would guess that he suspects I like him, though, even though he never said anything of which would indicate this.) \n\nI really lean toward being pessimistic as opposed to optimistic. I have been somewhat worried that I will be fired from the part time job I am working (I work with two-six year olds, and I started as an intern in July due to my prior involvement with Girls Inc) even though I have received absolutely no indication that this will happen. I was happy today at work, I just don\u2019t feel too great now since I seem to have a cold (it\u2019s started to get colder outside) and since I was having trouble with the lab simulation for Anthropology and had to zoom with my professor (I kinda got the vibe she thought it was silly that I was having so much trouble, even though she didn\u2019t say so, or that I\u2019m dumb.) \n\nThese are two social media accounts of mine (well actually, one of the things I\u2019m linking to is a story I wrote): https://instagram.com/bookreviewsbynairobi?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== and https://archiveofourown.org/works/38427709\n\nI will note that I actually do tend to \u201cnotice\u201d where others are looks wise. I am perhaps a shallow person, deep down inside. \n\nI actually do think that I may eventually have a child down the line, I\u2019d just like to be in a better place mentally and of course have a partner (I was partly so upset yesterday after I realized the guy doesn\u2019t want me, and likely will never text me, because I have grown up in a non-black environment and me not being terribly attractive has been emphasized because of it.)  \n\nI would describe myself as being someone who tends to overthink things. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t have a social life outside of school and work. I know that this is unhealthy. \n\nI still feel badly for my older brother even though he has wronged me before (said VERY aggressive things to me a year before he had a complete breakdown, I would have been in middle school.) I have found it easier to empathize with him as I have grown older since I have come to understand - and I didn\u2019t understand this when I was little - that our parents are abusive/bad people (to be fair, they \u201cchanged\u201d for a bit after I was born, more specifically my mother.)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16jwb1k)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.6198539}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -0.8770122}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.4668121}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.9178085}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.0686684}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -7.7325974}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -8.598429}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -8.666836}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.10206}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.327177}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -10.436733}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.005795}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -11.204407}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -11.552982}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -11.55629}, {"token": "-INF", "logprob": -11.823452}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -11.86277}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -11.864658}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -12.041346}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -12.110533}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.00079021323}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.5921006}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -8.877973}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.849942}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.117923}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -11.333224}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -12.036424}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -12.209811}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.362744}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.431739}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.5536375}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.222161}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.24763}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.480683}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -13.592526}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -13.652389}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -14.292867}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -14.342469}, {"token": "FG", "logprob": -14.677487}, {"token": "FW", "logprob": -14.80156}]}}

Some crazy girls did me what they call sexual harassment: they grabbed my buttocks and yelled in class how in love they were with me (which, of course, was more to annoy me than to flirt with me).\n\nMe at College\n\n* Sit at the back of the classroom.Nervous while speaking in front of class.\n* As soon as class finished, I reached home.\n\nMe at Work\n\n* Late arriving (although the schedule is flexible since IT is\n* I love to annoy a small group of people, but in a childishly offensive manner. I want to annoy you a little without offending you.\n* I rebelled once again against my boss (I ignored him) and told his boss I would quit when I finished my duties. His boss sent me a meeting, and I declined, stating that it was not necessary to talk. This latter boss (3 levels above me in EVP level) sent me a meeting and told me he cancelled a meeting to speak with me, so I ended up lowering my anger and accepting the meeting.\n* If I like you, I don't tell you; I annoy you.\n* If I hate you, I treat you very seriously.\n* People just say, Ah, it's just \"my name,\" when I do something they find weird.\n* I hate bosses who abuse those with less power (not fair).I tend not to speak with bosses or VPs, although I find more joy talking with the lowest-level analysts and helping them learn something.\n* I tend to say I would be a bad teacher because I don't have the patience, but people tend to say I'm good at explaining things.\n* I prefer my subordinates to do the talking while I keep analyzing things.\n* I procrastinate a lot.\n* I always crack a joke in the middle of a serious or non-serious topic (it takes me longer to be promoted, though).\n* I get angry at rules or situations where people are closed-minded.\n* I hate politics and find it stupid when people prioritize high-ranking bosses over anyone else.\n* I'm so much requested outside work hours so I prefer to turn off my work phone than accepting the call and tell them to fuck off.\n* I have changed my personal phone number several times. Now nobody from work can call me on that number and I can rest.\n* I cannot see something wrong without my mind trying to find a solution.\n* I don't talk that much. Just burst of time.\n\nMe at home\n\n* I'm the oldest brother, so I try to behave more appropriately.\n\nMe out there alone\n\n* Reversed\n* Don't show my goofiness.\n\nMe out there with close people\n\n* I display my goofiness to friends, whether people watch or not.\n* I enjoy making people embarrassed but despise being embarrassed myself (hypocritical social anxiety).\n\nLove Life\n\n* Sucks\n* I'm kind of not that ugly, but I feel so tired of going out and meeting new women.\n* I'm worried that if I get married, I won't be able to buy my favorite gadgets (I love gadgets).\n* I flirt by doing stupid things like making silly faces at the girl or asking stupid things.\n* I never pick up on women's signs. Women end up telling me they like me, or some friend of hers tells me.\n\nHealth\n\n* I'm on an SSRI for social anxiety for the fourth time. I always quit on my own when symptoms relapse.\n* I'm a little hypochondriac.\n\nMe in general:\n\n* I have compulsive behaviors, which I relieve with emotional shopping and eating. (I'm on a $20k USD bad debt right now.)\n* I'm a perfectionist.\n* I make hasty decisions and keep ruminating about whether other options are better for my OCP type. I doubt myself a lot.\n* I feel terrible fear on rollercoasters.\n* I'm afraid of flying and car speeds.\n* I distract very easily.\n* When people yell at me, it's perfective, and HP gets to 0. Loud noises and crowded places discharge me fast.\n* People don\u2019t always know when I\u2019m joking sarcastically or talking seriously.\n* I have an inner child who likes minions, Pok\u00e9mon, making people laugh with silly behavior, and making SFW, non-sexual, non-derogatory, and non-offensive jokes. I want to annoy you, but not hurt you.I suppress my emotions with fun and jokes and try to divert the topic.\n* I hate anger, sadness, and every strong emotion, and I hate showing them to people.\n* I\u2019m not an organized person.I try to avoid debates or discussions because something inside me wants to say something, but after that, I want out of the discussion because I'm a little anxious or get involved in the heat. I prefer to hear people debating.\n* I have much creativity and intelligence but am too lazy to keep focused or finish something.\n* My brain skips between thoughts on different topics instead of going in sequence. Ex: I'm writing a letter, but before I write the last part, I remember I need to fix a backend service for a colleague. I end up leaving the mail in draft and sending it days later.\n* People laugh when I make a mistake. They find me funny even when I'm not joking.\n* My brain absorbs every problem, even the ones I need to resolve, and I blame myself for the problem. Ex.: Mom is arguing with my brother; I must fix it. I tend not to look at problems, so my mind won't hurry to fix them.I am afraid of making a mistake, and when I do it, I feel ashamed, and it bothers me a lot.I say I don\u2019t care about what others say or think about me, but I do a little. SSRI makes it easier to ignore.Overthinking is my best friend, and Benzos doesn\u2019t like it.\n* I have a playful, fun side with people I feel close to or with people who haven\u2019t yelled at me.\n* When there are no bodies around at work, I do feel lonely. I prefer a few people around that let me in peace but keep close enough.\n* I'm good at brainstorming solutions for problems I create due to procrastinating.\n* People tag me as different or crazy.\n* People say there\u2019s no way I'm an introvert because I\u2019m very fun and smart. Part of the exception is IT workers who know how to communicate with people.\n* Social pressure can make me spit ideas, and the good ones need to be filtered.\n* I\u2019m more preoccupied with the future.I can be easily distracted from what I'm doing because my interest has been piqued by something else or because somebody has stopped by to say hi.\n* I have periods when I'm social, fanciful, and impulsive. Those times are usually followed by quite a bit of downtime and quiet introspection.\n* I take things personally.I like to watch or listen to heated discussions, and sometimes I start them. \n* I'm not that into reading books; I'm more visual.\n* I try to read people's faces before trying to softly annoy them.People at work like to include me in interviews because \"I\u2019m good at reading people.\n* \"I hate authority and have had problems with people three levels up in the company where I work. Nothing disrespectful. Just when my emotions can no longer be held. I just exploded in a crazy, sarcastic way.\n* People seem to love me more than I love myself.\n* When I'm at the store I prefer to spend time looking for the thing that asking for help finding it unless I'm in a hurry.\n* I hate to be hurried.\n* I constantly try to improve things even at the expense of spending my money or time. I always said when X it will be perfect and I will settle. That momento never comes so I keep repeating the cycle never resting.\n* I feel curious about people who are reserved, mostly women.\n* I enjoy the behavior of some ENTP fictional characters: the Joker (I like to watch bad people burn like C Levels from my job), Iron Man (quick brainstorming, sense of humor, good but self-absorbed), Jack Sparrow (good disguised as weird),I tend to finish lunch at work and visit another small group of people I know and bother them or make them laugh.\n* I love Gengar and Deadpool making fun of things.\n* I won\u2019t ask for help when needed, but eventually will let my pride lose so minions can work on the boring part :D. Exception at work because I'm a manager.\n* I try to do everything by myself almost always, and subordinates\u2019 complaints about me doing it at work\n* When at home and on weekends, I shut off the social button and close myself in my bubble\n* .I hate super-crowded spaces and loud noises. \n* Thank God for noise-canceling earbuds.I dress like a hippie. Mother hates that. I went to my brother's prom in Crocs, and Mom turned into Karen.\n* When I'm down emotionally, I don\u2019t want people around me.\n* When I\u2019m not social, I don\u2019t want people around me.I second-guess myself a lot on big decisions.I like birds.\n* I'm very pessimistic.I tend to get surprised when I say I can only do 40 and end up doing 100.\n\nGood luck with this!", "clean_guess": "Based on the text", "llm_guess": "Based on the text", "logprobs": {"Based": [{"token": "Based", "logprob": -0.8110905}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -1.9068356}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -1.9493198}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -2.1016235}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.375126}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -3.527279}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -3.9387875}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -4.3197117}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -4.823824}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -4.949423}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.040941}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -5.1054134}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -5.3289795}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -5.6051006}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -6.2573833}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -7.2413654}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -7.251692}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -7.2714424}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -7.3640194}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.431013}], " on": [{"token": " on", "logprob": -2.9352968e-06}, {"token": " off", "logprob": -13.277381}, {"token": " the", "logprob": -14.178884}, {"token": " of", "logprob": -16.456015}, {"token": " from", "logprob": -16.533548}, {"token": " solely", "logprob": -16.578022}, {"token": " in", "logprob": -16.741951}, {"token": " upon", "logprob": -17.158062}, {"token": " o", "logprob": -17.52337}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -17.902668}, {"token": "on", "logprob": -18.42231}, {"token": " this", "logprob": -18.871351}, {"token": " based", "logprob": -18.88999}, {"token": " On", "logprob": -19.033089}, {"token": " om", "logprob": -19.11278}, {"token": " ont", "logprob": -19.1709}, {"token": ",", "logprob": -19.24944}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -19.373796}, {"token": " purely", "logprob": -19.3836}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -19.478348}], " the": [{"token": " the", "logprob": -1.4140442e-05}, {"token": " this", "logprob": -11.531302}, {"token": " your", "logprob": -13.965812}, {"token": " a", "logprob": -14.043918}, {"token": " my", "logprob": -14.487672}, {"token": " analyzing", "logprob": -14.720033}, {"token": " his", "logprob": -15.079402}, {"token": " multiple", "logprob": -15.116809}, {"token": " all", "logprob": -15.173703}, {"token": " an", "logprob": -15.610736}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -16.299944}, {"token": " their", "logprob": -16.646637}, {"token": " various", "logprob": -16.746965}, {"token": " several", "logprob": -16.75586}, {"token": " details", "logprob": -16.946707}, {"token": " these", "logprob": -16.955578}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -17.330221}, {"token": " text", "logprob": -17.45472}, {"token": " detailed", "logprob": -17.457531}, {"token": " cognitive", "logprob": -17.71626}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.1580709}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -2.4972432}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -3.2558262}, {"token": " details", "logprob": -4.0985694}, {"token": " detailed", "logprob": -5.0855308}, {"token": " characteristics", "logprob": -7.847368}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -8.131295}, {"token": " behavior", "logprob": -8.15878}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -8.335622}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -8.388562}, {"token": " content", "logprob": -8.438153}, {"token": " extensive", "logprob": -9.002149}, {"token": " behaviors", "logprob": -9.063687}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -9.282758}, {"token": " described", "logprob": -9.475062}, {"token": " detail", "logprob": -9.62312}, {"token": " traits", "logprob": -9.721837}, {"token": " cognitive", "logprob": -10.037581}, {"token": " observations", "logprob": -10.243268}, {"token": " descriptions", "logprob": -10.314282}]}}

How do you deal with them?\n\ni have a really refined view of the past in a way, if i recall it, its about the moments i had with people i loved, or about a really impressive thing i've done. its pretty much nostalgia, but it does not come that often. i don't know about the present tho, i mean, its here, but i lead with it in a more \u201cwhat can i approach here, right now, that can make a nice scenario for me in a future\u201d, and the future, i think about it in a normal scale, don't if most of the time, but certainly a lot.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nif it's something i actually know and can help with, yeah. i would do it because i want them to reach their thing as well, the world is not just about me.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\ni don't know what the question means. but if its about more logical approach to logical problems, i would say yes, maybe.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nit depends a lot. i can be really pushy if it's something i care about, and if it's something that interests me. but things related to actual school, and having super high grades, and being super efficient all the time, no.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\ni wouldnt say so. if i want something, i ask someone, if its something that makes a lot of sense, i will debate about it and see the best arguments that actually make sense to defend my point.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nguitar, writing; perhaps, reading. I like them because i can see myself improving at something, impressing others, and impressing myself with it.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\ni like normal classes. but what bothers me the most are some of the subjects, that seem totally non-sensical in a way. but yeah, learning like normal schools do, i think its fine to me.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\ni break projects in parts. thats why i like working in groups most times, not bc i like groups, but because we can make a good work faster than if i worked alone all the time.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\ni want to study journalism at the university of Buenos Aires, i want to go to Porto Alegre when i'm in my 30s then live in London for some time. all with my spouse and children, of course.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nmy fear is seeing someone much better than me in a field i've been applying to having much better improvemente and results than me. i hate people that disliskes other people for no reason at all.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\ni smile more, i have a more happy outlook, i study more, sorta productive, and liked more.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nextremelly detached emotionally and physically, lack of confidence, laziness and less empathy.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni daydream a lot, sometimes im just staring while i'm thinking about something. but sometimes i can also be kinda in touch of \u201creality\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\ni would think about a lot of things, probably. personal life, something that i studied, idk, it depends.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nit depends on what kind of decision really. but mostly i take a lot of time, and i can see easily the consequences of my actions.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nemotions are part of my life, i think about them sometimes, its not my priority all the time, but sometimes its needed to actually help you to lead with people, and to love others.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nonly if it's something i don't really care about. if it's something that is actually meaningful and important, and i dont agree with them for real, i will try to tell them like \u201cno, i would prefer this way\u201d and see how it goes.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\ni break rules that are considered stupid, because i need to get on my way and have my own decisions as wel.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.22737366}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.8100114}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -4.510552}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.5222344}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -5.083159}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.117007}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.900395}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.420424}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.957953}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -8.18735}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -8.766559}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -9.268373}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.651723}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.747539}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -9.7814665}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.213876}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -11.242171}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -11.258613}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.270589}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -11.27192}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0012292771}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.8619547}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.34776}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.673579}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -11.611457}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -11.909293}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.901198}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.01378}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.469007}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.570296}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.757396}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.768197}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -14.214408}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.761237}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -14.804282}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.896438}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -14.941001}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -15.149808}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -15.359908}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -15.548848}]}}
{"submission": "Hi! I know for sure that I'm Si-dom. Honestly the Si-Ne axis is pretty clear in my day-to-day brain activities, but I'm less certain on which judging axis I use more. \n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nIn my 20s, female. Hello, nice to meet you. I enjoy making plans and recording down my daily life. Plans >> taking action and finishing them, though. I tend to be cautious and plan ahead a lot, likely to the point where I don't even realize it. I'm kind of a perfectionist and would try to correct flaws I see. I'm very picky toward who I let in, and I tend to reserve my energy toward those who I \"click\" with (for lack of a better word). Oh, actually, this is funny. I had this conversation with my brother earlier today about whether I get along with people or not. I was like, \"No, I do get along with people. I do.\" And then I realized that I actually don't associate with people much except for necessities unless I take a personal interest in them. Either we click or we don't, there's no forcing it. I only feel truly enthusiastic toward people or things I take interest in. \n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNone, but thank you for asking. \n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI'd say just the usual. I have a strict father and a more caring mother. For any structural influence, I would say that it comes from my environment rather than my family. I liked to be complimented as the student who was well-behaved as a child. I do think that it later manifested as assuming the mindset where if I do something to please another person, they have to do the same for me in a similar situation. I got pointed out that the world doesn't work that way quite a few times over the course of my life, but I still tend to assume so especially if I want to get close to that person. I feel unjustifiably angry when I think that this one person will be different from everyone else in my life, but they prove to not be. \n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nStudying as a student. If anyone asks me whether I like my field, of course I wouldn't like it. I feel like I should appreciate my opportunities since I'm lucky to have this privilege, but I also just couldn't care less. Of course I'd want to do okay enough to not end up homeless, but it's not fun. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nDepends on whether there's anyone or anything that I'm interested in currently. Usually I just drink that quality time up to feel relaxed. I feel like I'm always finding people or things that I take interest in, take a deep dive to get to know everything about that, but retreating once that spark dies or I feel like the passion and wish for intimacy I feel is not returned. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nReading novels, but it's hard to find ones that have everything I like, so this is more of an \"if I don't have anything better to do.\" I sometimes watch C-dramas, but I'm a picky watcher. I like journaling, but just words on a timeline + some comments on each event over the course of the day, no pictures. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI don't think I'm the classic definition of a curious person. Sure, there are things here and there that I'm curious about and search up on Google, but that's it. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nOh hell no. Please excuse my language. I would if I don't trust whoever is in charge, but that's also annoying because then I'd have to prepare to argue and defend my points against that person. Ugh, it's just so exasperating when there are conflicts. One way or the other, I'm going to do something wrong and then get hated for that. Like what if they're the wacko kind and decides to stab me? But if I just let them do whatever, somehow I'm going to be blamed for standing in the wrong place\u2014that's actually not always true, but it might happen. Please please please let people be normal, calm, civilized, sane human beings when we have to work in teams. Anyway, you get the inferior Ne. :P\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nAlso no. I wouldn't trip on my own foot, but I am pretty clumsy with my hands when cleaning, and let's not talk about sports. x\\_x\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nRecently, I've taken up trying to write short stories or novels again. So far still stuck on the outline. I tend to just repeatedly get into this or that art-related stuff only to realize that I'm bad at it. \n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nPast = resource, reminisce, \"oh that reminded me of this thing in the past it doesn't matter but I thought of mentioning it\" moments\n\nPresent = mostly focused on this but not fully there, present but also subjective present, \"let's see when's the nearest deadline\" present\n\nFuture = so the sun will explode some time in the future, oh how scary, oh aliens, nope let's ignore this\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nSometimes I feel like their tone is everything. I would help, but also the \"anything\" part is kinda sketchy. I don't want to get in trouble for helping them with illegal stuff, myself and loved ones >>> others. I'd still help others, but I would only actively help out people within my inner circle. Others are more just \"if they come to me and ask + it's just a 2-second thing.\" \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIdk, any specific examples in real life please? I don't understand what you mean here, I'm sorry. Like I wouldn't go around and be like \"lol your logic sucks lol that's not logical for you to say that,\" but I can realize when people's comments don't really line up with logic in terms of cause and effects. Should I really criticize them of that, though? I feel like I myself am not doing good enough in that department. But then sometimes I can't help but be judgmental for more so radical statements when they don't line up. Uhhh, I don't know, let's move on haha.  \n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nInstructions >>>>>>>>>> efficiency. Just let me follow that instruction on the box dammit. I don't care if it's faster. Just let me follow the instructions. It's safer this way. \n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nPerhaps? It doesn't register as that for me when I do it, but I come off as controlling when I try to care for others. What I consider as care, anyway. Like if I notice a friend or sibling is frustrated at perhaps a food not being as easy to eat as they want, then I assume that I should give them a tissue, cut up the food for them, or suggest that they can eat the food in a certain way. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI think journaling counts as one that stuck to me. Occasionally I take up projects to improve myself, currently on the losing weight one. I think reading up on the Enneagram or generally just trying to define myself more counts too, but it's more of an if I feel like it for passing time thing. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI'm not sure. Still exploring and hoping that it turns out okay. I like to take paper notes more than digital ones. I struggle more with understanding concepts. I remember teachers and parents alike saying that I should understand why I do something for a math problem, but for me, it was always step 1 step 2 step 3 and fake understanding of a concept enough to answer questions correctly. XD I would count that as understanding the concept, just not the textbook definition of understanding that, though. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nOkay? Okay, yeah. I think I do alright in it. I'm used to drawing up a plan for most things. Even for things like going somewhere or grocery shopping, I want to at the very least mentally go through what I have to do. It keeps the calm of the mind. It always shocked me how some people decide what to eat for breakfast right before the breakfast, perhaps they find my way tiring in return? \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally I'd like a stable job with colleagues who are nice people. Personally I want a soulmate sort of relationship, just you and me. I want to live to an old age and be able to lay on my bed in my comfy house with the love of my life, flipping through my journals with records of each day in the past, reminiscing what happened back then. We'd recount in detail our lives. It sounds great, and satisfying to think about. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI'd say the greatest fear is not being able to reach that personal aspiration in the previous question. Then along the path to that anxiety of not being attractive enough, and then not being authentic and real with my flaws to keep that. There's a great fear of the unknown, and I hate being lied to, but I also hate disrupting the peace. I hate people who act so high and mighty and won't stop with their criticisms (I'm actually guilty of being a hypocrite with this statement since I'm pretty judgmental too). \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nSee personal aspirations. But as of currently, I don't think I've ever felt happy in the sense that the word happy is supposed to give, with the height of emotions that I've always associated with feeling happy. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nTo have no support, or no one believes me, no one's on my side sort of thing. Or to have nothing in this world worth loving with everything I have.  \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI don't think I'm very aware of my surroundings. I don't fall on my face, but I don't remember what my surroundings look like. I mainly daydream about what food I want to eat next, or just notice something in my surroundings and then get snapped back to some random moment in the past. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nIf it's a large, white space with no boards to surround me, I would feel quite panicked and scared. If it's an enclosed space that also happens to be pretty dark, where the only sound I hear is my breathing, I actually feel pretty safe. Add other sounds to that, though, I might have a heart attack on the spot. Regardless, please get me out of here unless someone is waiting for me! Please!!\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIndecisive is my middle name. I probably troubleshoot until the deadline to make a decision based on moments in the past. And of course I might just change my mind just to be even safer. XD\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI usually take some time to cry a bit in private, but not so frequent. It's more of a some tears here and there over the course of a few hours, but no unleash the water faucet sort of crying. I'm the kind to have to process my feelings and put it down to words before I can do anything else. Sometimes I feel like it's hard to control negative feelings, and I don't want to burst out, but I do. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nWhen I take an interest in them, then yes. I actually had a friend mention that I sound fake at one point in my life. I really meant it, though. Perhaps I was overstepping with the compliments? With strangers, though, nod and smile, but really I just don't know what to say. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nNope, definitely more on the rule-abiding side. I generally think we should question the authority, but not so much that it becomes so extreme. I personally think that once you start pushing for an extreme to the point when you just stop thinking or questioning information you receive, that spells the doom for you. That being said, I definitely lean more on the following instructions side.

{"submission": "I'll just go by what I remember.   \n\\- Back when I was younger, I was quite a happy albeit shy introverted child that was rather risk averse. I was quite oblivious of many things back then and very annoying. I just do shit that amuses me even at the expense of others. Sounds mostly negative but I mean thats what it is right? I spent quite alot of time researching things that I am interested in, enjoyed creating stuff and I thought I was artistic lol. My practical skills went down by the time I became a teenager, but thats a story for another day. Just a brief rundown into the younger me, that is. Last time I didnt care so much about things and I just aimed to enjoy what I want to lol. My social skills back then were severely lacking, and I struggled to make friends lmao for obvious reasons. Caring about how people feel doesnt come naturally to me. \n\n\\- Lets talk about what people say about me. They tend to describe me as a goal oriented person, helpful, diligent, hardworking, inexpressive, calm, cool, no personality, when in reality, I think its more nuanced than that. In my personal life, I am abit more laid back and relaxed possibly making me see myself differently. I think that its true to some extent whatever they are saying because I chose to do it anyways, since I'd want to prove myself worthy in other's eyes and so on. Its something I can do for others but a little harder for me to really apply it in my own life, which is rather ironic I'd say. Idk, but theres this distinction between personal life and school stuff that I tend to overlook really. I mean, I just hide the real me in front of others so thats to be expected anyways, but I wonder if those sides are part of the real me, or they arent. I dont even know what I want, I can be so indecisive when on my own, but I can have like a vision for how I want things to be if I am doing something in service of others. Its a paradox. Some people think I am a good listener, but thats up for debate since I enjoy talking, however I still do enjoy listening to what others say since I want to learn from them as well. People do say I am opinionated which is true. Lastly, some others say that I am kinda mature for my age but I would never assert such a thing since I have low self esteem, but I mean, this only comes out when necessary anyways, like when we talk deep. I do, to some extent, enjoy that but the person has to engage in mutual understanding with me for that to even happen. These things could possibly help you develop a more holistic picture aside from how I might describe myself and help you understand another perspective such that you can factor in what might be true or might not be when trying to grab clues and seeing what may apply and what might not when typing me. \n\n\\- I am quite a nostalgic person, and I attach myself pretty easily to people or things. For people, I want validation and all. I can keep chasing and seeking out the things I am attached to lol, and I do that quite often to stop thinking. I just like to look back at my memories and the good times from time to time because its nice. I mean, the past takes on a little bit of an ethereal quality and I just think its more interesting than the future. The things of the past very generally appeals more to me than those of the future as they seem more abstract? Its weird lol. Its much more interesting. I dont generally show this side of me unless people understand, but I am very attached to the past. \n\n\\- I like to plan because I dont know how things will turn out and I dont want to lose track of important things so I just tend to plan to make sure I know stuff and the general structure/outline of how I'd like things to be. This is especially if I dont want to lose out on an opportunity and so on and so forth. I can improvise when needed, but I hate sudden changes in plans when its not favourable. This is especially how I can be kinda goal oriented in my daily life when it comes to getting the things I want. I hold myself to a high standard and can be a really big perfectionist. If anything, I am heavily critical on myself and can get defensive and stubborn because I somehow want to protect my ego at the same time. Very contradictory if you ask me, but thats what I know. I just hate how I tend to be selfish sometimes when it is convenient for me to just be like that generally. The reason why I am so goal oriented and etc is because I am jealous of others and I am just scared of losing out, but I mean if it gives me drive, might as well relish in it? \n\n\\- My main goal is to just enjoy life, but I tend to never be satisfied with what I have, and thats what I need to learn. Time to expand on my flaws here. Besides the fact that I am so perfectionistic and critical of myself, and it being the reason I can be so stubborn, the other thing is that I can be very confrontational which can be good in some cases but I can be so fixated and I hate this part of me. Ironically I can also be open minded, but its like when things are quite good. I dont like changing myself for others not because I want to maintain my individuality or be unique, but its difficult, tiring, burdensome, and all, for me to do it. I just dont want to do it. I can jump to conclusions very easily and usually this is more on the negative side of things yet can be very indecisive in knowing what I want or what is good for me in a particular context which I did say earlier. Alot of this happens much more when I am stressed but its already like that when I am not, but to a smaller extent. I have shitty self esteem issues too lol. \n\n\\- I am not good at ideation, creating ideas and so on tbh, however, I do enjoy speculating and knowing what the future may hold. Its interesting and provides a sense of closure for me so yea I do that. I tend to be straightforward like this when I just want to make it concise where possible like this because too long, and people wont read already. However, ppl who know me knows I tend to ramble a whole lot. \n\n  \n", "clean_guess": "INTJ", "llm_guess": "INTJ", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.8657253}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.5661533}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.6915061}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.2015674}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -3.167836}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.8984268}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -5.631892}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.880618}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.4303446}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.6505327}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.037545}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.615199}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.713971}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.9126215}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -8.039666}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.114915}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -8.758681}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -9.462625}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -9.498221}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -9.527883}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.45447385}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -1.0073303}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.263998}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.2637615}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.43873}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -13.49321}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -14.883324}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -15.176771}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -15.38162}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -15.405552}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -15.435509}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.442759}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -15.533287}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -15.536559}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -15.747571}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -15.757128}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -15.761092}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -15.780401}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -15.823512}, {"token": "PJ", "logprob": -15.86153}]}}
{"submission": "How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. I'm a 23 year old girl. I am extroverted, empathetic, no-nonsense, matter of fact, and (hopefully) funny lol.\n\nIs there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow? N/A\n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? I had a tremendous childhood. I grew up in church my whole life and in Christian school. It\u2019s the best thing that ever could have happened to me and I thank God that He directed my parents to do so\n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? I was the Training Director at a CFA. I loveddd my position and what the job detailed. I love teaching people how to do things. I did not like the people I worked with because they just didn\u2019t respect me. I am now a Corporate Training Specialist for a restaurant business that works remotely and I enjoy the fact that I can get all my work done in a span of a few concentrated hours and I have the freedom to be able to travel and just take my laptop with me!\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? Um I\u2019d hate it so much. If feel super ridiculously lonely and try to FaceTime with whoever would answer or if there\u2019s the option to leave to go hang out with someone else I\u2019d TAKE IT. I\u2019d also feel super anxious at every noise that someone was trying to break into my house lol.\n\nWhat is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i? Um, I\u2019ve never really thought about it, but i used to play sports as a kid. I love going to basketball games and I get super into sports when I actually do/want to watch them lol. I also love exploring my area and going to different coffee shops and restaurants.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? Yessss. I\u2019ve had so many ideas and they\u2019d be so detailed that I\u2019d get overwhelmed trying to put them on paper. Sooo many book/play ideas. I just can never figure out how to execute them in the exact way I want so then I give up lol. I just *know* how I want it to look in my head, but I struggle figuring out how to translate it to real life lol.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? I have been in one before and I liked while I was in it, but I\u2019m too laid-back and conflict averse to want to be in the top leadership position. Frankly, I don\u2019t care about my position so long as people treat me with respect and value my opinion(not necessarily agree, but just respect my thoughts, feelings, and opinions lol).\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? I am definitely clumsy. Like, think Mia Thermopolis lol. I like baking/cooking if that counts. I love it because I can pour all my attention into it, especially if I have a lot on my mind. It makes me feel grounded.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. I am a little. Although any \u201cartistic\u201d projects I accidentally turn scientific(i.e. baking) or become an over perfectionist.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them? I try only to remember the past to help me remember the mistakes I made so I don\u2019t make them again. I don\u2019t really think of the past otherwise. I mean I remember good things from my childhood. I think I\u2019m more so focused on the present and the next right thing, but I like to dream of the good things to come. Although there are times when I can get hyperfixated one the past and things I\u2019ve done wrong and that can be tough to escape, but God always helps me and gets me out of those scenarios I put on myself lol.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? I\u2019ll do it if I feel well equipped or am available. I\u2019d help them cause as humans we should try to help one another.\n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life? 100% yes\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you? I try to be efficient in the best way I can, but sometimes I just need to relax(which I don\u2019t think is the direct opposite of being productive tho) because if I work til empty I find I\u2019m not even that productive at that point and start making mistakes.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? I don\u2019t believe so. I wouldn\u2019t ever do it consciously and I don\u2019t think I would do it at all.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them? Reading, singing, playing the guitar, cooking, and baking. I like any activity that I can fully immerse myself in.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? I prefer physical senses when it comes to learning, I don't like memorization at all. Hands on training is my fav and I find it the most efficient.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? I usually will try to plan it, but end up just winging it.\n\nWhat's important to you and why? This may be cheesy to some, but living a life that pleases Christ because in it is fullness of joy, peace, and He is just worthy of it no matter how it benefits me.\n\nWhat are your aspirations? To serve God with everything I have and submit more and more to Him as time goes on. To be the best person i can be. To be better and smarter, and wiser. To give myself more grace. And to just have a good life(which i do!).\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why? I\u2019m afraid of the unknown. Like the ocean FREAKS me out cause like only 5% has been discovered i think? LIKE IS NO ONE ELSE IS WEIRDED OUT BY THAT??? i don\u2019t like when people invaded my space. I hate being ignored and talked down to. I also despiseeee being yelled at, but that seems like it would be a universal experience. It\u2019s like tho, WHO do you think you are to talk to *anyone* like that?????\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like? The best times are the simple ones that I\u2019ve spent with my family and/or friends and Jesus.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like? I used to literally hate everything about myself and I felt like my life was going no where. When I feel like I have no purpose at all I get discouraged. And I feel really low when I will unfortunately get overly angry with members of my family.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? I daydream a lotttt. I will be in the moment when I\u2019m with someone, but when I zone out I\u2019m still kind of aware of my surroundings unless I\u2019m exhausted lol.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? How to GET OUT!\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? I take a while and then I just make a decision cause I just want to decide and get it over with lol. It would depend on the importance and the flexibility of the decision.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? I will never mean to not process my emotions or ignore them because I\u2019ve realized how toxic ignoring my emotions could be.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? Uh, not really. If i don\u2019t agree with you I\u2019m not gonna lie. I\u2019ll just say \u201cagree to disagree\u201d lol.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you? I rarely(if ever) break the rules. They\u2019re there for a reason right? But if I find them unethical I will take it up with the authority and challenge them.\n\nWhat is the ideal life, in your opinion?

{"submission": "For a long time I suspected I'm an intj, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThe reason I'm not sure if I'm an intj anymore is because of the way I think. Intjs are often analytical and incredible problem solvers. But I'm a pretty observant person myself, I'm often told I have a good eye. The difference is that my mind is either running at a crazy speed, making up crazy scenarios, or not thinking at all to the point where I can't get my mind to think clearly. I can never reach a conclusion, but I'm making up all these endless possibilities. I love problem solving, seeking answers, and learning. But there comes a time when I'm no longer in a productive state of mind. I relate a lot to the intj type, but I'm starting to think that I was wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, what I do relate with about intjs is that I do like to be observant, and I'm all about attention to detail. I agree with the consensus that speaking the truth is better than telling someone what they want to hear. I require time alone to recharge.

{"submission": "Hi, any MBTI nerds here who also are autistic? How does autism (or in general also mental disorders) affects your typology?\nLet me get this straight.\nIt\u2019s been a long time I\u2019ve been having the thought I\u2019m mistyped. I\u2019m a very diffident person IRL and I\u2019m not interested in socialising if I don\u2019t have interests in common. I\u2019m the classic \u201cstereotypical autistic introvert\u201d in the eyes of most, in fact if I take a test I\u2019m very likely to get INTP (or INFP???) as the results. Of course, if you read the functions it makes no sense.

I\u2019m not comfortable using Se but it would be impossible for me not to use it (even if as autistic I need to always be focused on the future to function correctly)\nIs it possible being ENTJ even if I am not an extrovert because of my autism?

{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am 20 years old, female. I would say that I am a pretty outwardly calm but inwardly insane individual. Just kidding but I tend to overthink a lot inside and on the outside look like I have it all together. I'm pROBABLY a 9w1, 2w1, and 6w5 (don't quote me on that) in no specific order because I have no idea and I switch it everyday. I don't know if that helps lol\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI have anxiety, depression, and PTSD. So it makes me overthink a lot or get stuck in certain situations from the past.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing had no structure at all. I did not have any religious influence, any schedules, etc. I responded to this very poorly. I barely slept, I barely ate, and I definitely did not do my homework. Eventually, as I got older and moved out on my own, I started developing a structure and now I would say my days are fairly structured. I have a general routine that I follow everyday, pretty much wake up around the same time and go to sleep at the same time. And have certain rituals I follow daily but switch up from time to time. I also began exploring various religious possibilities when I got to around middle school, but its hard for me to commit to one. I end up spending a lot of time kinda researching about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nRight now I just work at a deli. So far I really like it, it's pretty relaxing and routine work. I also like that everyone at my work is nice and so we all get along super well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel lonely if I was entirely alone. I do like my alone time, but only to a certain extent. I would consider myself socially ambiverted. I can go maybe a day or two without social interaction, but then I start to feel really bad afterwards and I get these twinges of loneliness lol. I generally like to just be in the company of one person, even if we aren't talking but just in eachothers presence. I'm just quiet in general so even if I'm around people I don't talk a ton.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI don't know if this means physical activities or hobbies but I'm going to assume physical activities. I HATE SPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I am awful at them. The only sport I like is swimming. Does that even count as a sport..? I assume yes. I don't really like physical activity at all and I tend to just sit all day. But I do like walking outside and the occasional yoga. I prefer workout classes to working out at home for sure. So I guess.. outdoor is better? I just like experiencing things and getting out of the house whenever I can even if I don't really like the activity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am curious but I'm not really an idea kinda gorl. I don't really think I come up with many ideas. The main thing I have ideas of are how people should behave, and I think of the way the world could be if people just changed their actions to be a more moral and kind. I am also interested in other peoples ideas. Does it count as an idea if you have ideas of what you could do with your life like the type of person you could be or the type of job you should do for the rest of your life but then change it everyday....? Because thats what I do. I mainly just have ideas on who I could become or the things I could do with my life but just as quickly as they come they are gone. I think my ideas are more environmental because it basically just comes from things I see and then get inspired by. They aren't really abstract concepts but more straightforward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI only take on a leadership position with people who are more shy than me. Otherwise.. not really. I prefer not to take a leadership position. I think it's way too high stress and I'd prefer not to. As a leader, I tend to just do more gentle suggestions than actual commands. Like hey maybe we could do \\_\\_\\_\\_. And I often use the wording of we instead of you to kinda soften the statement. So really it's more of just.. a friend who suggests what you could be doing. I try to be more for the people than the job because the job at the end of the day doesn't matter much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not coordinated at all. I zone off a lot.. I trip a lot.. I try to coordinate my hands and my feet but I get too focused on one aspect that I ignore the other aspect. I do like working with my hands though and think it's super fun. I like to cook.. bake.. craft.. play with stress toys lol. I like hands on activities the most if I'm not spending my time reading Reddit. I just like to do anything to keep myself busy at all times or I get bored and feel like I should be doing something. I like to clean and organize too but sometimes I really don't want to and I have to use all my power to force myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI would say... no. not really. I mean.. I like crafting.. I enjoyed knitting for awhile but fell off of it. I do like art when I actually do it but most of the time I hesitate to start. I love writing poems but I can only write them when I feel sad and lately I've been feeling good so.. no poems lately. I LOVE ART though. I love looking at art and could look at it all day, I love reading poems, I love any artistic medium at all really. I think it is so amazing and it's crazy that somebody could have that skill. I also like how you can feel the artists emotions through their work a lot of the time. Art is just so amazing to me in every aspect. Old art, new art, futuristic art, art of hamsters doing people things, anime art, etc.. everything is beautiful. I also feel inspired by art to sort of craft myself. Like sometimes I will be scrolling and see art of a clown and I'm like.. I WANNA DRESS LIKE A CLOWN AND JOIN THE CIRCUS. So it's very impactful to me and can inspire my new dream of the week lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past has formed who I am and every experience I've lived through has brought me new understanding and peace within myself. I feel that a lot of the time the past has something you can learn from it, and often times what happens to you happens because you needed to learn a lesson from it. The present and the past are my primary modes of living for sure. I think that you have to enjoy the present moment you have, because in a second it could fall out of your hands. Seize the moment however you can, and just try to fill it with things that make you feel happy. The future to be honest I don't really care about. The only thing I even think of about the future is like.. what if my life is different. What if I broke up with my partner or what if we get married. How many kids will we have. Blah blah blah. It's mainly shit like that lol so it's not really something I think about very often. I probably actively try to avoid thinking about the future because I just think it's boring to think about in general. Anything could happen.. whats the point of me even thinking about it. Though when I get anxious sometimes I will think about how my life could go wrong in the future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nAnytime anyone asks for my help, I will help them without question. Sometimes I don't necessarily even want to do it but I feel like it's the right thing to do and also I feel awkward if I say like.. hey... I'm busy right now actually. So I end up pretty much being at everyones beck and call if they ask me for help. But I also do think that it is important to be a good person in your life and to do everything you can to help others. We live such short lives and the lives that we live shouldn't be lived primarily selfishly in my opinion. So that's why I would want to help people.. but of course there is also a selfish side of me that just wants people to like me and wants them to rely on me. So I don't think anyone has entirely pure or entirely selfish intentions to begin with. It's more of a mixed bag and I think as long as you are doing good it shouldn't really matter WHAT your intentions are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nOk like. I would say I live primarily in a mode of focusing on emotions and gut feelings. I tend to just always go with what feels right. But I also do value logical consistency when it comes to like.. idk shit like medical or factual stuff. Like with that stuff you shouldn't play around and say IMMA DO WHAT I WANT and then die of disease. I think that's kinda common sense. So.. yes...? But also selectively so. I want to have facts to back up my opinions and things that I would try to convince people of too, so that's where consistency is important because you can't just tell somebody you are right because you feel you are right. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nUhhh not very important but I do try to get my schoolwork done early so that I don't have to be anxious about it for the next week. It doesn't always work out that way though. I have bursts of energy so I just work when I have those specific bursts.. sometimes it is early.. and other times it is 1 hour before my homework is due unfortunately. But yeah.. productivity isn't important to me really. I always say I'd rather have an enjoyable life and that work isn't everything and doesn't determine my self worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI will say I've had control issues in my life. I have very intense specific ideas of morality and what people should be doing. I don't tend to force them on people that I don't really know all that well, but the people who have been close to me know that I am very strict when it comes to my morals and what I believe people should do and how they should act. I think this is pretty much controlling people.. because if you argue with them everytime you disagree on their morals then they will probably feel like they shouldn't do said thing. And I also have had some times where I've given people ultimatums where I say you can either stop doing this thing or I don't want you in my life essentially. I just don't see a point in having people in my life who disagree with me on things that are extremely important to me. That's why I don't really care about controlling people I don't know, and will mainly just try to keep the peace with them. Because it isn't like I'm going to be their friend anyways lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI like reading Reddit a lot. I spend a lot of time just researching a lot of random subjects. One of those recently has been religion like I maybe said earlier I can't remember if I did or not. I basically will research every aspect of something I possibly can. Like in this example I've been researching paganism, christianity, buddhism, catholicism, gnosticism, etc.. mainly just for funs sake but also because I want to figure out what aligns with what I believe. I tend to get very deep into a topic for awhile and then switch into another and then another and another and eventually go back into those old topics too. I also like to just go outside and go literally ANYWHERE. I will go to the grocery store for fun.. I will go anywhere anyone invites me to go (if it's someone I'm close to and won't get drained by......) I don't know if that is a hobby. I also like just scrolling Pinterest and staring at art for awhile. Or just.. scrolling reels. I don't think thats a hobby either. But that's all I do with my time so take it or leave it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI am a hands on learner. I need to do things myself to get a feel for them, otherwise I forget how to do them. I struggle with those learning environments where they just give you a pamphlet for how to do something. Or training videos especially.. I will forget everything they told me. Auditory learning is definitely the WORST. I like classes involving creativity and physical senses the most. I think it's a lot of fun when classes will give you freedom on how you can do something, but I do like a little structure still. I like to know what exactly I should do when it comes to like structuring an assignment, but apart from that freedom on everything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nAs I've gotten older I've started to break up projects into manageable tasks. When I was younger, I would just wing projects and improvise everything. Now I try to have a little bit of a plan and break it up into tasks so that I don't get too stressed and burn out. I do improvise things like essays though. I just write whatever is on my mind and it ends up writing like 10 pages and then I just rewrite it in a little bit different wording.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI don't really have any professional aspirations. Personally, I just want to pursue love. I want to bring joy wherever I go, and I want to make people happy and comfortable around me. I eventually want a family too. I really like the idea of having a stable family life and teaching my kids to be good and kind people. I want to just do good and bring more good than bad to the people around me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nMy fears are that people are going to betray me or lie to me and that my entire life will be a lie. I need to know that people are truthful and honest, even if it hurts me. I hate dishonesty, I hate immorality, I hate how a lot of people don't consider others feelings, I hate selfishness. I don't think we live on this planet entirely for ourselves. At the end of the day, everything we do impacts other people. I can't stop anybody from living a selfish life where they refuse to think about the implications of their actions, everybody is in control of themselves and nothing I say or do can change who they are. That fact makes me uncomfortable too, that you can't really fix anybody. You have to let them come to it themselves. For me, I try to always think about the people my actions impact. Even if I do not know those people, or I will never meet them. Things like environmental causes. In our lifetime we probably won't suffer from the lack of care, but other people who have not even been born yet will suffer far more. There's always a consequence to every action people take, they just have to weigh them and choose the best path they can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe highs in my life are rare but great. I have a lot of hope for the world, I have a lot of love for everyone around me, I have all these things that I want to do and I don't feel like I can't do them. I want to just be myself, and care for the people around me and teach them that their life is also worth living. I want to inspire people, put words to those great feelings. I don't have any bitterness in these times, I don't think about things I wish I could change about the world or people, I just have understanding for people coming from different walks of life and how they aren't perfect just like me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe lows in my life are very intense. I get very depressive, very isolated, I start to think about how everything around me is a lie. I fall into the trap of thinking that nobody cares about me, and their actions prove it. I want to change the world, I hold intense bitterness because people are not good and they are selfish. It's all I can think about, and it basically consumes me where I start thinking all day long about the immorality of certain actions, which causes me to isolate even further and cut off everybody around me because I find every one of the faults in them. I can also become very aggressive with the people I'm close to and criticizing them for the way they behave or the things I consider bad that they do. Sometimes I try to understand them, but it just falls through when I think \"well I used to do what you did and I got better so why can't you\" and then I get even more bitter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI am often very unattached to reality. I sometimes feel like I am sitting on a little chair in my brain, watching myself interact but it isn't really me, it's just somebody else who is living for me. I also have a hard time noticing things in my environment because I am always thinking, mainly about people. Most of my thoughts are about other people. I daydream a lot, it's not really fantasy daydreams but rather just concepts I've been reading about or again.. my morals and how they relate to the world around me. People always make fun of me because I miss obvious things in my environment, and sometimes I also spend the whole day on autopilot and walk into doors and shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nSurprise surprise.. I think about people, my morals, and the person I strive to be. I am always thinking about how I can become a better person, do better things, be kinder, how I can impact others to become and do better too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI make decisions on a whim regretfully. I don't really think about it at all. I have had problems with changing my major where I change it without even thinking about it when it spurs on in the moment. I quit jobs on a whim based on the intense feelings I have that day. I decide to move or not in like a day of thinking. I do change my mind sometimes, but other times I feel like because I already decided this thing for myself it's over and I shouldn't try to change it again. I have a lot of doubts about the things I do, but generally believe they are for the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI process emotions without any effort at all. I don't even have to think about it, but I still do. I always know exactly what I'm feeling and why I'm feeling it. Emotions are EXTREMELY important to me. Emotions are my biggest strength, without them I'd be nothing. They allow me to have empathy, understand the world around me, understand myself, understand deeper parts of the human psyche, etc. I use them to navigate everything I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes, all the time. I will agree with people just because I don't want to cause conflict or issues. This is mainly with people I don't know really well or those I really value the opinions of, that I will just agree with everything they say and avoid conflict at all costs. Sometimes it hurts me in my heart because I agree with things I don't really agree with and then it makes me want to vomit because I'm not being genuine but at the same time I do it because I am afraid they are going to scream at me if I don't agree with everything they say lol. But yeah, it's mainly with people I'm not close to. Which happens to be most people. With people I am close to, occasionally I will agree with them or just disengage from the conversation to avoid conflict, but other than that I am mostly very honest with my disagreements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nTo be honest I just really don't care about rules but I will try to follow a general structure still. Like.. I'm not going to follow rules I think are stupid or generally not for the best. I just tend to do things my own way, and normally nobody really comments on it but sometimes I've gotten into trouble for it at work. I don't really care either way about challenging authority. Lord knows I'm not gonna be the one to confront authority, even if I think about it in my head. Most of the time though I find that authority just follows what they are told by their higher power (corporate in the case of work) and that it isn't necessarily how they really feel but them following that structure is what got them to be authority to begin with. So I don't really know if it's that big of an issue with them most of the time, but I don't think they always do things with the intention of being the best but rather just doing what they are told. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16m4b5f)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.10655514}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.075559}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.188987}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.725295}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.2116137}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.5466185}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -8.221639}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -9.003247}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.00809}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.039128}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -9.307853}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -9.439441}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.53449}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -9.909293}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.192901}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -10.3201}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -10.402471}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.481681}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -10.497764}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.792211}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.001300473}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.29627}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.4454155}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -8.623417}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.198311}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -10.740173}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.815111}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -11.340519}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -11.655249}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.773027}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -11.972321}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -12.22229}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -12.335306}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -12.357624}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.175444}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -13.23865}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -13.323923}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.358011}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -13.733541}, {"token": "_", "logprob": -13.795001}]}}
{"submission": "This is in response to some of the questions in the pinned post.  \n\\- 14 female  \n\\- When I was younger(than I am now) I was always really loud and narcissistic. Then for two years I got really quiet, although I can't recall the exact reason why. But personally for me it's just easier to hide my emotions that way. Since I can't talk as much if I'm experience negative emotions. Then I realized that this was absolutely pointless, so I stopped being unnecessarily quiet.  \n\\- If I had to spend an entire weekend alone, I think I might feel lonely. Mostly because I love my parents. Although I do just spend most of my time in my room rather than going outside and socially interacting with people, and I'm usually pretty content.  \n\\- I like drawing, or generally just being lazy. Sports really aren't for me.  \n\\- I'm not that curious, unless it's a topic I actually care about, and would like to understand further. Even so, I never really dig that deep.   \n\\- I don't think I'd be too bad in a leadership position. All you need to do is give everyone tasks to do right? Excluding the 2 years of me being asocial I usually take the initiative in group settings.  \n\\- I don't believe that I'm very coordinated. I procrastinate a lot, I don't organize my things, I'm lazy, my memory is shit. I do like hands on activities more (in school) since they're more interesting.  \n\\- I am artistic, since it's fun, a good way to kill time, and gives me a sense of accomplishment. Also, it's fun to look back on your old art and see how much you've improved. My art is usually blends of things I find aesthetically pleasing.  \n\\- My opinions on the past, present, and future. The past is an extremely good tool to learn from. Ponder on it for a reasonable amount of time, but don't overthink about things you can't change. The present should be enjoyable, if not, you screwed up somewhere. So ponder on the past. Future. I don't worry about it much at all. It's not something I have control over, and if it was, it'd just be boring to be able to control it.  \n\\- If people request my help I would to the extent that it doesn't negatively effect me too much. I'd except the request, since I don't have anything better to do with my time, so why not give them a hand?  \n\\- I don't need logical consistency in my life. I don't care, as long as life is enjoyable, and will continue to be that way.  \n\\- Efficiency and productivity aren't important to me. I'm lazy.   \n\\- I like to draw, because I want to be able to create things that I'm proud of.  \n\\- I learn better when I actually experience something. That is, if I don't understand the concept right away. I think I'm not as great with problems that require me to think outside the box, takes longer to process since it's not what I'm primarily used to. Also I find that I get tunnel vision a lot.   \n\\- I'm good with strategizing, I just don't do it much, since winging it is usually less work. Only times I actually strategize and plan things out is when I'm extremely stressed, as it gives me a sense of security.  \n\\- I'm assuming that tangible fears like spiders are irrelevant, since it doesn't say that much about my personality. I wouldn't want to lose the ones I love and be surrounded by people I dislike ig.  \n\\- My \"highs\" in life would just be me being content and not worrying about anything.  \n\\- My \"lows\" in life would consist of extreme stress, a lot of work, with no one I can lean on.  \n\\- I actually used to be able to fully immerse myself in fantasy scenarios, I don't do that anymore though. However, often times I still feel like Im more in my head than actually grounded to reality. Not sure how to fully describe, but it's like, I'm not actually paying attention to what's happening around me, and my focus is somewhere else, although I'm not sure where.   \n\\- If I were in a blank empty room with nothing to do and no one to talk to, I'd probably find something to do, unless I'm just physically unable to move. In which I'd spend a bit of time pondering my options, before deciding that I'm actually screwed, and daydreaming about one of those fantasy scenarios I made up, whilst waiting for something to happen.  \n\\- I haven't had to make many important decisions, nor could I think of any. I do make decisions pretty quickly though, although it's difficult to imagine how I'd feel after making those decisions. So often times, I do end up regretting it.  \n\\- I can process my emotions fine. As in I classify them into negative and positive, and if negative I try to find the general cause of it. I used to be extremely obsessed with picking apart all of my negative emotions, and trying to find a name for the exact emotion I was experiencing. But what's the point?  \n\\- Im not a people pleaser so if I'm actually involved in the conversation, and disagree with something, I'll state my opinion, or nod in acknowledgement of the other person's statement. I wouldn't express the fact that I agree with them though.  \n\\- I don't break rules often. Sure challenging authority is often how famous scientists or some shit made revolutionary discoveries, but I'm not interested in being special and making a change. Breaking rules just gives me more things to stress about. Although if it's a minor rule that I find makes no sense, I may break it. Often times I trust the higher ups though, since if something goes wrong I could just blame them.  \nAnyway, I think I'm an isfp. Se is kinda weird though.

I really like Lanthimos' movies for instance, their surrealist deadpan humor is just perfect.\nThere are no thoughts up in here.\nMainly occupied with material needs, listening to some human whispers (audiobooks) or watching one piece (reconnecting with the childhood enthusiasm of being swallowed up in a fictional universe).", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.023042925}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.439675}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -5.3339715}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -5.390536}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -7.312567}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.568373}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.805435}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -10.118469}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.137035}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -10.137289}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -10.172493}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.386749}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.532421}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -10.730654}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -10.841352}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -11.817425}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -11.841686}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.974173}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -12.099041}, {"token": "Poss", "logprob": -12.12175}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.103613436}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -2.3184762}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.766778}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.821612}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -16.025982}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -16.492416}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -16.715431}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -16.737003}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -17.129358}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -17.254166}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -17.420336}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -17.463305}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -17.541853}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -17.698917}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -17.752884}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -17.860268}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -17.935068}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -18.075834}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -18.135632}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -18.164597}]}}
{"submission": "\nHe is my older brother. He is presently in rehab for substance use addiction (and was apparently transferred to a different center recently, perhaps due to relapsing.) However, our parents were abusive (my mother was a \u201cgood parent\u201d for a few years, but both still ultimately raised him in an unstable environment and my father threatened to beat him when he was little. It unfortunately makes sense that he has as many issues as he does at present.) He is \u201coff\u201d now himself, though if you have met my father (and my mother too, honestly) this shouldn\u2019t be a shocker (our father is an unintelligent, emotionally abusive alcoholic who I remember did not treat my brother well at all when he was young/in high school.) Our parents are both psychologically unhealthy. I remember that he started abusing drugs in either his second or third year of high school, though strangely enough, I couldn\u2019t really \u201ctell\u201d at the time - I knew that he smoked pot and he did not stop doing so entirely even though he had once gotten into trouble for doing so at school. I don\u2019t remember what specifically happened, I just have a memory of being in elementary school and sitting in the office with he and my mother.) As much as I hate to say it, it\u2019s like he\u2019s psychologically become a little more like my father over the years. He has not just cut my parents off entirely in spite of the fact that both are terrible and my father favored me when we were little (I remember he once pushed me down and kicked me years ago, I think that this was likely a factor - I was technically standing in font of his shoes.) \n\nHe was enrolled in college courses for a bit in 2020 online but ended up going to rehab and dropping them (he would have been taking them very slowly. He dropped one of the classes because they showed an aborted fetus and I guess this bothered him. \n\nI remember that he struggled to get a girlfriend during high school, and once started to tell me about a girl he met at a party a few years back and how he was trying to get back in contact with her (he told me about a year ago.) He apparently did suggest over the phone last year that he \u201chad a girlfriend\u201d in high school, though. I remember that he almost didn\u2019t graduate from high school, though I think that the drug usage and my school\u2019s racism were the greatest factors. \n\nI have realized after rewatching videos from the Youtube channel I had in elementary school that he was likely depressed back then, even though he was a pretty normal kid in middle school who just liked to play video games. I remember that when I was little, I most definitely couldn\u2019t really \u201ctell\u201d that he had any kind of problems, nor could I have predicted that he would turn out the way he has turned out (though I suppose that I was really blind to my family\u2019s dysfunction when I was in elementary school.) \n\n I regard him as being the member of my immediate family who is the most empathetic (though I am definitely dismissing some of his past behavior in suggesting this. I do seem to remember that he wasn\u2019t a \u201cbad\u201d person when he was in elementary and middle school even though our parents don\u2019t have good morals, and I know that he did really love me when I was a baby/toddler - you can tell when you see older photos of us.) He is five years older than me - born in December 1999.) He did well in middle school (was on the honor roll) even though he likely has an undiagnosed learning disability.\n\nI will note that he did not \u201cavoid\u201d our maternal grandfather when grandpa would come to visit even though my grandpa apparently once slapped him for standing in front of the football game when he was little and apologized. I did once get the impression that he regarded our grandpa\u2019s claims that he\u2019d be getting the house they lost back as ridiculous, though, much like my mother did (grandpa never did get the house back. None of us had really believed he would.) \n\nSomething strange about him is that even though he (and I do mean this in the nicest way possible) definitely doesn\u2019t quite sound like he has the strongest grasp of things *now* if you talk to him (it\u2019s really sad, I think it\u2019s once again a combo of the drug usage+also definitely past trauma because a lot of the times I\u2019ve noticed ever since he had that breakdown that when you talk to him he sounds kind of young like the drugs have damaged his mind) I remember that when he first started getting \u201cinto\u201d drugs in high school (well, I remember it as having just been pot) he seemed to sort of \u201cstudy\u201d it (like online) and seemed to have a fair understanding of what different drugs were and that sort of thing? Like when he would have been about fifteen (though it\u2019s been a really long time since then, so I might not be getting the age right.) I also remember that he once corrected me when I mispronounced \u201cperipheral.\u201d These little things lead me to believe that he is not, and was not, \u201cdumb\u201d like our parents and some other people said he was (though I suppose it\u2019s too late for me to try getting that into his mind. I feel bad for saying this, but most of the time, now that he\u2019s abused the drugs for years, he *does* sound to me like he\u2019s not too sharp. But I never used to think of him like that, or rather he didn\u2019t used to sound like this.) \n\nI do remember that he started acting very strangely around about 2019 shortly before having a mental breakdown (when he was in high school and had started smoking pot, he was already acting strangely, but around 2019 I\u2019m talking about like leaving cum around the apartment complex, that sort of thing. My therapist called CPS when I was a freshman because of this.)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16ndiua)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.99963725}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.2180668}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -2.3738894}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.435161}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.694055}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.9542518}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -4.628528}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -4.9825206}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.497495}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.530044}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -6.588077}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.7764163}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.8096423}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -6.827413}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -6.9504046}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.312549}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -7.7581286}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.807056}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.816814}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -7.853435}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0023060774}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.776964}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -7.6086025}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.238682}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -8.912544}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -9.474745}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -10.065037}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -10.984949}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -11.066803}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -11.117569}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.421873}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -11.505224}, {"token": "CP", "logprob": -11.5663395}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -11.682354}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -12.178144}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -12.372475}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -12.431377}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -12.499914}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -12.571505}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.767118}]}}

{"submission": "Hello guys, I do know cognitive fonctions and I can relatively type others correctly, but I weirdly can\u2019t with myself. Sometimes, it\u2019s because I am biased by other test results, sometimes because my mood is low or high, sometimes because of my level of energy and etc\u2026 I first thought I was INFP, then ENFP and then I thought I had more extroverted feeling so INFJ. I even thought I was ENTP for a while. I would really appreciate if you guys give me your thoughts on the things about myself I am about to write. :)\n\nSo, I\u2019ll just trow some random things:\n\n\nIt\u2019s an hard exercise, because I can\u2019t say I really know myself. I am pretty much always self conscious in public. I always worry of the things others could think about me, and I wish for them to like me or find me beautiful, even though I find myself stupid for it. Of course, nobody can always appreciate you, and that\u2019s fine. I just have an hard time accepting this. When I\u2019m overwhelmed by it, I try to just come back to center and appreciate being alive and well. I look at nature in awe and suddenly, it\u2019s fine whatever people think about me. They are the main character of their own life, and so am I. I just need to focus on me and my close ones.\n\nI am pretty hard on myself for the work I do. I am never satisfied when it\u2019s me who does it. I work as a graphic designer, and I am always very stressed of the possibility people don\u2019t like the product they paid for. It can really make me overthink.\n\nWhen I have a stressful event that is coming, I tend to overthink it so much and it\u2019s hard to detach myself from it. I analyze what could happen wrong and how people would juge me, for example. The thing is, I don\u2019t know if this is social anxiety or anxiety mixed with extroverted feeling?\n\nI can read if people are feeling off in an instant. The vibe of the group is pretty well palpable to me. However, I prefer working alone, on my own ideas, so that everything goes like the perfect idea I had in mind. I do have unrealistic expectations, mostly about my work and myself. I tend to visualize the perfect results that could happen bit most of the time, it doesn\u2019t go like this and I make mistakes, then change it but sometimes feel really disappointed of what I made.\n\nIf for example, me and a group of friends are talking about choosing a restaurant to eat, I would let other people chose first. It\u2019s important to me that they have a good time, that they are enjoying themselves and that they appreciate me. However, I don\u2019t put others needs first most of the time. I do the things I like even if other people could find it weird, because even if I am pretty scared of the jugement of others, I would never sacrifice my happiness in life for them. Well, I hope not.\n\nI like to be in nature and I like to admire the beauty of life and everything. Music can really transport me somewhere else. That is actually why I love movies and books. I can live another life for a moment and it feels good.\n\nI kinda have a \u201cpattern\u201d for most occasions. The minute I hear a Christmas music and imagine the snow falling outside, I feel Christmas. The moment I smell the Fall coming it\u2019s another world I am in\uff0e\n\nI like to take things slow and rest and play most of the time. I am not someone who cares that much about getting things done. I like living slowly and yes, maybe I am lazy. For me, watching a movie, listening to music or reading a book can never be a waste of time. Having a successful life, to me, is reaching peace and having admire the beauty and the chance you got to exist. I am rereading and i know i am kinda cringy, I\u2019m sorry about that. I just want to be honest.\nEven though I am always pretty worried of the close future, I try not to think too far and see where life goes at the moment\n\nI like to try solving complex problems and having the results after is always so satisfying. I have opinions that are quite unique on the world but that are still shaped by the point of view of others mixed with my values. I do enjoy having debates, especially philosophical ones. I don\u2019t like to admit it but I kind of want to make others think like me sometimes. However, I will never puch too much and if someone looks hurt, I will stop talking.\n\nI can zone out quite easily sometimes.\n\nSo I guess that is pretty it. Sorry if it was cringe again and very long. :)\n\nIf you could take a guess I would be really grateful, thank you in avance! <3", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.4201038}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.277499}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -3.1657035}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -3.9433143}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -6.5879564}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.5891676}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -8.4983015}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.641732}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.156728}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.433064}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -9.755395}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.116925}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -10.228749}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -11.003169}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -11.150195}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -11.683177}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.886661}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -12.252961}, {"token": "My", "logprob": -12.398402}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -12.555827}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -2.1650272e-05}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.065944}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -12.527755}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.554332}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -15.067002}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -15.426698}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -16.334715}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -16.412445}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -16.581356}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -17.507998}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -17.63886}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -17.647152}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -17.885355}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -18.194616}, {"token": "FF", "logprob": -18.311356}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -18.653023}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -18.812513}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -18.893665}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -18.901127}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -19.051687}]}}
{"submission": "I learned about mbti a long time ago and I've never been able to type myself i feel like I fit all functions and all types somehow so I want to describe myself because I don't change a lot but i know mbti can't change but I do change a lot ! \n\nSo first as a kid (from like 4 to 10)  I was known as the one who don't talk like i could talk but i just would not do it even with my siblings, I was a always on my own, at school I actually had some friends, I was seen by others as cute & nice & shy, I don't remember much from my childhood externally but internally I remember having very early a huge inner world filled with thoughts and feelings of all sorts, I was also known as someones who follows the rules and who is smart, I was already having lots of existential crisis like every night and would always wonder about the future and about life and about people and society and about everything and would feel inadequate in general like inadequate in my family and city. \n\nThen Teenager (10-18) I became different I was way more externally focused, much more focused, I was very focused about school and was the only think i could think about, school school school, grades grades grades, I just wanted to be the best and was starting to feel the pressure of how others people see me and the pressure of having the opportunities i want, I became much much more talkative and active and was thinking about the future but much more practical and serious than before (but its something that actually stress me a lot idk if its my natural personality or something i'm forced to be well to live correctly), I was very pragmatic and logical but also very feisty, my siblings always laught about how i evolved because i went from never talking and extremely calm and phlegmatic to talking very directly and trying to control everything which is a personality that even during it I felt trapped into for me it's just a personality that i think i have to adopt to \"survive\" in the world but It dont feel like me, at the same time I also had a \"hidden personality\" that no ones knows about, behind the surface IM EXTREMELY SOFT, I cry all the time and feel nostalgia and sadness and bittersweetness about life and people and existence and myself and i'm unsure and confused and fearful and I feel small but I don't show that side of me sometimes not even to myself but weirdly it feels like the most authentic one but I show this side of me that never cries and never fall because i'm scared of being vulnerable in front of others, I mistrust people a lot even as a child and don't like being seen as little and stupid, i hate being seen as stupid. \n\nMe now (19 turning 20) I'm just a little bit more self aware and detached from the personality of me teenager I recognize sometimes I was very dramatic in my \"seriousness\" and I try to reconnect with my real self but I think I will always keep a part of that \"coldness\" and professional I developed in my teenage years but I want the calmness and chillness I had as a child but i'm still stuck in that cycle of adopting a personality that I think will lead me to success and safety rather than the one that feels real and healthy \n\nAlso random fact that can help :\n\n\\-  I'm very focus on knowledge I love learning about things especially philosophy and science and religion discussion and anything brain related or social issues or psychology I like to known about the world around me.\n\nAnyway I hope someone can enlighten me, you can ask questions if you want more precisions but personally i'm super lost !

{"submission": " \n\n***\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.***\n\n24, male\n\n***\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?***\n\nanxiety, taking pills for that condition\n\n***\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?***\n\nI grew up in a secular middle-class family in a quiet suburban area, My parents had a divorce when I was in middle school and since then I live with my mother. I would say that the area I lived in caused me to live in some kind of a bubble of safetiness from what I consider the 'outside world' which probably one of the reasons im more anxious regarding new experiences outside my town.\n\n***\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?***\n\ncurrently not working. My previous work was an office-job which I grew tired of it after a month or so because of how dull and boring at was alongside taking time away from my free time at home. I didn't like having to do something which I don't like and how the higher ups pushed me to 'think big' or 'do more than minimum required ' while I also had to do the job of 3 people and all of my coworkers were about 20 years older than me so I just isolated at break time by either working, eating alone or just spending some time outside until it's time to go back. I would like a job that doesn't take away from my free time and if it includes working with people then people who are my age and with similar interests which I can connect and spend time with.\n\n***\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?***\n\nhard to say if i'll feel refreshed since I think im tired almost all the time - but I do prefer my alone time than spending or sharing my physical space with others - it's been a long time since I shared it with my irl friends and while it can feel lonely it's not something I can't deal with or on average prefer to spending it mostly with others. \n\n***\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?***\n\nWhen I was young I used to play football ( soccer for americans ) and I can say I loved it - after I quit playing it's just hard to get back because it's just not fun playing sports if u are not in shape and I don't like the feeling of exhaustion where you barely have any room to breath. I would say that currently I prefer indoor activities like gaming, watching shows or listening to podcasts and interesting youtube essays, music is also great if it sounds nice or im able to create imaginary scenarios or scenes by listening to it ( which I can also do without it ) and I would say that the only outside activities I may like are walking probably ( which I don't really do much ) .\n\n***\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?***\n\nHard to say. Im curious about what initially catches my attention and I find it may be interesting for me to check it out. I would say my curiosities are more aligned with true crime, politics (when im in the mood ) basketball and such. I also like creating shows in my head which may be based on things I like like anime or other kinds of media and then make a plot and characters which might be 'inspired' by it but not exactly the same. I like true crime because of the mystery and the scary elements it brings with it - I also liked creepypastas in the past but no longer listen to many of them because they are made up and fore me it takes the scary element because it's not real.\n\n***\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?***\n\nDefinitely not. I hate responsibility and I would hate being the one who is most responsible who also give orders to others to accomplish and I fear failing and then the entire or most of the blame will be on me and that my incompetence or lack of ability will be shown on stage as like a way of people to mock me. I would say that if I still had to be a leader I would look to see what is going to work. I think the first things we would need to establish are teamwork, chemistry, knowledge of people's strengths and weaknesses and so on. It will be good to have a good and positive environment which will help people feel more comfortable in the work place and will probably also lead to more productivity and happiness. I think that many of the things that could help a project or a business be successful depends on the morale and the chemistry of the workers - so as such I would like to be able to keep it high to reach the needed results. Tho as I said before - I wouldn't want to be a leader and I don't think i'll be a good at it - but if I needed to then this is the way I would go with probably.\n\n***\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?***\n\nI think I am somewhat clumsy. Can't really say much aside from that despite I had some experience with playing guitar and football I still kind of awkward when we talk about physical activities. I feel like that mostly because I remember a lot of times where I just struggled in doing something physical that others didn't struggle with but I guess it's kind of hard for me to elaborate on that.\n\n***\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.***\n\nwell - depends on the art. art as like drawing? no, im terrible at that, but I think im quite good in the musical sense of art tho it's been years since I played guitar or sang. I was on a choir in middle school and I eventually quit it cause it wasn't what I expected and it took time away from my freetime and I hated some of the things I had to go through or learn like music theory. I can appreciate art for what it tries to convey and the messages it might want to send with it - tho im really not someone you'll find in a museoum looking at them.\n\n***\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?***\n\npast - well my only relation with my past is obviously some memories or experiences and things that I might encounter which reminds me of things I've encountered or experienced before. ex: going to a place I used to go to and maybe some memories will come up. How I deal with it? I don't really know - it can make me somewhat depressive in some ways when I get nostalgic. I will also say that I don't have much of an attachment of objects from the past just because they are from the past or have some memory connected to them.\n\npresent - kind of hard to talk about the present amirite? it's just what is happening right now - and the concept of living in the present always kinda of sounded weird to me. I would say that the present is the best time because it's the one I have the most control over - the past already happened and there is nothing I can do about it aside from not let it shape completely who I am and it also has the power to change and shape the way my future would look like. So I guess the present is the time when you are in the strongest and it will be the most healthy way to live because that will eventually decide what your future gonna be like. Now how I actually deal with it? probably by doing nothing which is something I need to improve on cause im just not that action-oriented and im more passive.\n\nfuture - I think some of the things I could say about the future I already said on the present part but I would say the future (or should I say the imaginary view of your future ) is also important so you could know what kind of person you wanna be and what kind of life you wanna live - you need to have that direction so you'll know what to do at the present time to achieve that goal. Now, how I actually deal with it? by just not doing what I said here lmao. while I have my goals they are not that practical or concrete and it just some kind of an ideal life I want to have with myself without knowing a way I could achieve that - and im too lazy to actually put it to work - but it's also something I want to improve.\n\n***\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?***\n\nI guess it depends on who. I think in all cases I'll try to help but my attitude would depend on who is asking it. If it's someone with an authority or power over me I would be much more negative towards them and i'll find it annoying - if it's with random people I don't mind helping tho it obviously depends on what kind of help they want from me and if I can even help them with it.\n\n***\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?***\n\nI guess? what does it actually mean? (if someone can elaborate on it)  I know I don't want logical INCONSISTENCY in my life since it could make stuff much messier and question my reality so I think that some consistency wouldn't hurt here.\n\n***\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?***\n\nIt's not really important to me. It is something I will need to improve since as an adult it is something you have to develop but inside me  I really don't care about being productive - all I care about and want is to live my life doing the things I want to do for fun and care less about a career or social achievements and such. I just wanna have a good time.\n\n***\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?***\n\nNo. I might give advices to friends and such when I see them struggle with something ( like a level in a game and such ) but im definitely not controlling and I kind off being put off by people like that. Just like I said regarding the leadership question - I don't wanna be responsible for other people unless there is really no other option.\n\n***\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?***\n\nGaming, watching movies/shows, create imaginary scenarios or scenes, listening to music, listening/watching podcasts or essays/videos on youtube, reading on forums like reddit and such or twitter,sleeping and reading about MBTI. Why I like them? that's an hard question - but I guess those are the things that I find the most fun in and I get least tired of. For me it's all about whether a certain activity gives me a sense of fun or not - If I feel engaged and interested then it will my hobby. Sometimes I can obsess over something until I get tired of it and find something else to obsess over and sometimes I come back to get the old-new feeling until I ged tired of it again.\n\n***\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?***\n\nHard for me to answer about a specific type of learning style so i'll just talk about the environment - for me the kind of environment which I will struggle with the most is the kind of the typical school environment where u just copy something that is on the board and there is nothing else - my most favorite teachers were the ones who tried to either involve other things that not necessairly related ( like lets say - talking about aliens ) or let us watch movies or shows that might be connected to what we are studying. I think it's less about memorization, logic or the other stuff and more about how engaged and how fun I think the way they teach.\n\n***\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?***\n\nim not the strategizing type. I think I just do what I gotta do? I read the instructions on how the project should be and then do it according to that, and that's if im not getting lazy and not finishing it at all cause it's too boring.\n\n***\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?***\n\nwhat I want in life is pretty simple but also kinda complicated too - my aspiration is to just be happy and live life the way I want to be. I want to live in a quiet and a peaceful place where I can feel safe and out of harm way and also be able to connect with people I find fun to spend time with. I want to be able to do what I love without the restrictions of work culture or the rat race we all need to participate in cause that's what we are told.\n\nI don't really care about any career and anyway it's hard for me to imagine restricting myself to one kind of work which i'll have to do until I die ( well unless it's the type of job which gives me the freedom I want ) but I was never the type to be able to decide or aim on one specific career.\n\n***\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?***\n\nI have many fears - I would say that one of the main ones are people. Im afraid of people and their intentions. Im afraid of the things that can go wrong because of one crazy person or one scam I might fall into because I was careless.\n\nim also afraid of death - it's seems so surreal to me that life will just be over at one point and that I won't exist, won't be able to think or dream - just nothing will happen and it just makes me depressed sometimes thinking about it.\n\nIm afraid of physical experiences and im closed to experiencing new places and such - on vacations im more of an hotel guy than the one who travels around and it's because I see it as an uncomfortable experience which im not used to or just don't find to my liking. I would be pretty stressful being forced into that kind of situation.\n\n***\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?***\n\nIm happy, cheerful, playful and kind of childish. I tease my friends and being a chaotic troll who just likes having fun activities with others. Things seem hopeful and im optimistic about where im at. I can also be quite open to help or advise people who ask me for help regarding stuff and I feel like im some kind of an entertaining machine.\n\n***\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?***\n\nIm closed off, Isolated from others, depressed, too serious to the point I might find the kind of fun and childish which im not part of as annoying and something that needs to stop, I might become some kind of authority who calls out people for what they do, I become more emotionally unstable and paranoid about the intentions of people and what they might feel or think about me and I question it. I feel like there is no hope and that I might not wanna get rid of my sadness or anger.\n\n***\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?***\n\nI think I can daydream pretty often but also most of my activities are tied to the real world so when im preoccupied with them it's hard to be disconnected from reality. I think I do pay attention to what's around me but I think it's also a result of the environment which makes me feel alerted (for many reasons I won't specify here just shitty situation ) so I kinda have to pay attention to what's around me and to look everywhere - tho I have the moments of signing out if im in an environment I feel it's safe but I don't think it's to the point of being completely disconnected.\n\n***\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?***\n\nwhile if it wasn't part of my imagination I would think about what am I doing in such a boring,blank and empty room \ud83d\ude02 but to answer seriously, I think i'll just make up scenarios in my head which will help me pass the time or think about things that happend - or do the logical thing and quit imagining such a boring scenario like being in an empty room.\n\n***\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?***\n\nim quite indecisive even regarding unimportant decisions - I just don't like deciding on things, and it mostly takes someone to push me in order to make a decision. now, that's if I don't have any strong feelings or thought about it - I definitely know what I DON'T wanna do but I also find it hard deciding on something that I might regret later. And coming back to it - I did change my mind A LOT of times regarding a decision I made- either by myself or by the influence of others - it just makes you go 'what if I did that or that' and that is consistent with my life.\n\n***\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?***\n\nemotions probably influenced a lot of my more negative actions and memories. I remember how many times they took over me in the past and how I did things I regret and im still ashamed of them because of how I wasn't able to control them back then. I don't know how to describe the process of my emotions - but I would say that once I start feeling something that bothers me because of something that someone said and such I try to control it and keep it inside and not let it take over. Based on all this information I would say that emotions are quite important in my life because they definitely were a force I needed to deal with and also learning to control them and not let everything people might say to offend me personally and such. There is still more work to be done but I think im quite fine where im at.\n\n***\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?***\n\nnot really, while I don't like arguments cause I can get quite emotional (and it's embarrasing ) I still go into them unwillingly cause I have something to say. Now Im able to control myself much better but if you'll ask my opinion for someone then I will answer it even if it goes against yours. I wouldn't agree on something I just don't agree with just to appease someone - it sounds ridiculous to me and it's also kind of my ego so idk.\n\n***\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?***\n\nnot really, sometimes on school I skipped some classes or gone out of school when wanted us to stay inside ( even if a class was cancelled ) and I also remember one instance of stealing some football cards from someone which I never returned, so you could say it's some kind of rule breaking but I will never do something serious that I think will have great consequences. I would say that I also got used to some rules to the point it might look ridiculous to some people like not crossing the crossroad no matter what if it doesn't show green light.\n\nI think authority should be challenged because they have the power for good or bad so they should be put into place or question when they are wrong or abusing their powers. Just because someone is high in the hierarchy ( which is concept I dislike honestly ) doesn't mean they deserve it or that they are better than others or can't be wrong - and anyway their power should be limited by the people and other forces.\n\nas I said before - I break rules when I think that the consequences aren't too great, justified and could be explainable and seem logical to the normal person.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": "ISFP", "logprobs": {"IS": [{"token": "IS", "logprob": -0.8490103}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -1.3945024}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.8572118}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -2.5744836}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -3.0097082}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.919462}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -4.258112}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -5.9221783}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.0396023}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.341446}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.376913}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -7.628208}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.744444}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.9907875}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -8.001938}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.038269}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -8.4477215}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -8.865765}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -9.030071}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -9.038212}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.059648287}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -2.8544176}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -8.302523}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.267242}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -11.714678}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.031925}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.374765}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -12.861832}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -13.298779}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.601812}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.623932}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.471403}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -14.626812}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -14.698309}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -15.040213}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -15.112347}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -15.3691845}, {"token": "xxx", "logprob": -15.476587}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -15.5442705}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -15.568575}]}}
{"submission": "\u2022 **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm 26 years old and female. I'm 5'2 and petite/normal skinny? If that makes sense lol. I'm Korean American. I have long black hair I usually tie back in a low ponytail. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI used to be diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PTSD. I took meds for these however I've been off meds for over 2 years and off therapy for almost a year as well. I definitely feel like I'm in a great place in my life and moving forward. \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was somewhat religious. My mom is a strong Christian believer whereas my dad is atheist and pretty much \"anti christian.\" (He makes fun of it often) My family dynamic growing up was not perfect but not as bad as some have it. My family however fought constantly growing up. Lots of yelling, screaming, sometimes throwing things on the floor, etc. However I feel like everyone has matured so much and the family is not like it was then. I did have issues with feeling like the black sheep of the family. I was picked on alot by the family which made me develop self esteem issues however it's something I'm working on and have forgiven. \n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI'm currently a CNA. I did it to gain experience before I start nursing. (starting in January yay!) It helped me get through my depression and I feel like I really found my passion in helping people. Before being a CNA I studied music at Berklee college of music. I really enjoyed that but my direction in life changed as I got older and I wanted something more balanced..aka more stability along with the passion. \n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nIf I had to spend an entire weekend by myself I think I might feel relaxed at first but then sad. I live with people right now so I feel like it's hard to imagine that. Even though we don't talk much I can't say what it'd be like being completely alone. I also have a puppy who truly makes me so happy. I would definitely be sad not having him sleep or cuddle next to me. \n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI love to sing and play guitar. I also love binging shows and getting lost in the pointless youtube shorts which go on and on. I like dance but haven't started it yet but haven't had the chance to go to lessons because of how busy I am with working towards my nursing path right now. I tend to enjoy both indoor and outdoor activities. I do still have some social anxiety due to low self esteem so it can be difficult for me to sometimes be outside hanging out and about but I find when I do I'm much happier and generally don't regret it. Staying inside is more comfortable but also less fulfilling/more sad most times.\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI'm definitely a curious person and I have more ideas than I execute. It's something I'm working on. Hence me streamlining my goals into one at the moment which is nursing. My curiosities tend to be about the human mind and why people act the way they do. This probably is why I'm so fascinated by murder documentaries lol. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI don't enjoy taking on leadership positions. I tend to view authority as needing to be stern with others. That's not the person I like to be even though I believe that is a necessary thing. I think I could do it and actually it might be beneficial for me as it would force me to grow. But it wouldn't be comfortable. Most likely would lean towards democratic leadership. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI think I'm somewhat coordinated. I studied piano for a decade which takes a lot of coordination so I'm assuming so. But also I'm extremely clumsy and will trip over my own feet so maybe not? Not sure haha. I definitely enjoy working with my hands. Anything that lets me touch or feel different textures. I love silly putty, playing guitar, etc. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI am musically artistic. In terms of physical art I went to a painting class I bought for my mom. It was nice but mostly instructional which I liked since I didn't know where to begin. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nMy past often haunts me but I'm trying to acknowledge it and move on from it. I'm not quite satisfied with my present as I've not yet achieved my educational goals however my future holds alot of hope for me. I'm hoping that's enough to fuel me towards my end goal. \n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nDepends on the situation. Generally I don't like it. At work I am constantly asked to do miscellanous things by people that are generally lazy to do it themselves. I'll give a scenario. I'm busy with 10 different tasks which internally I'm trying to sort through and time. A nurse whose right by the water station will ask me to bring ice water to room #74. It's extremely frustrating because it makes me think, \"why can't you do this yourself?\" I tend to think what would I do in that person's shoes. I do alot for my work so it irks me when I feel like people are taking advantage of me out of their own laziness. If its my friend who I know really needs something I will generally be happy to help. My eagerness to help is good if I know that they are asking it because they truly need the help. \n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes I do. Logical consistency is allowing me to put everything into action that I want. \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nIts very important. However it's not something that comes easily to me. It's something that I've worked towards. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nDefinitely not. However, I'd say I'm definitely very controlling over myself. For example: what I do in the day, what I eat, etc. I think I'm like this because I'm a perfectionist which is fueled by insecurity most likely. \n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMusic, music, shows, hanging out with friends, etc. I like them because they help me get out into the world and escape those days when I'm having constant swirling thoughts in my head, which is pretty much all the time. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI prefer Spatial-visual learning style. I probably most struggle with purely aural learning style. I think i struggle with aural because I can get distracted or its just hard to visualize it in action which is how I best learn. I prefer classes based on logic, and creativity.  \n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nDefinitely not the best at this. I can get the steps done but it won't look so neat or clean cut like if you put those steps in an excel sheet. I tend to have a general goal and then improvise as I go. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nMy aspirations in life professionally are to become either an NP or CRNA after becoming an RN. Personally speaking I want to eventually be married, have kids, live a happy life with a family. Other stuff is icing on top of the cake but of course would love the vacations too. :p\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI currently have a fear of getting older. It makes me uncomfortable because I feel like I haven't accomplished the things I've wanted to in life yet at this point. Like having kids, or already being an RN, etc. \n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nMe being carefree and living my life to the fullest. \n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nMe being restricted and not pursing the things I want or not being able to achieve those things. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI'm hyperaware of others around me. I have had bad social anxiety before which is better because of work I've done. I think even when I do daydream I'm aware of my surroundings because of this. \n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI think about my relationship and my boyfriend. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nDepends on what it is. Truly can be really short and take forever. If it took forever then it will be hard to change my mind. If it's a short time I took I would be more willing to consider changing my mind depending on the new information. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me awhile to process my emotions because I feel alot. Emotions are very important in my life. However I try not to let them rule my decision making. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes. Sometimes I think it's not worth it to cause a disagreement. It's weighing pros vs cons. I do this at work sometimes when someone is disagreeing with something. I've seen what happens when two \"challengers\" go at it. It tends to just go no where. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't break rules often. I don't think they should be challenged because in the end it would mostly hurt me. However they should do better and know that there are always improvements to be made.

Me telling them what to do upsets them\n\n- I desire to be very fair to everyone, regardless of how close they are to me. I want everyone to get equal opportunities in accordance to the work they have put in\n\n- In social settings,  I am usually quiet and introspective, sometimes getting lost in thought from staring into the distance. However, I do engage conversation if I feel others are not putting as much effort into it.\n\n- When I see people who would considered low on, say, a societal heirarchy, I distance myself from them and it motivates me to do even more so I don\u2019t end up like them. This has been a great motivator so far.\n\n- External validation, from authoritative figures makes me happy\n\n- Whenever I feel bad about not being good at something, I immediately set it as a goal in my head that, in this timeframe, I have to achieve this objective. For example, I may look a little chubby and set an objective that I must achieve it. I feel terrible if I can\u2019t achieve it in time.\n\n- People often tell me I seem serious and angry alot of times, but I find that to be not the case. I am really in a good mood most of the times\n\n- I can be very anxious about not reaching my goals in time. I do tend to procrastinate and regret it later.\n\n- I love taking care of the people around me, not emotionally, but practically. I help them with their life with clear direct actions. I am bad at providing emotional support.\n\n- I can read people really well, I understand the motivations behind their actions and why they do certain things in their own way. It can make me sympathise with the person more and I will offer them help, however if they neglect the help I gave, I can be hard on them.\n\n- I am very socially cut off at times, I neglect my relationships for other impersonal pursuits. This can end up making me lonely.\n\n- I have a very blunt, sarcastic humor that upsets alot of people.\n\n- I am good at \u2018faking\u2019 myself, or lying about myself so others perceive me as a better person.\n\n- I may be classified as a \u2018healthy narcissist\u2019, as I have high self confidence but I care about others too.\n\n- I like when people rely on me for something and I don\u2019t like taking things from them as it makes me feel weak.\n\n- I am spiritual, but not religious\n\n- I am very imaginative at times, envisioning how things could play out in the future. It can make me dreamy and impractical.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about my lifestyle:\n\n\u2022 I drink green tea everyday.\n\n\u2022 I meditate everyday.\n\n\u2022 I exercise 6 days a week.\n\n\u2022 My room can be very messy at times.\n\n\nMy personal philosophy:\n\n\nI believe the best course of action in life is to do what will benefit you and the people around you the most. Everything we do, it is a choice that we choose to make, even if we do nothing about our problems, it is still a choice that we consciously made.\n\nI believe in every tough situation, we have the capability to overcome it with enough time and effort. The limits of the human spirit can be frightening. Every human has the capability to make the most out of at-least one aspect of their life.\nThis world has been systemized in a way that only the strong come on out on top, and whether you like it or not, this is reality and you must accept and embrace it, unless you are happy in a low position in life.\n\nThere is nothing truly impossible, unless it contradicts the laws of physics. We must set unrealistic and grand goals to get it done.\nWe would have never gone to the moon in 1969, if NASA scientists believed it to be impossible. You must see your goal as the moon as such. Give it your all no matter how many mistakes you make, how much time it takes, you are guaranteed to reach it if you never give up. And I believe, at some 80% of our own life, which is purely personal and dictated by our mind, is in our control. By truly mastering yourself, you master the world. \n\nAfter having dealt with trauma and depression myself, I have realized the ultimate goal of life is to maximise positivity and minimise negativity, for others an for yourself. Whether it\u2019s by pursuing goals, spending time with the people you love, or simply doing your own thing; you must push yourself to be truly content in life.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16obxhc)", "clean_guess": "ENTJ", "llm_guess": "ENTJ", "logprobs": {"ENT": [{"token": "ENT", "logprob": -0.5456318}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -2.011313}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -2.248734}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -2.4894147}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -3.5663571}, {"token": " ENT", "logprob": -3.8495889}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -4.279404}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -4.4112573}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -4.9487386}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -5.4974885}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -6.542647}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -6.5603967}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -6.5826592}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -6.665116}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.236214}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -7.3734593}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.5954537}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.8188157}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.908608}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -8.051609}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.00047416388}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -7.6607504}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.085069}, {"token": "RE", "logprob": -15.080798}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.162047}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -16.743296}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -16.810057}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -16.885717}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -16.892271}, {"token": "JI", "logprob": -17.129976}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -17.3861}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -17.459297}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -17.467888}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -17.661972}, {"token": "JS", "logprob": -17.91482}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -17.970787}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -18.121607}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -18.335087}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -18.392424}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -18.412668}]}}
{"submission": "1) Context:\na) What is your age range and general location (Country so that cultural values can be taken into account)?

I'm an atheist and a left-leaning centrist.\n\nb) Which types are you currently considering? Why are you considering them and why haven't you decided on one?\n\n> ESFJ, ISFJ, and ENFJ. I've been considering them since those are my results in two tests I've taken (typologycentral and mistype investigator). I haven't decided on one yet since tests aren't really accurate.\n\n2) What do you deem as your purpose in life?\n\n> Meeting people and making relationships with them and taking care of my boyfriend.\n\n3) Of the seven deadly sins, which one(s) do you relate to the most and the least and why?\n\n> I relate the most to wrath, since I usually get angry when under stress, I do try to repress this, however, so I don't affect anyone.\n\n4) Analyzing your relationships with others, briefly describe:\na) The type of people you are drawn to\n\n> I'm usually drawn to people who have the same skills as mine, like in mathematics, so we can get along better.\n\nb) The type of people who are drawn to you\n\n> People who want to make friendships are usually drawn to me, maybe because I'm nice to others and like to have fun.\n\nc) The type of people you are repulsed by\n\n> I'm repulsed by people who are mean because they don't care about others' feelings. I'm also repulsed by people who blame their problems on other people rather than solving or accepting it.\n\n5)What are the traits in others that you admire but you cannot emulate yourself? Elaborate.\n\n> Creativity, since I don't have the ability to create ideas on my own. I admire the trait since it seems fun to be able to create your own ideas.\n\n6) Describe your relationship with the following:\na) Anger\n\n> I used to get angry a lot when someone doesn't empathize or a problem is hard to solve.

I also feel passion when I do my favorite activities like sports since they mean a lot to me.\n\ne) Conflict\n\n> When there is conflict, I try to make sure to solve them so they get done already.

A struggle you've been unable to conquer, ect)?\n\n> A theme that played a prominent role in my life is understanding others. I used to have a hard time understanding and empathizing with people, especially my boyfriend. Because of this, when I get angry, I hurt others' emotions.

Because of that, I started empathizing with people more.\n\n8) b) What do you plan on studying/working as in the future? How did you go about deciding this? If this is not your ideal area of pursuit, what would be? \n\n> I plan to become an engineer, an Electrical Engineer to be specific.

I also focus on how fun they are since I'm not a big fan of boring people who would drain me instead.\n\n10) How do you feel about humanity as a whole? What do you feel are some of the biggest problems the human race faces and why?\n\n> I believe there is still hope for humanity and time for them to develop. Like during the 1900s, LGBT people are less accepted and now, they are more accepted so I do think there's hope for them to understand more issues as long as we give them time.\n\nThe biggest problem the human race faces is ignorance. I see so many people being ignorant about minorities, climate change, etc. Because of these, these problems become hard to solve.\n\n11) What are some of your hobbies and interests?\n\n> I like sports a lot, especially swimming because it energizes me a lot and I like moving around.\n\nI also like fashion and personal care (like skincare) since I like looking good, not to impress others though, I just like myself looking aesthetically pleasing and well-groomed.\n\n13) How do you usually hang out with your friend(s)?

{"submission": "So, for a while, I have been comparing the cognitive function to what I am and for some reason, when it comes to Ti, Fi, Ne, Fe and Ni, it feels as though they all call to me. I\u2019ve read them in depth and for some reason it feels like all of them are me when I know that it isn\u2019t true. I know that I am a XnfX but so far I don\u2019t know which one. \n\nSo I am a day dreamer, I get caught up in my mind even though to others, it would seem as though i am in the present. I do think with my heart and tend to lead with that, but I do also weigh my options before doing so. I am pretty firm on my beliefs of the world and people. I don\u2019t like seeing oppression, nor do I like seeing someone get bullied. I tend to stand up for that person if it does happen. I am pretty emotional I cry at movies and over animals. I am socially anxious and tend to get caught up in my mind. I tend to rehearse conversations before they happen. I am into astrology and psychology a lot I want to understand people and I want to be understood. I like going out and I love traveling. I also like to think of random theories and talk about them with friends. I love self help books that help me understand myself and people more. I also end up talking to my friends about it when I give them advice so they can start healing the root cause. I\u2019m a social chameleon\nand i tend to be extroverted with some and introverted with others. I also know myself but I don\u2019t at the same time. It feels like because I change myself to fit others so much that I lose myself. When i meet new people i have to watch them first then I approach them or they approach me. \n\nLast but not least I really resonate with INFP characters. Wall-e was a movie that felt like I was watching the inner me on the screen. That movie makes me have an emotional breakdown because his whole life he was alone and once he felt a connection for the first time all he wanted was to nurture it but was with someone that used him.

{"submission": "\u2022 Well to start of with I play video games almost daily, most hours of my week compared to other activities. However, I play them for becoming better / competitively. So I usually avoid single player games as it doesn\u2019t provide competition, but I used to be heavily into them.\n\n\u2022 I want to learn and know stuff, but I usually find it troublesome to get into it. Worse when trying to maintain it.\n\n\u2022 Quite anti-social. I am usually the lone wolf when it comes to anything. People are not my thing. So I am indeed am introvert. I can however interact and socialise but cannot relate or understand their point of view without adding logic or reasoning. So I tend to be frowned on due to my thinking.

However, that is only if I am interested in the subject at hand. \n\n\u2022 I believe I am both worse and better than everyone and anyone. If I were to study, I learn things fast so I know more than them faster, causing my ego to inflate. Although if someone is better than me I will be envious of their knowledge / experience, thus leading to a need to be better than them. During this time I feel constantly inferior to them.

{"submission": "Hey folks, I'm having trouble deciding if I've been mistyping myself as an INFP 4-fix for the last few years. I had previously typed myself as an INFJ 2-fix for a long time. I'm pretty sure I'm a 9, and I have a 6-fix and am sp/so.\n\n**\\~ How old are you?

I prefer this to having a good, chill time, and then being resentful when I have to live alongside people again.\n\n**\\~ What is your relation with movement and your surroundings?** \n\nI try my best to move and place things in safe, smooth, energy-saving ways. But I still just can never truly grasp how things move through physical space.\n\n\\~ **How curious are you?**\n\nToo curious, according to previous therapists who wanted me to stop caring about where my emotions came from and why. Not curious enough, according to an INFJ 6 relative who questions me about things I've already decided I know enough about.\n\n**\\~ What are your curiosities about?**\n\nMainly, why people do things and what they feel about it, and the same regarding myself. I can go down research rabbit holes about anything, but I'll burn out fast if it isn't something I can intellectually \"play with\".\n\n\\~ **Do you have more ideas then you can execute?**\n\nAll the time.\n\n\\~ **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position?**\n\nNo.\n\n**\\~ What would your leadership style be?** \n\nDemocratic.\n\n\\~ **Are you coordinated?**\n\nIn dance only.\n\n\\~ **Describe your art?**\n\nCharacter-driven stories and colorful visuals.\n\n\\~ **Please describe what forms of art you enjoy.**\n\nFantasy, music with funky beats, maximalistic visuals, emotional music, stories where characters have to make sacrifices for psychological development (for better or worse).\n\n\\~ **What's your opinion about the past?**\n\nEither an unwelcome reminder, a treasure trove of lessons, or a source of idyllic nostalgia.\n\n**\\~ Present?**\n\nShould stop bothering me.\n\n**\\~ Future?**\n\nTerrifying.\n\n**\\~ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)?**\n\nIf the requests involves emotional support or exposure to really sad things, panic because my hyperempathy will overwhelm me.\n\n**\\~ If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nWhy would I *not* want to help people?\n\n**\\~ Do you need logical consistency in your life? How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nSee, the problem is, I presume to value both of these things.\n\n**\\~ Do you control others, even if indirectly?**\n\nI do not have this skill.\n\n**\\~ What are your hobbies?**\n\nPrivate storymaking, getting in touch with my emotions via music, psychologically analyzing myself/others, writing fanfiction (takes effort and courage), gaming (multiplayer takes effort). The protagonist of my private story is ESFP 874 sx/so. I am vicariously set free through her. She isn't obsessed with being a good vs. bad person, isn't plagued with anxiety over everything, and lives with as much passion as she can. But, she shares my fixation over being a strong vs. weak person.\n\n**\\~ Why do you like the\\[se hobbies\\]?**\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\n**\\~ What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most?**\n\nEnvironments where I am being judged for my competence by people who are demonstrating competence. So, all jobs.\n\n**\\~ Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nCreativity for sure.\n\n**\\~ Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks?**\n\nNot at all.\n\n**\\~ Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n**\\~ What's important to you and why?**\n\n1. Being a stable, put-together, admirable person.\n2. Being a strong, enduring, admirable person.\n3. Being a kind, ethical, admirable person.\n\nI've failed at all three.\n\n**\\~ What are your aspirations?**\n\nBecoming as self-actualized as I can be within the constraints of my limits and environmental limits. Which is generally on the backburner in favor of the battle between my pursuit of instant gratification vs. environmental/bodily demands.\n\n**\\~ What are your fears?**\n\nWhy, you want to take me down?\n\n\\~ **What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate?**\n\nYou can be triggered by and hate *anything* if you're not a coward. */meme*\n\n**\\~ What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nChasing magical solutions to my problems that inevitably don't actually fix everything.\n\n**\\~ What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nExplosive emotions for which I have to withdraw and be even more inactive, or else they will all spill out, and then I will be extremely bothered by them and their consequences.\n\n**\\~ Do you daydream often?**\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n**\\~ Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. What do you think about?**\n\nWhatever I was just thinking about.\n\n**\\~ How long do you take to make an important decision?**\n\nEither as long a time as I can get away with, or as short a time as I can get away with.\n\n**\\~ And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nEasily, unless my values led to the decision.\n\n**\\~ How long do you take to process your emotions?**\n\nWhat does that even mean? I'm *always* processing my emotions.\n\n**\\~ How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nThey're one of my special interests, along with storymaking and personality.\n\n**\\~ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going?**\n\nAbsolutely. For ethical and political matters, though, I have to be feeling especially bothered or insecure to stay quiet.\n\n**\\~ Why?**\n\nWhy bother myself with strife unless I know it's unlikely to have consequences?\n\n**\\~ Do you break rules often?**\n\nYes. I prioritize acting according to my morals and I expect others to act according to theirs. If there's a problem, I expect them to speak up about whether my behavior is socially sound. So, I end up not remembering or even noticing other kinds of rules, especially unspoken ones, or reports of me breaking such rules that do not include interpersonal concerns. I need to pay attention more to rules and standards even when someone isn't directly telling me how they're hurt, where the moral misalignment lies, or what my role as a group member is. This is, unfortunately, complicated by my autism.\n\nThings work out better when people come talk to me with the hope that I have the potential to sync with them / the group, and the desire for mutual understanding, rather than suddenly deciding to spout judgments at me one day, or else I will *never* feel comfortable with that person/group again. I realize this is a personality difference and is not likely to be something I can just not be biased over, even though I wish for tolerance and appreciation of all personalities in theory.\n\n**\\~ Do you think authority should be challenged?**\n\nAbsolutely. I lack skill in this area, so I instead state or show I'm in opposition to an authority that isn't present.\n\n**\\~ If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nMy mindset is: If the rule isn't about directly preventing people from getting hurt, does it really matter all that much? *Sorry, 1s & SJs...*\n\n**\\~ What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nChilling, vibing, having fun, communal living, showing regular mutual appreciation, doing what you what when you want how you want where you want, not needing to constantly stave off overwhelm.\n\n...\n\nThe fact that this questionnaire barely asked me about my emotions makes me sad. They are sad and want attention.\n\n* **Sorrow:** A frequent visitor\n* **Shame:** The loudest, most demanding one\n* **Guilt:** The secondmost demanding one\n* **Envy:** The Problem Child^(TM), but also a gateway to confidence\n* **Moral Disgust:** A measuring tool\n* **Confusion:** A tormenter, but also forces me to figure things out\n* **Fear:** *\\*shaking\\** We do not speak of her...\n* **Anger:** Once allowed to roam free, then aggressively demonized, she is now my friend and prophesized savior (but is not allowed in the \"driver's seat\")\n* **Emptiness:** Once invisible to me, she is the fog my other emotions live inside\n\nI've had both an INFJ & INFP therapist. The INFJ 9 sx was too head-in-the-clothes and esoteric for me. The INFP 9 sp was an art therapist and wanted to make space for \"weirdos\", but she kept trying to curb my pursuit of further explanations, over and over again (but I got diagnosed with what she thought I didn't have, so, *ha!).*\n\nMy current therapist is an xNFx 6 and we get along *much* better. She immediately responds to what I bring up with connections and theories, for which I respond in kind, and we bounce off each other the whole appointment, every appointment. I come up with plans that do not come to fruitation because I end up just talking about whatever I feel like when I show up. She has a deck of archetypes and does tarot and I enjoy doing those with her sometimes. I had a close INTJ friend once; she and I could talk forever and ever, about psychology, personality, or whatever else. We both had had an edgy Nietzsche-ish teenage phase. Unfortunately, her Ni decided everyone who wasn't a blood relative was untrustworthy and terrible lmfao.\n\nLastly, my comfort artists are Florence Welch & Otep.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16px4fb)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.34979358}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.0157464}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.048303}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -4.6106253}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.8300886}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.2206907}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.483781}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.8086824}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -6.81581}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -7.026023}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.389346}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -7.6794615}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.247743}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -8.277497}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -8.294803}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.31372}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -8.380424}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -8.400289}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -8.478587}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -8.499734}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0008509631}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.6451917}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.348053}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.564899}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.566267}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -10.995947}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -12.0360985}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.350485}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.159176}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.35145}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.835131}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.936455}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.246637}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -14.259283}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -14.457821}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -14.527327}, {"token": "fp", "logprob": -14.790113}, {"token": "SP", "logprob": -15.172573}, {"token": "CP", "logprob": -15.183494}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -15.441112}]}}
{"submission": "English is my second language so I'm sorry if there are any spelling or grammatical mistakes. Also feel free to ask me anything if you think my answers weren't very helpful, I'll do my best to reply. \n\n**\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm 22, female. For starters I hate this type of questions, I don't really know what to say. I'm reserved, enjoy being alone, like learning new stuff but tend to get bored pretty fast, I'm a very anxious person and lazy which leads to a lot of procrastination.\n\n**\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNone.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nNo job, however, I'm studying to be an accountant, which was a hard choice to make since I'm interested in a lot of different fields.\n\n**\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nAs someone who enjoys being alone it would be an amazing weekend, definitely refreshing, especially if prior I had to be around a lot of people and socialize.\n\n**\u2022 \tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good  at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nIm lazy (sadly) so anything that requires physical activity is a pass for me. Also no activities in public spaces for me, there's people, it can be loud. I prefer to do stuff indoors alone or with people I'm comfortable with, like playing games, maybe some crafts.\n\n**\u2022 \tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What  are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nVery curious, I take interest in a lot of different subjects and just enjoy learning new things.\n\n**\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nAbsolutely not! I hate being in charge, however, in a group project, for example, if no one takes the lead I'll end up doing it myself since otherwise people don't seem to do anything, plus it helps better coordinate the group. Personally can't tell whether I'm good at it or not but I've been told that I am.\n\n**\u2022 \tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you  enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI honestly don't know, I do play videos games which require hand-eye coordination. I enjoy doing stuff with make hands and I'd say I'm fairly good at it, I had a period not that long ago where I was obsessed with origami and they did turn out pretty good.\n\n**\u2022 \tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular  artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of  art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nUnfortunatly no but i do enjoy music, dance, paintings, drawings and photography.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI try my best to focus on the present. While the past is important for we learn from our experiences, I try not to duel on it much, but still do from time to time (when it decides to come and haunt me out of nowhere). It's pretty much the same when it come to the future, it's uncertain therefore I don't really spend my time thinking about it.\n\n**\u2022 \tHow do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIf I'm busy I'm obviously going to prioritize myself, if I'm not though it depends. If the person is just trying to get me to do it for them absolutely not, if I notice the person actually needs help and I like them as a person I'll help but if I don't like them or I'm just indifferent I won't unless it benefits me in a way.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI'm not sure I understand exactly what this means but from what I've gathered logical consistency means there is no contradiction. If that is the case then, to some extent, yes, it's good to be consistent but I do believe we can benefit from contradictions. Just because there is consistency doesn't mean you're 'right'.\n\n**\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI do consider productivity to be important, and I feel kind of guilty everytime I realize I could've been more productive with my time, on the other hand, while it may be nice to be efficient I don't think it's as important.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nAs far as I'm aware no.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nPlaying video games, watching anime and reading manga and books. Honestly I just like it, I don't have a reason for it and I don't need one.\n\n**\u2022 \tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you  struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?**\n\nNot sure if there's a name for it but I need to put what I'm learning into practice and in a quite environment since otherwise I can't focus. I don't think I have a preference for how classes are taught but definitely no creativity or memorization for me, I'm not creative and have a bad memory.\n\n**\u2022\tHow good  are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable  tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you  go?**\n\nI'd say I'm somewhat good at strategizing. The thing is, I like to plan stuff out but I either end up changing my mind multiple times, like I'll come up with new ideas or a different way to do something, and some other times I'm just to lazy. \n\n**\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nProfessionally, I just want to succeed in something I can enjoy and that, hopefully, allows me to lead a financially comfortable life. Personally, wanna travel the world and just be a knowledgeable person.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nOne of my biggest fears is not succeding in life and never fully understanding myself. Something I hate is dishonesty.\n\n**\u2022 \tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of  your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI do daydream a lot, a bit unhealthy at times, but I'd say I'm still very attached to reality. While I use it as way to avoid dealing with real life problem I'm still aware I'll have to face them and most of the time can't actually focus on my daydreams because I'm stressed or anxious because of said problems. Also sometimes I use it to help me navigate real life by having conversations with the different characters in my head to either help me better understand a situation or how said situations could've affected me.\n\n**\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nFirst I'll think about how nice it is to be alone and then how boring it is. My thoughts can only keep me entertained for so long.\n\n**\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI hate making decision because it gives anxiety so I'll take as much time as I can and I'll change my mind multiple times before reaching a final decision. \n\n**\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nTo be honest I'm not sure, I don't really like to deal with emotions and definitely do my best to pretend they're not there when I'm aware of them. I see emotions as weakness.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nSometimes I'll agree with people simply because I don't have the mental capacity to deal with what could unfold were I to disagree. Plus I don't like conflict so I'll do my best to avoid it.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't usually break rules unless i find them unreasonable.   \n", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.82491416}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.234546}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.1206696}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.325681}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -3.2623665}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -5.400676}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -5.4101343}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.128928}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -6.645278}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -7.1376905}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.067801}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.613385}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -9.328116}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.374078}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -9.534923}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -9.664817}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.688811}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -9.762303}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -9.76628}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -9.809194}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.029883087}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -3.526036}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -11.915429}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.041915}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -13.595956}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -13.744769}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.85006}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -14.276982}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -14.56717}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -14.906583}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -15.1414995}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -15.782426}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -15.86847}, {"token": "PJ", "logprob": -15.953185}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -16.021204}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -16.208199}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -16.216846}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -16.244833}, {"token": "ERRUPT", "logprob": -16.363682}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -16.475039}]}}

I understood he was shy because of me. \nalso, he didn\u2019t show me his face for 2 months after this encounter\ud83d\ude2d but after that, I decided to go to his department and show him that \u201chey, I\u2019m still interested\u201d\n\n7- I catch him staring at me sometimes. \n8- when he notices me in a room his head does a sorta dramatic turn to where I am. \n9- his eyes are bigger and brighter and filled with clarity whenever he sees me and we make eye contact. \n10- he speaks with a lot of hand gestures. \n11- his eyes doesn\u2019t go around the room too much especially when he\u2019s talking to someone he just focuses on that person. \n12- NEVER seen or heard him laugh!! \n13- A nerd. \n14- he doesn\u2019t mind leading and he does a perfect job at it but when he follows he will be the best right-hand man. \n15- huge on details. \n16- perfectionist?? i think. \n17- comes to my department for no clear reason just for 2 minutes then leaves.

Shes in a top sorority at her school so \u2018acting\u2019 extroverted isn\u2019t an issue for her. Shes pretty laid back too but again, she\u2019s able to be serious and focused when the situation calls for it. She\u2019s a good problem solver and is good at staying calm in stressful situations. She procrastinates a bit and tends to leave things to the last minute, but she will always end up finishing the task. she cuts corners and finds her own way of doing things to speed up the process but hey, if it works it works.\n\nEmotions: She\u2019s not very emotional, she\u2019s pretty awkward during emotional conversations and i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever seen her cry. shes not great at consoling people but she\u2019s great at helping you take your mind off things and cheer up. She has pretty thick skin too, but when something *does* upset her, she\u2019ll vent about the problem itself but avoids talking about how she\u2019s feeling at all costs.\n\nConfrontation: she\u2019s pretty mellow and never causes conflict, but she\u2019s not afraid of it either. if someone crosses her, she\u2019ll confront them civilly but she also won\u2019t beat around the bush or sugarcoat things.\n\nHumor: her sense of humor is a bit odd (but luckily mine is too lmao). She\u2019s sarcastic, we both make fun of each other (lovingly, ofc). she\u2019s really into dark humor too, nothing too crazy but we\u2019d def get cancelled if anyone heard our conversations \ud83d\udc80\n\nFriendships: I\u2019m an ISFP and we\u2019ve been friends for years. our personalities are pretty compatible, ofc we have our differences but we rarely ever clash. she\u2019s the type of person you can sit in silence with without it being awkward. She values her alone time and it\u2019s common to not hear from her for a bit, but it\u2019s nothing personal. she\u2019s very independent and gets doesn\u2019t like clingy/overly dependent friends. however, she really values loyalty in her friendships.\n\nRelationships: She has major commitment issues and she\u2019s never had a long-term relationship. She told me it has less to do with trust, and more to do with a fear of being pinned down. she said that relationships scare her because she wouldn\u2019t have the freedom to leave without hurting the other person in the process. \n\nHobbies: She\u2019s really into anime and genshin impact (but she doesn\u2019t tell people that lmao), she also loves South Park, Bojack Horseman, and she\u2019s obsessed with Bobs Burgers (she literally dragged me to the movie). She\u2019s not super into music but she LOVES eminem for some reason \ud83d\udc80\u2026she\u2019s an odd ball but that\u2019s why i love her.

{"submission": "Hello! If anyone could try to type meI would be very grateful :) i actually made a few cognitive fonction tests but I am clearly becoming too used to it and can see through the questions and predict my answers haha. So I might be biased. Anyway, here as some things about me:\n\n-I rarely do things for no reason. I really like doing art craft, but if there is no reason at the end of it, I probably won\u2019t have the motivation. For example, I like making little machines of cardboard. It\u2019s really fun to make, but if it\u2019s not something I will use or that my brothers requested from me, I won\u2019t see the point haha. I don\u2019t have much energy.\n\n-I like having debates on things that I have a strong opinion of and yes, I kinda want others to see that my point of view is \u00ab\u00a0the good one\u00a0\u00bb, even if i completely understand that it is stupid most of the time. However, if I see that what we are talking about is something the person really cares about (like a religion for instance), I will want them to feel good believing in it so I won\u2019t dare say anything of course. I actually never dare to say mean things bluntly even if they are the truth in my head.\n\n-I actually want others to feel happy in their life. I will try to be agreeable so that they feel good. I don\u2019t think I am the same person all the time. At school, I\u2019m kinder and more shy then at home. However, it\u2019s not a character I am playing, but more an other version of me that others will possibly like more. The eyes of the group never leave my mind, and I am extremely self-conscious all the time to look good. It can be pretty exhausting.\n\n-I often think \u00ab\u00a0if I don\u2019t like doing it, why waste energy on it? Life is short\u00a0\u00bb, and it\u2019s mostly at school when we are in french class haha (english is my second language, so french class is pretty much every day). I don\u2019t care as long as I pass, and it\u2019s not always because I\u2019m lazy, I just don\u2019t see the point of forcing myself on grammar that I have no pleasure of doing. People don\u2019t always realise that we are on a floating ball in the middle of the universe and that we don\u2019t actually matter on an external point of view so why take these things too seriously \ud83d\ude05 just do what you like doing\nA meaningful life is not all about accomplishments and career but mostly about finding happiness and loving\n\n\n-These are quotes I need to remind myself everyday \u00ab\u00a0yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0you can\u2019t suffer from the past nor the future. You only suffer from your memory and imagination.\u00a0\u00bb Actually, I am always trying to prepare myself for a future \u00ab\u00a0problem\u00a0\u00bb like a project or an event that stresses me before it happens. At the end, I use my imagination and see myself in the worst situation that could happen there and try to find solutions for it already. It\u2019s not good and I forget to live in the right now sometimes. However, it wasn\u2019t always like that. I used to be pretty chill about almost everything, but I was young so I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n-I try to take the personalities of characters i love  in movies that I watch, and all the time I see that the person I want to be is a zen person that float like water on life, just accepting it as it comes and not being worried of future events, inner peace and happiness and everything haha. I always try to be better for me and others.\nIt\u2019s weird because if I really like a show but someone (i don\u2019t even have to know them) say it\u2019s shit, then I won\u2019t like it as I used to. Same for the opposite.\n\n-I want others to feel good but still, I think we should all focus on our life (and humanity as a whole, like caring about the Earth) so I do things I like even if people think it\u2019s weird.\nI often find myself bad and and unworthy of the ones I love though.\n\n-I have patterns for things. Like winter and Christmas, it\u2019s certain musics and emotions I feel and then emotions change for the next season, and I know the vibe I am gonna feel. it does that for so many things like stories and songs.\n\n\n\nAnyways so I don\u2019t know what to write anymore sorry if it was boring!

{"submission": "I've gotten infp a lot as test results when I was younger- but I don't think I really understood myself then and I had stuck to 16personalities for results too. Having explored myself a bit more- I think I'm coming to accept that I am perhaps different to the presumptions I made when I was younger.\n\nI used to envision myself as this polite person that would always be emotionally available to others and enjoyed creative endeavors and platforms that enabled freedom of expression.\n\nAnd then as time went on, I got tired. Yeah I still value being polite and respectful towards others and would like to be there for those I care about, but I just don't have the energy for that nor do I feel I even understand my emotions very well. One might ask me how my day has been, and I will generally answer with \"here are things that happened\" and if you're lucky \"here is how I think I feel about it\". \n\nI have realized I don't understand others as well as I thought I did either (I am a late diagnosed autistic + adhd as per several mental health professionals) and it had shaken me to my core with who I thought I was. I thought I could never be the person I saw as myself yesterday- though in reality I am a person who has only grown and had their views change. I have come to accept that it's not really important that I be who I thought I was but just whoever I happen to be now.\n\nAnd now, after getting to see myself in my interactions with others and getting to explore my existence beyond hiding away from the world and struggling with mental health- I have been getting intp (and istp too) far more than infp on different tests. I have been noticing that I do tend to process things in a lens that seeks to understand- if I am playing a game I try to figure out what I'm supposed to do and what is the best way to do it before I do it. If I'm not confident on something, I will not give you an answer because it's important to me that I'm not misleading you. If I need to do a menial task that I view as pointless- I need to think more on why I need to do it and how it would benefit me in other areas to convince myself to do it. \n\nSo.

{"submission": "It looks like a lot but it's a fast read cuz the point are short. Keep in mind that I also have inattentive ADHD and this might affect some of the points here. \n\n\n- I don't like tradition. I very rarely take the tried and true path. I much more prefer finding my own way of doing sth \n\n- I'm a big picture person, don't like dealing with details - I hate the mundane part of life, it's just so boring to me! I love being immersed in my interests to escape the mundane tasks \n\n- I love seeing patterns in eg. people's behaviors (I study psychology)\n\n- I love the feeling of the dots connecting \n\n- Once I get into a topic, I read about it for months until I read everything that is available on the internet. I have very specific interests (that mostly consern finding myself and why I am the way I am) and am not interested in the 'overall knowledge' \n\n- I'm a black and white thinker \n\n- I have a huge fear of failure or making mistakes, which prevents me from starting new projects. I need to be 100% sure I am competent enough to freely start a new task. That's the main reason why I procrastinate \n\n- I overcomplicate my life by overthinking things and taking a route that is super complicated when there is a much easier way to do things \n\n- I love knowing things for sure. I hate it when I can't get closure on a topic that is bothering me \n\n- Because I like closure so much I am a decisive person. I just like narrowing my options down because this way, it's easier to decide. I get totally lost if I have too many options. \n\n- I am very good at remembering symbols and their meanings (like foreign alphabets, eg.) \n\n- I have very good spatial memory - I have a map of some places in my head \n\n- Peace is very important to me. I hate getting in conflicts, and I am very good at solving conflicts between other people because I can understand both sides \n\n- I am very good at understanding other people's perspectives. I like to put myself in their shoes and see how I would feel in their situation, but at the same time, I can understand a perspective that I totally can't relate to, and I respect it \n\n- I have a lot of respect for the fact that people can have a different way of thinking than me, and I rarely try to convince them I'm right. In fact, I'm very interested in their viewpoint and like to see how you can see the same thing from 2 different perspectives \n\n- I love categorizing things and putting things into folders (both mental and real). I have a ton of boards on Pinterest for literally everything. I also have a playlist for every weather, season, and mood on Spotify. I just love classifying things. \n\n- My favorite topic to talk about is people. I love analyzing them, their behaviors, their ways of thinking, etc. \n\n- I don't care where an idea came from as long as I think it's a good one \n\n- Meaning is more important to me than pure facts, and I want to understand what's going on behind the scenes \n\n- Authenticity and sincerity are important to me, and I hate when others seem fake or insincere. I only talk about myself or share my deepest feelings with my closest friends and family. \n\n- When I just got to know a person, I like to ask them a lot of questions to get to know them. This way, they are talking about themselves, and I don't have to share things about myself \n\n- I feel responsible for other people's feelings, and I adjust my behavior to make them feel comfortable to the point that I sacrifice my comfort \n\n- I love connecting with people on a deep level that's why I prefer one on one conversations \n\n- I like the feeling of belonging to a community and finding common ground with people \n\n- I'm in tune with other people's emotions, and I try to fulfill their needs \n\n- I prefer helping people close to me rather than fighting for a whole community \n\n- I don't like change, and I am very cautious when starting something new. I'm definitely not a risk taker \n\n- I'm a pretty nostalgic person. I like going back to the pleasant memories \n\n- I'm not the type of person who loves wearing a favorite sweater or eating a favorite meal often. I like trying out new things more \n\n- I'm not in tune with my internal bodily sensations like pain, hunger, and thirst. \n\n- When I take in new information, I compare it to my past experiences \n\n- I can do mindless repetitive tasks. They relax me because I can think about other things then, and I don't have to focus too much \n\n- I can come up with ways of solving a problem others wouldn't even think about.

{"submission": "Hello guys, I've been pretty lost about my type and I wanted to ask you guys if y'all could maybe help me discovering my type? \nI know y'all don't know me personally enough to even slightly know my correct type but maybe you guys could tell me some differences and your thoughts on my description of myself? \n\n\nWell anyways, let's start of with Fi and Fe. The most difficult for me to decide.\nI'm someone that values my personal beliefs and I want to discover and know myself in every way possible. I wanna be sure of myself and keep my values but don't wanna violate social harmony in any way. I think that if I have to make a specific decision where others are involved, it's my duty as a human being to compromise. I wouldn't just sacrifice my values for other people but would like to work together that would include both of our values and not just our own. Kind of like combining them? Maybe sacrificing a little bit but our core values should stay. I would never want to violate others values and I normally sacrifice my own but if it's about my simple human empathy, it will stay and I will remain faithful to the values that are the most \"wholesome\" in a harmonic way for both, me and the others.\n\nNow let's continue with Te and Ti. I don't know at all what I am from both of those. Sometimes I think Te and sometimes Ti.\nIf I have to describe it then I would say that I mostly build up a system that goes along both ways. I focus on the details that I gathered and put them in a whole. I do believe in the others and I'm willing to listen. I mostly make my own conclusion out of things but also listen to the others. It's more like a pattern where I gather information from myself and others and all those informations are one big picture that I form together at the end to come to a conclusion.\n\n\nLet's continue with Ni and Ne because of the way that I described how I come to a \"decision\" is the same here.\nI gather information and then put them together and from one big picture.\nI relate to Ni a lot because I often come to conclusions that come out of nowhere and that I can't really explain either. I like to guess the outcome and I'm often right. I'm someone that likes to go in depth with specific things for the sake of going in depth with that specific thing. But sometimes I feel like Ne. I can be very creative with my outcomes and like to include multiple factors to make my ideas work. I can be a brainstormer too.\n\nSo let's move on to Se and Si.\nI think I'm Si. I'm not good for quick reactions. I'm often in thought and relate a LOT to including past experiences to the present one and rather focus on \"my inner body\" If that makes sense. I easly miss things in the outside world and I'm not that good with bodily sensations either. I think my Si/Se would rather be a third or even fourth functions than my second or first.\n\nI think I'm someone that probably has a Feeling/Intuitive function first. And then probably a thinking and sensing function.\n\nIt's confusing but my decisions/feelings/ideas kinda feel like that if I include (every) function:\n1. FX or Ni\n2. Ne or FX\n3.TX/i or Si\n4. Se/Te\n\nI often typed myself as INFP but then at the other hand (what doesn't make sense because they don't even have the same functions) INFJ.\nI considered ENFP but that doesn't really make sense for me", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.13849035}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.6678922}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.930147}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.842281}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.3669486}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.83991}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.326355}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.356438}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.594725}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -8.884409}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -8.998209}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.731724}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.92938}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.002762}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -10.045803}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.270775}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -10.283867}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -10.305464}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -10.315643}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.491997}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0019112655}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.9384384}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -7.222309}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.881464}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.839628}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.3815155}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.011049}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -13.0717945}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -13.152212}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -13.3666725}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.726137}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.935789}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -15.0553055}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -15.094576}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -15.229717}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -15.345457}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -15.348793}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -15.670858}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -15.730108}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -15.777849}]}}

{"submission": "\n- (They are female) They are very imaginative. They can view the world through the lens of cartoon style animations, cinematic shots, nostalgic song tracks, anime. They say they even unconsciously form cinematic posters and dramatic track sounds using any art style in their brain where people in their lives are the main characters.\n\nBut they are always in the corner, never being the highlight of it. Only the background character as if to show they are the observer and observing rather than being the part of the show.\n\n- They also imagine people in their life through all those ways. They also have this thing where they imagine everybody in their life as villains. Even me. Excluding their family.\n\n- It's kind of similar to how in WandaVision, Wanda is constantly imagining many intros. They definitely do the same. But they say they don't make any of the imagination positive. It's mostly negative or neutral. They kind of imagine parental abuse, neglect, drama despite never going through those things. Though they did experience emotional invalidation in their childhood.\n\nBut what I am mainly confused about is their high Fi and Ti:\n\n- When I see them solve a logical problem, I notice they need a lot of time to think about it. They want to read into every aspect of it.\n\nTheir thinking process is like: What is it? What is included and what isn't? What type of information can I use to do this problem? Why do we have to do those specific methods when there are easier ones? Let me search internet on this question/topic (they are really good at finding niche resources by making their search more specific). And then they get confused because they don't know if they are doing the correct or incorrect thing. And then that makes then procrastinate because they don't feel they know the subject enough or are not interested enough. \n\n- I also notice they check consistency of speeches of teachers. If a teacher says they will help students succeed but also say they think students should fail, they claim the teacher is not reliable or trustworthy because they said two contradictory beliefs or statements.\n\n-They do feel a lot. They can see the world in a bit romanticised way. \n-They are bad at knowing what to do with their emotions. They see it as something lurking under themselves and they don't know what to do other than see if it's okay to feel them or not and if not, they try to twist it into something else otherwise they let themselves cry in private. \n\nThey say they don't open up because they don't think the reasons for why they feel those particular feelings are justified enough to make them feel that way so they just try to manage them bit by bit so they can control it.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16x6mnu)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.17339376}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.3133073}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.8563008}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.753697}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -7.15268}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.8241925}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.41192}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -10.257661}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -10.3748255}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.570773}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.811355}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -10.869269}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.925618}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -11.095977}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -11.153663}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -11.435796}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -11.754384}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.763707}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -11.809052}, {"token": " **", "logprob": -11.933806}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0011767743}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.875492}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.111584}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -10.272444}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.346447}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -11.678165}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.722599}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.061184}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.711559}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.799948}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -14.014931}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.031277}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.138622}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -14.324932}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -14.676199}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -14.69343}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -14.728014}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -15.111319}, {"token": "_", "logprob": -15.191425}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -15.248144}]}}
{"submission": "* ***How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.***\n\nI am 21 years old, and a male. I can\u2019t really give a description of myself, because I don\u2019t truly understand who I am \u2013 I often put on a persona to conform to society. I focus on being liked by others so I suppress my personality. I don't have any friends because I don't open up to others for them to know who I am, instead, I am a mute blank canvas. \n\nAlthough, I would say I am socially anxious, reserved, and can be avoidant. However, at the same time, I get envious of those in the \u2018spotlight,\u2019 wishing I was in their place. My external persona is different from my internal or comfortable self. I seem irritated, logical, observant, and quiet. Though, I can be goofy, witty, helpful, and emotional. I prefer living inside my head rather than focusing on the external world.\n\n* ***Is there a medical diagnosis that impacts your mental/compartmental stability somehow?***\n\nI\u2019ve been diagnosed with social anxiety and OCD.\n\n* ***Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?***\n\nThere was some structure growing up. My family is Catholic which I still am, but I haven't attended church in years. My parents strived to instill the importance of common sense, efficiency, and education in my sisters and me. Which created a structured environment that didn't allow me to be myself completely. In structured settings such as school, I was a teacher's pet: quiet, rule follower, et cetera.\n\nAs a kid, I would whisk my friends on imaginary adventures creating new worlds. I was always outside, running around or climbing trees, rarely indoors. I preferred things to go my way. I tended to drift in and out of my circle of friends. Sometimes I would spend time with them, while other times I would disappear for a few weeks to pursue my own interests. However, I always returned as if nothing had changed. This is because I tend to forget about people and things if they are not present in my immediate surroundings.\n\nAlthough I love my family, I have some issues from my childhood. This has caused me to be very defensive and sarcastic, instigating and criticizing others before they can do the same to me. Also, I have this tension between conforming to my parent's and society's expectations and exploring my own identity.\n\n* ***What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?***\n\nCurrently, I am a senior in college majoring in political science, I thought about becoming an attorney; because I am a rule follower, and I like the logical/common sense thinking required. However, I hope to get my master's in history, and then a PhD in classics. My long-term goal is to become a classics professor. I like the idea of spending my time researching my interests with the independence/freedom, and creativity being a professor provides; and that I can dress more casually and not wear suits, which shouldn't be a factor, but is. Although, I enjoy school and am planning on doing it for seven more years; I do get burned out quickly if I am not interested in the material.\n\n* ***If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?***\n\nRefreshed; I am an introvert and enjoy having alone time to decompress. Although I hate being completely alone, I need to know others are around where I can see or hear them but don't have to socialize. Whenever I am alone, I tend to spiral into the chaos of my mind and become depressed and anxious. So, I enjoy being active, but alone.\n\n* **What is your relationship with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or an outdoor event? If an outdoor event, what is it? And why? If you tend to engage in something other than what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nI like being active and outdoors, but I am not particularly coordinated. Nor do I like to watch or play sports. But I do enjoy going for walks, yoga, and dancing \u2013 whenever I have the courage. I walk often as it allows me to think and reflect. I spend quite a bit of time sitting outside at parks or cafes drinking tea and people-watching.\n\n* ***How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?***\n\nVery. Well, I am curious about the topics I am interested in and spend hours going through Wikipedia. I wouldn't say I have more ideas than I can execute. I rarely have ideas, and when I do, I usually toss them to the side because they are unoriginal. In relation to the previous question, I do most of my thinking, reflecting, and introspecting when I am driving or walking out in nature. I can't sit at a desk and think, I need to be doing something \u2013 even taking a shower gets me thinking, but sitting at a desk\u2026nope.\n\n* ***Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art. If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise express what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.***\n\nI am artistic, but in no circumstances am I an \u2018artist.\u2019 I \u2018enjoy\u2019 writing and aspire to be an author and a poet, but I couldn't tell you the last time I wrote. I like music and am always playing it in the background. I usually listen to the same songs on repeat until I find others that catch my interest. I play the piano \u2013 not that I am any good. I enjoy attending art museums, mostly to look at sculptures from antiquity. It would be exciting to collect art one day and have my own collection.\n\n* ***What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?***\n\nTime is an interesting subject. The past and future are where I focus the most, I need to actively pay attention to the present. I am a nostalgic person. I am often reminiscing about the past \u2013 \u2018the good old days;\u2019 and how time has passed too fast. Though, most of my memories are pessimistic, how I missed out on the \u2018teenage experience.\u2019 I am always thinking and imagining the future, but I am never in the present enjoying it. Though I enjoy imagining the future, I am very delusional and unrealistic. Though, I do have this unhealthy obsession with \u2018societies\u2019 time-table; I feel if I don't have a career or house or get married at a certain age then I miss my only opportunity. \n\n* ***Do you need logical consistency in your life?***\n\nYes and no. I like having a schedule and am a creature of habit. However, I make schedules only to not follow through with them. Though my routines are something I have always followed. I also enjoy being logical, and became more so during my teenage years. I often question others and their facts. But in arguments, I don't use any facts, I am more controlled by my opinions and emotions \u2013 I throw spaghetti at the wall and hope others believe me.\n\n* ***How important are efficiency and productivity to you?***\n\nVery. I am very impatient and get irritated with others who are slow and incompetent. I am always looking at ways to make things more efficient, but I couldn't be the one to implement it. Although I am a procrastinator; I always wait until the very last minute to do anything.\n\n* ***Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?***\n\nI am an instigator, I say different things to get a reaction from others and sometimes to have them do something for me. My family has nicknamed me Gator because I do it often \u2013 I don't know why it's like second nature at this point. I like to learn information about others, not to gossip or manipulate them - I just like to have information - but that doesn't mean I haven\u2019t gossiped.\n\n* ***What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?***\n\nI like walking, playing video games, reading, watching TV, spending time with loved ones, and going down Wikipedia rabbit holes. I enjoy walking as mentioned before, because it allows me to be alone with my thoughts to introspect and think. I play games like Skyrim and World of Warcraft because I am interested in lore \u2013 rarely playing. I like reading and watching TV for the same reasons \u2013 escapism. I always think of myself as a character in different books or shows and create scenarios. I also spend time with my loved ones playing card games.\n\n* ***What are your aspirations?***\n\nProfessionally, I am hoping to get my MA and then a PhD to become a professor. I would love to spend my days researching my interests, teaching others, and having an impact, not only on their education, but lives. I have had a few impactful professors who have benefited my education, but also went above their job descriptions, and would love to be that person for others.\n\nPersonally, I am a hopeless romantic, so I hope to get into a relationship. Spend more time on my hobbies, so maybe I could become a published author one day. Overall, I aspire to live life to the fullest, as I have not and am not doing so.\n\n* ***What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?***\n\nMy biggest fears are losing my loved ones and time. It's hard to imagine my life without my family, and time seems to be slipping away too quickly. I often wish I could experience more of what life has to offer. I dream of living a thousand lives, and the number of times I've changed my goals, I could. Another fear of mine is failure. My parents have always pushed me to do my best, and I don't want to disappoint them or myself. I feel uncomfortable in physical or intimate situations, and dread hearing the words 'We need to talk.' I'm not good at opening up to others, but I crave intimacy with a partner.\n\n* ***What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?***\n\nStepping out of my comfort zone - enjoying life to the fullest. Whether that means dancing to my favorite song even if I am the only one. Taking long drives down backroads with the radio on and windows down. Laughing with my loved ones. Having hobbies. Taking care of myself physically and mentally. Doing my best, instead of procrastinating and doing mediocre work.\n\n* ***What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?***\n\nWhen I am stressed, I can get impatient with others. I feel like I have to do everything. I become reclusive and pessimistic. Hide who I am to keep the peace \u2013 always playing the diplomat. Doing the same thing over and over, not getting out of my comfort zone. Minuscule physical ailments drive me to think I am dying. \\*This has been me for the majority of the past seven years\\*\n\n* ***How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?***\n\nIt takes me a while to make decisions, as I usually make decisions with a mix of logic and emotions. I usually make a pro/con list, but then I end up going with what I feel is the best or what I am feeling at the moment. After, every time I make a decision I always look back and see what would have happened if I had chosen differently even if the decision I made was the best.\n\n* ***How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?***\n\nIt takes me a while to process my emotions, as I am not the best at knowing what I am feeling and why. My emotions also change often and drastically throughout the day. I feel emotions with intensity. Though, I repress and never express what I am feeling. When others want to talk about my emotions, I get passive-aggressive and sarcastic. I try to keep the harmony between people, so I don't let my emotions get caught up in the midst.\n\n* ***Do you break rules often?

Not just the bland learning videos that just explained short events, but things that go in depth, like battlefields, tactics, Jared Owen Vids, and in-depth vids of every structure like Math, Science, etc.\n- Learning about things is not a quick process, it takes time to fully understand for me, go more in depth with the topic itself so that I can have full mastery of it itself. I stutter when I don't have the time to fully go in depth with things at school. Like I need to understand everything, the whole concept just for it to make sense.

I never realized I was clingy, but I tend to sometimes cling to people in relationships, especially with my cousin.

Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? - I've been raised in a devout (yet liberal) Catholic household with my grandmother and aunt (w/ GF); they're generally loving, but also a bit strict.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? - I generally enjoy most of my subjects out of genuine interest (except PE because I'm not athletic), but I also tend to suffer from a combination of heavy workload and procrastination. I also enjoy the social aspect of school for the most part (to the point that I tend to search for connections within the social realm), but I tend to have issues socializing sometimes (more on social anxiety than shyness).\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? - I could survive two days alone at home, but I'd rather go out and explore the city than stay cooped up in my room (currently forced to though) since staying in one place can get boring.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities? - Playing mobile games, browsing the internet, writing (preferrably non-fiction or poetry), currently trying to get into programming\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? - I'm definitely the type of person to be curious about a lot of things (but mostly my surroundings, others' hidden motives and backstories, invisible factors in the \"system\"). I also tend to come up with a bunch of ideas (usually involving moneymaking schemes, fantasy worlds, future plans in general, and the like).\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? - I've always wanted to become a leader, but I'm not really sure if I'm up to the task due to issues with executive function. If I were to take on the role though, I'd definitely be the type who would be kind, diplomatic, and ambitious while assigning tasks to others based on their strengths and trying to get things done as quickly as possible in order to be better than potential competition (can be a competition freak at times, though it's pretty subdued). I'd also try my best to be organized while planning projects, but executive function issues can and will get in the way.\n\n(continued in comments)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.9765167}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -1.2642097}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -1.5730305}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -3.173359}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -3.2958374}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -3.4744873}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.481573}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -5.5520134}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.6169434}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -5.9162045}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -6.394352}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -6.6942997}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.767435}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.896061}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.6446877}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -7.6719112}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -7.7419033}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.89485}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -7.930458}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -8.905439}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0020757904}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.2953286}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.081185}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.590852}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.977616}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -11.868966}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.405871}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -12.486571}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.239909}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -13.40948}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.661489}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.685668}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.996236}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -14.235797}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.280513}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -14.539794}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -14.597718}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -14.769301}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -15.109021}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -15.276963}]}}
{"submission": "#  I'm going to try be as open and vulnerable as possible, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much :)\n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. \n\nI'm a 16 year old male. I've got a very melancholic temperament most of the time, but it's quite internal, I've been told I can be bossy and uncaring outwardly sometimes when I care about something, but when I don't I tend to be very laid back. I like writing... I mostly like writing in my head though haha, I rarely ever get anything out, my execution ability is... I don't want to say it's bad? Because I've never really tried, but, I have such a perfect layout of a plot for like an entire book in my head but it's so vague, when I actually attempt to lay it out I realise how little I have actually really thought it out - I mean this in the sense that I always only seem to have a \"general vibe\" and for some reason I always just see the end of the book, I know exactly how I want people to feel towards the ending.\n\n \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nGreat honestly! At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI think I'd like it... I usually get very tired just from the outside world... I always get home from college basically dead haha...\n\n \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious! I think? I love coming up with ideas, I think the way I view the world is probably the core of my entire identity. I have a very very strange way of seeing things I think... I came up with a concept recently that I found super interesting. I have a few in mind after saying that so I'm just gonna flip a coin to decide lmao. Okay, this one - so I was wondering initially (this is what led me to the final though) \"if someone gets put on a machine that makes them feel unfathomably good, and then get taken off of it and given the chance to stay off or go back on, do they have a choice or does their external environment just command them?\". This led me to come up with a better version: (imo) if someone came into my home, put a gun to my head and demanded I do an extremely simple task, or I die - and I have completely free will (atleast theoretically) to make whichever choice I wanted - do I actually have free will? If I value my life, logic commands me to complete the task - lets say its something extremely simple like there are no cons to completing it, like say, touching the wall in front of me - all logic commands me to complete that task. But in a way that isn't me making a decision is it? I'm being commanded by the circumstances of my external environment. So my idea was what if we made that pointless, unreasonable choice, just because? It's an absurd reasoning, sure, but a very human one imo.\n\n \n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot really, I mean, I can at times and I think I like doing things in my own way - honestly though I've never really been put to the test?

How and why do you do that?\n\nI think I do in a sense, yeah. I sometimes will say things just because I know that person will like me for it. I'm not a people pleaser in the slightest - in fact I actually can sometimes cause conflict just for the sake of it: like I remember often in highschool my friendgroup would come ask me to come out and even if I really wanted to, sometimes I'd just refuse... out of a sort of spite I think?

And I remember in highschool I would always get terrified of being seen daydreaming so I just wouldn't. I remember fearing looking like my mum. I love her! So much, don't get me wrong, but she would always do this thing where she would just stare off into the distance and not think...

{"submission": "hi, fairly new to typing myself. any help would be great.\n\nsome things about me goes as follows:\n\n\u2022 i can be a little arrogant with how i run my mouth sometimes. external validation i know is something i should avoid, which is hard when you don't have a proper sense of self.\n\n\u2022 i can be impatient due to stress or really just people who don't seem to get the point. this puts some strain on my relationships, but i've found i often get along with ppl who are chill with it. i also get along with low maintenance ppl. my best friends are them.\n\n\u2022 for organisation, i organise most of the time either physically or mentally. mentally is when i make routines or systems to make the next day a little easier. but, i do procrastinate often during \"overloaded\" days, feeling overwhelmed & numb.\n\n\u2022 i value art in any form. furniture, books, architecture, music - anything beautiful is worth being given a second glance at least, if i don't have the time or will in me to learn about it.\n\n\u2022 i spend most of my leisure time playing games, reading, or frankly just sleeping, which doesn't come a lot. i'm not sure if it's my time management, but i find i require more sleep than 8 hours to feel refreshed, hence i can't focus on my other hobbies and instead have to direct time towards studying.\n\n\u2022 my family's my priority, though some of them can say and do things i don't agree with. very rarely have i ever cut off a family member for breaking boundaries, but once i did, i've never let them in my life again.\n\n\u2022 i'm agnostic-atheist. religion to me is a form of control, & i hate being controlled by ppl who have no control over their usage of their logic. i don't know if there's a god. i don't believe in one.\n\n\u2022 i've been reluctant to get into the mbti community after seeing so many arguments against it. i'm trying it because i'm into self improvement, & i figured it can't hurt if i try yet still be able to acknowledge its weak points later. the same can't go for getting into religion. it can never be self improvement to me.\n\n\u2022 helping people is one of my greatest motivations to move through this life, though my expressions and words to others may not look the part. i'm not really unapproachable, but i also don't want everyone in my circle or probing into my personal matters. most around me just aren't contented with acquaintance, which is stupid and probably a fault of our culture here.\n\n\u2022 i love sceneries, nature, most to do with it.\n\n\u2022 i used to be spiritual, and though no matter how much i try to deny it, some of that stuff still sticks with me. it's irrational, yet sometimes i just automatically listen to my gut, soul, whatever you call it. i'm working not to dispel that but rather understand it better.\n\nthat's really all. thanks if you've read until here.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.0621299}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.2713298}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.4420432}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.3486252}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -3.480833}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.0709686}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.775999}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.0427685}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.4056015}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.5549946}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.6032906}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.37981}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -8.978704}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -8.987314}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.129435}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.169989}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -9.292633}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -9.317221}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -9.902267}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -10.6266575}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.00086024636}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.1340313}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.633606}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.922497}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -11.569397}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -12.431055}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.3874855}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -13.435049}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -14.22551}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -14.367104}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -15.11689}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -15.139557}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -15.418259}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -15.844051}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -15.977163}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -16.023848}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -16.054546}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -16.318066}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -16.582886}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -16.719557}]}}
{"submission": "\n#  I'm going to try be as open and vulnerable as possible, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much :)\n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. \n\nI'm a 16 year old male. I've got a very melancholic temperament most of the time, but it's quite internal, I've been told I can be bossy and uncaring outwardly sometimes when I care about something, but when I don't I tend to be very laid back. I like writing... I mostly like writing in my head though haha, I rarely ever get anything out, my execution ability is... I don't want to say it's bad? Because I've never really tried, but, I have such a perfect layout of a plot for like an entire book in my head but it's so vague, when I actually attempt to lay it out I realise how little I have actually really thought it out - I mean this in the sense that I always only seem to have a \"general vibe\" and for some reason I always just see the end of the book, I know exactly how I want people to feel towards the ending.\n\n \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nGreat honestly! At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI think I'd like it... I usually get very tired just from the outside world... I always get home from college basically dead haha...\n\n \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious! I think? I love coming up with ideas, I think the way I view the world is probably the core of my entire identity. I have a very very strange way of seeing things I think... I came up with a concept recently that I found super interesting. I have a few in mind after saying that so I'm just gonna flip a coin to decide lmao. Okay, this one - so I was wondering initially (this is what led me to the final though) \"if someone gets put on a machine that makes them feel unfathomably good, and then get taken off of it and given the chance to stay off or go back on, do they have a choice or does their external environment just command them?\". This led me to come up with a better version: (imo) if someone came into my home, put a gun to my head and demanded I do an extremely simple task, or I die - and I have completely free will (atleast theoretically) to make whichever choice I wanted - do I actually have free will? If I value my life, logic commands me to complete the task - lets say its something extremely simple like there are no cons to completing it, like say, touching the wall in front of me - all logic commands me to complete that task. But in a way that isn't me making a decision is it? I'm being commanded by the circumstances of my external environment. So my idea was what if we made that pointless, unreasonable choice, just because? It's an absurd reasoning, sure, but a very human one imo.\n\n \n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot really, I mean, I can at times and I think I like doing things in my own way - honestly though I've never really been put to the test? And when I do get put into positions of leadership I get incredibly bossy and critical, I hate it.\n\n \n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not?

{"submission": "Childhood (< 12) - Happy, hyperactive, extraverted, imaginative, good with adults, heavy reader, big vocabulary, sensitive, took well to theater and acting but not sports, enjoyed running around in the woods, not good with kids own age/bullied heavily, could become loud and annoying in class and other large group situations. Parented like perfect little gifted child.\n\nYoung teens (13-15) - Only child, fighting in the house, mother with unpredictable outbursts. Used \"creativity\" to make memes and mean jokes about others behind their backs in order to stop being bullied but nice in person, couldn't shut up or stop making jokes in class. Insecure, lonely, \"edgy\" phase. Hyperaware of how everyone else dressed, behaved, and the slang they used and spent way too much time copying in order to fit in. Stopped reading, stopped doing theater. \n\nMiddle teens (15-17) - Awareness of girls kicked into full gear which magnified loneliness and anxiety tenfold. Mom became overbearing and clingy, parents fought more. Firmly stuck in viscous cycle of intense loneliness and trying to stand out by insecurely \"being funny\" or \"deep\", which meant saying very strange things in class which made isolation worse. Simultaneously trying to fit in and stand out so you had a weird lanky kid in air jordans loudly saying some shit about the moon being alive and then nervous laughing. COVID also hit. Always been a messy, disorganized procrastinator, but schoolwork actually became impossible and worse than death. Went on night hikes and listened to music to try and make myself less alone. Just wanted love and connection, and thought being weird attention whore would get me there when it really just made my problem worse. When I felt alone, I would post something weird I thought would make people react and then sit waiting for notifications in a cold sweat. Hopeless romantic too, love language was 6+ hour long conversations about religion, politics, and other deep, human related topics. Whenever I talked to a girl I would imagine all these whimsical, dreamlike dates we would go on and then get a pit in my stomach and break down when she didn't respond. All the music I liked was about love, and all the movies I liked were whimsical and involved some sort of depressed person finding meaning. Still very curious. Wrote a lot of short stories about love, death, family, religion, and belonging. Went on google maps for fun, youtube rabbit holes about society and culture. started drawing. Very nostalgic too so into liminal spaces, exploring dead malls, etc... Got into typology, typed as ENFP (very unhealthy and immature, so probably not real type).\n\n(18-19) - Three antidepressants later. Still lonely, still looking for love and community, still loud and annoying, Life in shambles, smoking weed and drinking all the time. Trouble processing time (whatever is happening now will be happening forever), emotional desperation turned into sexual desperation, no standards, no backbone, people pleaser, easy to manipulate. Lost, out of control, trouble with authority and being told what to do, feel like a 14 year old. Still having trouble with organization and messiness. Trouble in relationships because cannot say no and no consistant hobbies, dreams, or motivation. Get bored of people and things easily. Envious not just of what people have, but of who they are as people. Impulsive and guilty about it. Frying my brain with carts so heavy disassociation. Creativity, intelligence, curiosity, and emotional depth formerly used to define self-esteem now disappearing so left with nothing. No enjoyment of learning, music, hiking, or anything else. Dropped out of college, worked at a car dealership, quit because I couldn't sleep at night scamming people, got very sick and depressed for months while my parents were doing nothing but fight. Weed and cigarettes. Narcissistic traits piling up like crazy. Worked as an amusement park mascot, quit because they were too controlling. \n\n(19 part 2) - Moved in with my grandparents and my personality is changing immensely. I like physical activity more, I find my emotional intelligence increasing, and my sad, insecure Fi is being oddly replaced by a more secure Fe. I like being around people, but I also like time for self-reflection. I enjoy problem-solving. I feel insanely guilty for being narcissistic, impulsive, and self-centered for all those years. My goals for the future used to be creative, but now are more humanitarian. Either bamboo cultivation, urban planning, or even firefighting if I can get my shit together. I am taking an Environmental Science and an Anthropology and I love both of them. Less inclined, almost averse to making things about me because I know how alone it made me feel and don't want to embarrass myself again, but Fe feels forced, like I am training myself to be the kind of person who will finally find lasting love and community through kindness and curiosity. Envy is going away, trying to become quieter and truly interested in others for who they are. Trying to turn people-pleasing instinct into actually being helpful. The only time I'm really talkative is asking questions in class. There used to be itch to immediately say what was on my mind, but I am getting it under control and listening is more fun now. Quit weed, had mood swings for the first couple of weeks, but they are evening out now. There are intense bouts of depression and self hatred for the person I used to be, and dread that I still am that person, but I am starting to become comfortable with being alone, single, and not having attention on me. I have never been able to discover myself before. When I feel something narcissistic, want to talk about myself, or be clingy, I am getting pretty good at shocking myself out of it. I still don't have hobbies, but certain dreams are beginning to form. Learning from, studying, and doing things for other people is fun because other people are generally pretty cool.

Sorry it's messy and some of the answers probably don't give much, and I hope I didn't mess anything up before clicking post.\n\nHere are my main considerations in case that helps in any way:\n\n   \u2022 ISFP - INFJ - INTJ - ENFP - INFP \u2022\n\n\u2022 (not answered: How old are you? What's your gender?) Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nFurry, Conlanger, interested in linguistics, I speak three languages to a conversational/fluent level and I'm working on the fourth. Psychology and philosophy have always been interesting to me. \n\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n\numm not medical, but I think I have anxiety. \n\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nWell, I grew up with a very strict father that made me do his sport of choice, kickboxing, because um... not really sure why. he's got anger issues and is very conservative. my mother is nice. more about my father, during my earlier years he'd use to punish me a lot for every small mistake, and he usually yells at me for those kinds of things to this day. I, of course, rebelled and rebel to this day. I know it's not going to get me anywhere, but I don't see a better option.\n\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nthe closest thing I do to work is assisting my father at teaching kids Kickboxing. I don't enjoy it a single bit tbh, but I'm kinda chained to the occupation. it's too much \"do this and do it right\" and not enough \"this is how you can grow and improve\". the careers I'm pursuing are linguistics and psychology, and I plan to work as a translator. \n\n\n\u2022 |f you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nVery much refreshed in most cases, but I would probably miss my close friends a bit. As long as I have YouTube and music though, I can spend any indefinite amount of time without proper human interaction.\n\n\n\u2022 What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nHmm... well, I'd probably rather stay at home, but I'm assuming that isn't an option here. I'd choose a simple sport: hiking. I don't do it much, but it's just the perfect refresher from human interaction I need some days. \n\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am very curious and eager to learn about any and everything. I like learning. When I'm brainstorming I usually throw out a couple ideas, and then choose one. that one. the perfect idea!!!!!!!!!! but really I do just forget about my other ideas when I choose one. my curiosities usually go over the unknown, over the symbols that aren't written, the words that aren't said. It's just interesting to me.\nmy ideas usually come out of seemingly nowhere, and they're usually conceptual, like: \"oh, I could use x idea for a conlang! that's so cool!\" and that's how most of my conlang ideas appear. I can't just have an idea unless I have something to base it on, or some meaning to give it, if that makes sense.\n\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nthis depends lots on context. generally speaking, I think I would enjoy being a leader, just gets things how I want them. I like to think I'd be a good and fair leader, but I seldom actually get the opportunity to lead any group, so idk. my leadership style is - I think - trying to individually coach everyone in the group to do the tasks they're best at, and to improve themselves and their skill set. if stuff is all going wrong though I do tend to take on a more assertive role and just tell people what to do because I *said so*.\n\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not exactly sure what this is asking, but I think I know how to use my body to do stuff quite well, though admittedly my spatial awareness is a bit horrible sometimes. I do draw sometimes and it's quite fun, so if that counts, I do work with my hands. \n\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art\nplease likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI think I am artistic. I like to create conlangs (constructed languages) that look like naturalistic, unsuspecting languages, but hide in their patterns and vocab little nuggets about how I see the world. because languages are really just different slices of the same world-sized pizza, so why not make my own?\nI also draw sometimes as I said, but I just draw my Wings of Fire OCs like \"ooh Kastano n anhydron go kissy kissy\" most of the time. it fun.\n\n\n\u2022What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI feel like they're all equally important to understanding the whole, though I do give priority to the present and future, since it's the things I can readily manipulate, not the have-beens and the can't-changes of the past. I also wonder a lot about different possible pasts, how they could've affected the present, etc. as for how I deal with them, I think I try to use the present to my advantage to try and manipulate and steer the future in a positive direction, and I learn lessons from the past.\n\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI would think about it for a moment, then accept if feasible. else I'd politely decline and offer alternatives. I think. I would just help them because I can help them; they need help, I offer it. I want to see them succeed.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nby this I assume routine, and honestly I don't usually keep a routine. like, I do write down all my homework in a piece of paper as to not forget, but that's about it. it's all in my head. routine doesn't give me my space for \u2728creativity\u2728.\n\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nit's certainly important, however it seems to me society asks for both of those things from people like me who prefer to do their own thing and just chill out, which I see the harm in that. it's telling people to be things they don't want to be to fit into a model imposed by the stronger. it's living life in a fake way, in my opinion. I think everyone should pursue their own personalised happiness and fulfillment.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nwell, sometimes I do do that by manipulating my environment and way of being to make a person feel a certain way about something, but only to help them or for a better cause.... I think. maybe I have done it for my own happiness sometimes, but I don't think I have.\n\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nmy main hobby is linguistics, specifically the fields of phonetics and historical linguistics. I really enjoy seeing things evolve and play out and change and see the similarities and origins of things we take for granted. it's also a nice exercise for seeing the world from different perspectives.\n\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI'm not really sure what my learning style is, I have found however that subconscious learning, where I forget I'm learning something, has worked for me in many different situations. I really struggle with drill-based classrooms and work for the sake of working, it takes away all my interest in learning. if I can be creative and fun with the thing I'm learning, it's going to be a lot easier for me to learn.\n\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nhonestly, depends. but generalizing a bit, I first break objects into manageable tasks.... to then completely ignore my checklist and do whatever and fix whatever imperfections there are at the end. that's actually how I've been answering this lol.\n\n\n\u2022 What's important to you and why?\n\nprobably truth and freedom are my two most important values. I feel like life is fake in a way without them, and I don't want life to be fake.\n\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations?\n\nI wish to study at the university of Helsinki, and I have everything calculated so I can get there and stay up. I also want to get a friend group of people I connect with, which I am working on doing. I want to master my hobbies to be a knowledgeable person prepared for life.\n\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear being left out, seen as useless, being judged behind my back, insulted... I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone. the sound of people chewing makes me really uncomfortable and annoyed, it's just so eugh.\n\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\ntimes when I felt happy and connected with the people and things around me, when love surrounded me and my soul.\n\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nthe opposite of that. dark times without anyone understanding or appreciating my existence, hate all around me, feeling judged and rejected. Feeling useless myself.\n\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI am not that attached to reality. I daydream a lot every day, at the bus, in the car, before bed, it's just something that comes out naturally. and I'm slightly aware of my surroundings while I do so, like, I know whether I'm in a bus or my bed, and if that guy is gonna sit beside me or not.\n\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nagain, depends. probably about something I was thinking about the other day, or a problem I have, or just the people close to me. I daydream about lots of things. also I'd probably ask myself why I'm in a blank room with nothing for me to do and no-one to talk to. \n\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nstory of my life. I'm very very very indecisive, and I usually have these \"instant regret\" moments after taking a decision, where I momentarily think the other choice would've been better in the long run or something.\n\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI need as much alone time as I can get tbh. emotions are a really big part of me I think. I try to keep everyone happy, including myself, and raise spirits and help others develop into their best selves.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nnot really. If I have a strong opinion on something, chances are I'm going to voice it regardless. I think everyone has their own view of life and existence, and that it should be shared and accepted if not inherently bad or hurtful as to understand different perspectives and improve one's own to find \"the real truth\", whatever that is.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nrules that are chosen for a reasonable reason and that can be applied as universals are fair, in my opinion. and they should be followed. now, the rules I have no problem breaking are those established so that the power-hungry can get more power. you know what I'm talking about. they're inherently bad and unjust, and something should be done about them.\n\n\n\u2022 What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nkissanp\u00e4iv\u00e4t. time for myself. stable job and house. comfortable everywhere. no judgment from others. my friends are close to me and true. I enjoy my occupation and have time for my hobbies.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/170ugyk)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.0587372}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -1.183968}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.584864}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.4414697}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -3.5871224}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.3157315}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -5.349421}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.562968}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -5.634938}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.970425}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.3963532}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -6.964806}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.047642}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.2330937}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.605231}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -7.832129}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -8.347103}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.362831}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.515354}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -9.050951}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.004877808}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -5.6623926}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -6.994462}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.70371}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.2798815}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -9.870795}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.513429}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -10.747315}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -11.123984}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -11.221787}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -11.573613}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -11.587127}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -12.0881815}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -12.165204}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -12.411302}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -12.427848}, {"token": "t", "logprob": -12.429162}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -12.707371}, {"token": "_", "logprob": -12.823203}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -12.965338}]}}

{"submission": "Hey everyone ! This is my first Reddit post :)\nSo, I\u2019ve been really into MBTI for months now but I\u2019m not sure about my type. Like a lot of ppl, I\u2019ve been mistyped on 16p as INFP but as I dug into cognitive functions, I started thinking that I was ISFP. But I need confirmation from people that probably know more things about MBTI than me..\n\n/!\\ I\u2019m sorry this post is so long, and thank you to all of those who will take time out to read and maybe type me :)\n\n\n\n\n- How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m 18F. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m great at expressing myself through words so excuse me if I\u2019m not very clear (+ English isn\u2019t my first language, so don\u2019t hesitate to correct any grammar errors !!)\n\nI would say that I\u2019m overly kind to everyone (even people that don\u2019t deserve any sympathy, I still see qualities in anyone), I\u2019m always here to help my friends - e.g notes, revision sheets for exams or love advice.\nBut I worked on it since middle school and now I can say no when it crosses my boundaries and I stopped being a total people pleaser. Now idc of what people think of me and I\u2019m so much happier since.\n\nI\u2019m someone who likes being alone and I\u2019m a homebody but I still love visiting and walking around cities.\nI don\u2019t particularly enjoy socializing but I still do it pretty often, I love talking to people about everything, discovering new things or sharing my interests. I\u2019m not really shy but more \u00ab\u00a0introverted\u00a0\u00bb or reserved so I don\u2019t really share personal matters, thoughts etc (I don\u2019t like people knowing too much, and being seen as weak)\n\nI can be really stubborn about some topics I can be a pain in the ahh to convince. I\u2019m lowkey competitive as hell (I get sulky when I lose, I just HATE the feeling of losing a game). And I swear a lot.\nI also love gossip (ik it\u2019s bad but it\u2019s so entertaining \ud83d\ude2d)\nI would say that I\u2019m a chill person overall.\n\n\n\n\n- Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental comportamental stability somehow?\n\nAs far as I know, I don\u2019t have any type of medical diagnosis that could impact my behavior. Ofc it\u2019s not impossible but very unlikely in my case.\n\n\n\n\n- Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nIn my family, we\u2019re pretty much all christians. I was raised with religious morals but not extreme at all, I was taught values and morals like courage, love, respect, do no harm etc. So it only brought me positive values that I still apply to this day because it just makes sense for everyone, religious or not. \n\nI\u2019m so lucky to have a family like mine but my parents have two different parenting style : \nMy mom has a pedagogical parenting style. She establishes a certain framework for our safety, only punishing us when we do something stupid (like putting ourselves in danger unnecessarily) and is very attentive to our emotions. In short, a dream mum. I have a very close relationship with her and I\u2019m not afraid of being completely open with her about my emotions and thoughts. We tell each other EVERYTHING. My love language is physical touch so we hug a lot and I kiss her forehead a lot. I literally cannot live without her, I was so anxious to move for my studies last month and I call her every single day when I\u2019m not back at home.\n\nMy dad has more a detached parenting style. Unlike my mom, he is not someone who likes to express their emotions (besides anger lmaoo). He doesn\u2019t ask questions about school except for what I ate, he doesn\u2019t know my besties names, he doesn't treat my mother the way she deserves to be treated (as the queen she is). He still assures for my safety because he loves me, but he never shows it like I would like him to (he doesn\u2019t kiss my cheek and he hugged me recently because I moved but except for that\u2026 we don\u2019t have any physical contact). We argued a lot during my puberty because I stood up a lot more for my beliefs that weren\u2019t the same as his. But I still love him a lot.\n\n\n\n\n- What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI\u2019m studying psychology ! I just started last month but it is so so interesting so far and I love it so much like- it's so reassuring to know that I haven't made a mistake about my future career.\nI love studying the human mind, mental health and pathologies, how to help people get better and different types of therapies, influences we are unaware of and how to detach ourselves for society\u2019s norms\u2026 it\u2019s so fascinating.

{"submission": "\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. \n\nI'm a 16 year old male. I've got a very melancholic temperament most of the time, but it's quite internal, I've been told I can be bossy and uncaring outwardly sometimes when I care about something, but when I don't I tend to be very laid back. I like writing... I mostly like writing in my head though haha, I rarely ever get anything out, my execution ability is... I don't want to say it's bad? Because I've never really tried, but, I have such a perfect layout of a plot for like an entire book in my head but it's so vague, when I actually attempt to lay it out I realise how little I have actually really thought it out - I mean this in the sense that I always only seem to have a \"general vibe\" and for some reason I always just see the end of the book, I know exactly how I want people to feel towards the ending.\n\n \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nGreat honestly! At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI think I'd like it... I usually get very tired just from the outside world... I always get home from college basically dead haha...\n\n \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious! I think? I love coming up with ideas, I think the way I view the world is probably the core of my entire identity. I have a very very strange way of seeing things I think... I came up with a concept recently that I found super interesting. I have a few in mind after saying that so I'm just gonna flip a coin to decide lmao. Okay, this one - so I was wondering initially (this is what led me to the final though) \"if someone gets put on a machine that makes them feel unfathomably good, and then get taken off of it and given the chance to stay off or go back on, do they have a choice or does their external environment just command them?\". This led me to come up with a better version: (imo) if someone came into my home, put a gun to my head and demanded I do an extremely simple task, or I die - and I have completely free will (atleast theoretically) to make whichever choice I wanted - do I actually have free will? If I value my life, logic commands me to complete the task - lets say its something extremely simple like there are no cons to completing it, like say, touching the wall in front of me - all logic commands me to complete that task. But in a way that isn't me making a decision is it? I'm being commanded by the circumstances of my external environment. So my idea was what if we made that pointless, unreasonable choice, just because? It's an absurd reasoning, sure, but a very human one imo.\n\n \n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot really, I mean, I can at times and I think I like doing things in my own way - honestly though I've never really been put to the test? And when I do get put into positions of leadership I get incredibly bossy and critical, I hate it.\n\n \n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not gonna go into much depth but I feel like it was worth touching on - I dislike it, a lot, although when I was a kid I remember loving to climb trees, building lego I mean until I turned around 14, I wanted to be a mechanic!\n\n \n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI think I do in a sense, yeah. I sometimes will say things just because I know that person will like me for it. I'm not a people pleaser in the slightest - in fact I actually can sometimes cause conflict just for the sake of it: like I remember often in highschool my friendgroup would come ask me to come out and even if I really wanted to, sometimes I'd just refuse... out of a sort of spite I think? But like I remember in school when I wanted to become popular, I sat next to a popular kid and analysed what kinda jokes made him laugh, I then made LOTS of those jokes and it worked!\n\n \n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have EXTREMELY high highs, like seriously. I mean. I even often have them in lows sort of? I sometimes dive into extremely cynical pits of sadness and I can often criticise people for just \"believing\" things - like saying \"oh I believe love is a powerful energy force\", I'm usually just like \"huh? How can you believe that?\" but I really do have moments where I think I get it! I just think sense drags me back down, which sucks a little I guess. I often get very weirded out by the notion of love, it can (and sometimes does) upset me greatly after those moments of \"highs\" when I come to the realisation that love is really all their is to live; I really hate the notion that \"happiness is the meaning to life\", I don't want to explain that but I hate it.\n\n \n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nNot very at all... I used to be! When I was a kid. And I remember in highschool I would always get terrified of being seen daydreaming so I just wouldn't. I remember fearing looking like my mum. I love her! So much, don't get me wrong, but she would always do this thing where she would just stare off into the distance and not think... I always wondered why she did that but I hated it, I didn't want to look like that.\n\nThank you so so so so so much for reading this!

{"submission": "Hey everyone! As the title says, I\u2019m struggling to pinpoint what my type is. To summarize my personality. I\u2019m a fairly reserved person and I\u2019m pretty shy, but I\u2019m far from a misanthrope. I\u2019ve always had a great deal of empathy and when I\u2019m with people I\u2019m comfortable with I can be the loudest and most energetic person in the room. In the small talk stage of a conversation, I\u2019m awkward and not a very skilled communicator, but I excel in debates and generally intellectually stimulating conversations, and I\u2019d say I\u2019m a pretty good story teller as well. Basically, I crave conversations with others that have substance but I\u2019m a little too shy and reserved to ever get there with a lot of people.\n\nOn top of that, I\u2019m very interested in world events and I myself am interested in a political career, prior to that I was interested in journalism. My ultimate and simultaneously selfish and selfless desire in life is to influence and change human society in a positive way; a way that\u2019d cement my place in history and ensure I\u2019d obtain the respect I feel I deserve, while also allowing me to address the problems in the world that make me so angry. I\u2019m frustratingly unmotivated and lazy, though, and this actively sabotages my (hypothetical) attempts to achieving my goals. Both my shyness and lack of motivation frustrate me greatly and I\u2019ve taken active steps towards working on them so I can hopefully eventually mold myself into the type of person needed to achieve the things I wish to.\n\nI\u2019m well aware that my ambitions are quite unrealistic and I may be setting myself up for disappointment and dissatisfaction, but I\u2019d feel that if I never tried anyway so I might as well work towards it. I\u2019m always living in my head, thinking about any number of random things, frequently about the future though and what positions I might find myself in. These are more daydreams than plans, though. If you need me to elaborate on anything, or have any questions, feel free to ask.

{"submission": "My dad passed away nearly 5 years ago now, and I would like to type him to better understand his past actions and thought processes.\n\n- He was very sporty and active when he was younger. He especially did a lot of basketball and martial arts and had a 6 pack. Played more golf when he was older and participated in golf competitions too.\n\n- He told us a lot of stories from the past, of other people and of himself, and the lessons he wanted us to learn from them.\n\n- Had anger issues and a short temper very sporadically.\n\n- He was a successful businessman, and the money he earned he would always reinvest back into the business (rather than in assets/property).\n\n- He liked adventures and experiences, would go explore new sights such as cliffs and rivers. Liked travelling.\n\n- Liked buying luxury items. He would never skimp when buying things, would always buy the best or near best products he could afford. Often thought more expensive = better. He liked to buy things for the sake of buying things (perhaps it was newness of them that he liked).\n\n- Held cultural events and traditions to great importance. We would always celebrate cultural holidays properly (i.e., buying all the proper decorations and having the proper traditional kitchenware).\n\n- Didn\u2019t show emotion a lot.\n\n- Was a very honest and principled man. Once a solicitor undercharged us by nearly \u00a31000, we went back to pay them the full amount. I think he did believe in karma.\n\n- Used to do calligraphy.\n\n- Placed heavy emphasis on filial piety when we were growing up.\n\n- Would buy us a lot of random gifts, even whenever he went to the supermarket (e.g., I had a phase where I liked candles a lot and he probably bought me about 5 candles across different occasions).\n\n- Trusted traditional medicine much more than modern medicine. This probably applies to other things as well.\n\n\nIn the last few years of his life, I think he was a very unhealthy version of himself (didn\u2019t help that he had health issues so that he couldn\u2019t do all the things he used to do. He would get frustrated about this a lot). My best memories of him come from this time, when I was a teenager, so my recollection could be off.\n\nI am thinking ISTJ, the things that are stopping me are that my dad seemed to have strong Se, and I also don\u2019t really understand the Te function (I don\u2019t have it in my own stack).

And so, I\"ll grant society the perspective of my values, and I see that as my evolutionary duty.

{"submission": "Hello! mbti is something I have always heard about but never really gotten into until recently, and I've been trying to type myself with no luck (I'm still very new so I'm not suprised but I thought I'd give it a shot) so I did the Type Me questionnaire to see what you guys think!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI\u2019m 23, I\u2019m a woman, and I\u2019m currently out of college, and I\u2019m working at a country club in administration. I have a simple life, but I like it that way. I still live with my parents temporarily until I can save up enough money to move out. I basically go to work, go home, play video games, read, and talk to my parents and my friends and my boyfriend.\n\n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was very traditional with nothing out of the ordinary. My childhood was mostly calm and I was a very sheltered kid. The worst thing that happened during my childhood was that my parents would argue a lot at times, but it didn\u2019t really affect me super negatively.\n\nI had a very large religious influence. My mom was teaching me how to sing Christian songs before I could talk and taking me to church before I could even remember it. I grew up in the typical Christian Southern American home basically. When I was very young I responded well to it because it was all I knew, really. I didn\u2019t even consider or think about any other possibilities because I was around it so much as a kid. However, in high school I joined a Christian youth group that really turned me off to Christianity in general. It was a toxic place that had me feeling guilty for stupid shit and it was also super cliquey which I did not enjoy. I eventually stopped going there and then stopped going to church altogether. This was met with little resistance by my parents because mom had stopped going to church years ago just because she didn\u2019t feel like waking up early on a Sunday, which is very fair. I hated it too.   \n\n* **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI work in administration at a country club. It is an OK job, but I definitely do not want to do this for the rest of my life. I think it bothers me the most because it\u2019s like, sort of customer service but not fully? For example, my day-to-day is I sit at my desk and work on different administrative tasks and answer the phone. However, if a member of the country club comes up to my desk I\u2019m obviously expected to help them. I hate that part so much because it just feels like I\u2019m constantly getting interrupted by whatever I\u2019m doing. I know that this isn\u2019t caused by a general dislike of customer service, though, because before this job I was a waitress for 4 years and I loved it. I think my brain has to sort of be in that \u201ccustomer service\u201d mode to be able to handle it easily/enjoy it. When I\u2019m trying to work and people come up to me asking dumb questions or trying to make small-talk when I genuinely don\u2019t care it annoys me a bit. I also don\u2019t like that I don\u2019t have an office. I\u2019m at the front desk so everyone who walks in, walks by, or anything comes into contact with me and it makes me tense for some reason. I do like the administrative work aspect of the job, though. I love spreadsheets, data entry, updating the restaurant\u2019s POS system, etc etc. I think I would enjoy my job much more if it was more secluded.\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel refreshed for sure. I\u2019ve always been good at keeping myself company. Honestly, unless it\u2019s my boyfriend, my social battery is usually super low. I like talking to friends and seeing them, but I can never do it for a long time or super often. I burn out very quickly.\n\n* **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI don\u2019t really prefer any sort of physically demanding activities except for maybe working out. I used to really enjoy the gym a couple years ago and I\u2019ve been meaning to go back. Otherwise, I prefer relaxing activities like watching anime or reading or playing games. I also enjoy stuff like shopping or going out to eat somewhere. I used to be rly good at softball when I was younger, but I haven\u2019t played since my sophomore year of high school. I really, really enjoyed it though. \n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am a curious person. I really like to learn about new things. I\u2019m super interested in space and the mysteries around it, as well as more far-fetched ideas that I don\u2019t necessarily believe in, but I just think they\u2019re fun to learn about. Some of these include stuff like cryptids, conspiracy theories, weird disappearances/unexplainable events, etc etc.\n\nI definitely have more ideas than I can execute. I have a lot of random aspirations and hobbies I want to try that will probably not go anywhere because it isn\u2019t humanly possible to do such a diverse amount of things. If I wrote down all of them it would sound like I want to become my Skyrim character.\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI don\u2019t think I would enjoy nor be good at a leadership position. The thought of having to make decisions for an entire group of people doesn\u2019t sound like something I\u2019m good at nor does it sound appealing at all.\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI can be coordinated in some ways, and not coordinated in others. Even though I love video games, I\u2019m not very good at them, at least not naturally. If I want to improve or get good at a video game I have to try really hard and play a lot. I also tend to drop or knock into things often in my day-to-day life. However, as I mentioned before, I was really good at softball, which requires coordination. I don\u2019t really like working with my hands in activities such as crafts. I tend to get impatient quickly as I\u2019m also not good at things like that.\n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI am generally not an artistic person. I have always wanted to learn how to draw, but I never have taken the time to learn. That being said, I also just am generally not creative with visual arts. Most of my time spent learning how to draw was to just draw my favorite fictional characters or something similar, but I never had super creative original ideas that I wanted to paint or draw. However, I used to enjoy creative writing a lot. I used to write a lot of short stories based on one-sentence prompts. Those were always super fun to do. I have also had novel ideas back in early high school that had me feeling very inspired to write, but I never got far with them.\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe Past: I see it as a learning tool for the most part. I try to learn from my past mistakes and experiences, however I don\u2019t always do so. The past is also crippling for me at times, because I sometimes can take great measures to avoid the bad parts of my past repeating, which usually aren\u2019t needed nor helpful. They could even cause a self-fulfilling prophecy. I use the past as a tool, but the past also usually is a big cause of my anxiety\n\nThe Present: I am most at peace when thinking about the present because it is the only one I can actively control. I know exactly what\u2019s going on and I can still control my actions, whereas in the past you can\u2019t, and the future is unknown. I tend to just let the present go past me without paying much attention to anything other than what I\u2019m doing or who I\u2019m with.\n\nThe Future: How I feel about my future changes with my mood or mental disposition. I can look at my future and be excited and hopeful one day and be anxious and fearful the next. It genuinely depends on my outlook at the current moment, which usually is determined by my mental health and environment. The biggest thing I don\u2019t like about the future is the unknown. The unknown aspect of the future makes me feel uneasy.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIt really depends on the person and the task. With people closest to me, I will do nearly anything to help them if I can, and if a stranger really needed my help with something and didn\u2019t seem suspicious I would help them as well. I generally like to be a helpful person, but of course I have limits and they change depending on the person and the request. My general reasoning would be out of love/care for the person, or because it\u2019s the nice/right thing to do and it doesn\u2019t inconvenience me much.\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI strive for logical consistency, but it is hard for me to stay completely logical when I need to be. I tend to let my emotions get in the way of my logical or sometimes even rational thoughts, and I let those lead me to my conclusions/decisions rather than logic.\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nProductivity is important to me. I\u2019m generally a lazy person, but I strive for productivity and generally use it as a way of measuring how \u201ctogether\u201d my life is. For example, if I\u2019m following a daily routine and sleeping healthily and making sure I need to get everything on my to-do list done, I generally just think more highly of myself than if I did the bare minimum. I think about it a lot and it\u2019s a lot of the reason why I focus so much on lists and routines, because it\u2019s an ideal that I see as very important to me, even if I don\u2019t always achieve it.\n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI generally do not control other people\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy hobbies are playing video games, reading, and watching anime. I like all of these hobbies for the same reasons. I love them because they\u2019re cozy, relaxing, and I can experience whole other worlds through each medium. Video games are less this way, because I don\u2019t play a lot of story-based games. Video games for me are more about being competitive or keeping my hands busy.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI\u2019m honestly better at strategizing how I\u2019m going to accomplish a task than I am doing the task itself. I\u2019ll sit down to do something and spend more time planning it than actually working on it. I really like to-do lists and breaking things down into smaller tasks, but sometimes I can get too focused on it and not focused enough on what I actually need to do.\n\n* **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nProfessionally, I\u2019m still working that out. I am pretty sure I want to go into law, but I don\u2019t know if I want to be a full-on lawyer or just a paralegal, or something similar. I also sometimes think about taking on/trying out other career paths, but I don\u2019t stress too much about it because I don\u2019t really feel the need to be some sort of bigshot or crazy rich person. I don\u2019t really care if I\u2019m in love with my career, and I definitely don\u2019t want to make it my whole life. I just don\u2019t want to hate it, and I want to be able to make enough money to live comfortably.\n\nPersonally, I want to improve myself. I don\u2019t really have a goal in mind, I just want to always try to improve myself at least a little bit as life goes on. Otherwise it\u2019s pretty simple: I want to have a home with my husband and one or two kids. I want to have enough money so that we don\u2019t have to worry about our next paycheck, and I don\u2019t really need or want much else.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI have a big fear of vomiting for some reason, which I have never really understood. The only thing I can think of is the fact that it\u2019s very unpleasant coupled with the fact that I can\u2019t control it if it\u2019s happening to me, once someone actually begins to vomit you can\u2019t stop it. I am also afraid of spiders and heights but those are much less severe. I also have a big fear of abandonment because of stuff that happened in my childhood, and that is very prevalent in my life unfortunately. It can make my anxiety act up pretty severely at times.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nI\u2019m usually very energetic or very relaxed. I\u2019m feeling good about myself and my relationships. I don\u2019t have any sort of work or difficult task coming up. I\u2019m feeling loved and warm!\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nHigh anxiety, low self esteem, low self confidence. I\u2019m thinking a lot of self-deprecating thoughts and generally experiencing bits of self-hatred. I have no motivation to even get out of bed and I can\u2019t stop crying. All of my responsibilities sort of fall away as well.\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI honestly daydream any chance I get. If I want to pass the time and can\u2019t access my phone for whatever reason I instantly start daydreaming. I daydream at work, when I\u2019m bored, when I\u2019m trying to sleep I think up fun scenarios in my head. I am capable of daydreaming and being aware of my surroundings if the daydream isn\u2019t deep enough, but more often than not I lose a lot of my awareness.\n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nHonestly probably the things I\u2019m going to want to do as soon as I get out. I would daydream about those things to pass the time.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI take a bit to make an important decision. I really want to be 100% sure of the decision I\u2019m going to make before I make it. Not only do I take the time to think it through, but I also often procrastinate even thinking about it. However, once I do make a decision, I don\u2019t change my mind. If I do, it\u2019s very rare.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?** \n\nI tend to be very in touch with my emotions because I\u2019m a very emotional person, sometimes to a fault. I\u2019m usually very aware of how I\u2019m feeling and why, and my feelings are usually strong and can change pretty quickly\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI only do that if I know it isn\u2019t worth arguing about. Like if I know someone is wrong about something trivial that I don\u2019t really care about, I\u2019ll pretend to be oblivious just because starting an argument isn\u2019t worth it in my eyes just to prove them wrong. Otherwise I usually state my opinions on things.\n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI feel like we need rules, but just because we need rules doesn\u2019t mean they all need to be followed, because some rules are dumb and some authority figures are dumb, but I do believe that the structure is needed or else the world would be too chaotic. However, I do have a tendency to comply to rules whether I agree with them or not, unless I know I can break them without getting caught (only in very mild circumstances like texting in class or something similar LOL). An exception would be a rule that goes strongly against my base morals or beliefs.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": "ISFP", "logprobs": {"IS": [{"token": "IS", "logprob": -0.55040354}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.4476566}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.75313}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -3.1348343}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.2904606}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -3.912447}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -4.5578594}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.934206}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -6.304594}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.3306503}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -6.611109}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -6.6339912}, {"token": " ES", "logprob": -7.0371666}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.4672127}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.7769794}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.9760857}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -8.265295}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -8.626528}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -8.893553}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -9.01054}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.5458663}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -0.86601096}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.535652}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -11.605417}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -12.330219}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -13.669355}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -13.984154}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.383137}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -14.39999}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -14.483175}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -14.492054}, {"token": "PF", "logprob": -14.73925}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -14.767393}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -14.79192}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -14.949949}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -14.963869}, {"token": "DJ", "logprob": -15.150124}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -15.366315}, {"token": "NJ", "logprob": -15.387568}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -15.515195}]}}
{"submission": "Note: I tested as so many types from ISTP, INFP, ENFJ to most recently ENTP. \n\n- Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m not very good at describing myself, and I always have to pause to think before answering. My initial answer was uuuuh, me? I don\u2019t really feel like I have a lot to say about myself other than I\u2019m a person currently on reddit.\n\n- Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNone. \n\n- Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nVery emotionally neglected I was a pretty sensitive child who wanted to share my feelings and inner world. I didn\u2019t get too because of a toxic mother who used to yell at me if I showed any emotion. I thought she was so immature as a kid, and I still think so now. I learned to shut up and move on. I don\u2019t really now how to express my feelings now either, not that I really want too. As for my Dad he was good not really emotionally loving either but at least he listened. I don\u2019t have much memories of my life so I can\u2019t add anymore. \n\nReligion. I liked it as a kid, doubted it as a teen and early adult. Now it feels completely foreign to me and I have zero interest in it. \n\n- What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nCurrently a student. History major and I like it after jumping around majors. I either want to be a history teacher or english teacher aboard. I also draw which I want to do as a side gig, and I\u2019m currently creating a visual novel. \n\n- If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI bounce between loving it, and then missing people. Most of the time I want space to my own. Though, I like having other people in my house around me just not talking to me haha. \n\n- What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nMostly indoor. Games, art, cooking, writing etc. I\u2019m neutral in sports they can be fun to play, but I don\u2019t go out of my way to play them. As a kid I liked to be active. \n\n- How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI\u2019m pretty curious. I like talking, and learning new things\u2014 until I don\u2019t then I get tired, and don\u2019t care. It tends to be around my hobbies or major, though I like learning random fun facts. My ideas are all centered around art or my future life. \n\n- Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo. Unless that means I do everything myself because I\u2019m a bit of a control freak. \n\n- Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI am somewhat? I trip over things often, but not as often as my INFP sibling. I don\u2019t really have much experiences with working with my hands, so maybe?! \n\n- Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nArtistic-ish. I just draw whatever I like and whatever will make me money. \n\n- What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n- past: something I don\u2019t really remember personally, but something that is important to society. If we don\u2019t remember our past then how do we move forward without repeating those mistakes. \n- Present: boring, but I have to do it. \n- Future: Where all my wants and wishes are. \n\n- How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI don\u2019t mind helping people and it doesn\u2019t bother me unless its something I CAN\u2019T do then I would want them to do ask someone else.  \n\n- Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n- I need things to make sense, so if that counts yes. \n\n- How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI imagine myself being very efficient, but I can never seem to do it.  \n\n- Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n- I don\u2019t think so. \n\n- What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n I am a visual and auditory learner. I did really well in classes with open discussions, I really loved doing those classes. If I class didn\u2019t have that then I found them boring. I tended to do well on classes if I felt like I could do them as well. \n\n- What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI do have some FOMO or getting murdered. \n\n- How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nAbout 50/50. I daydream pretty often. \n\n- How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI make them at a snap of a finger, regret it, need to talk about it, change my mind. Then rinse and repeat 20x until I actually make that decision. \n\n- How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t process them. Unless randomly getting hit with them right before bed. \n\n- Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don\u2019t break rules, but I find an easier way to do something I\u2019ll do it. Yes if they\u2019re being idiots then its fair game. They don\u2019t always know better but I don\u2019t disrespect them either.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.36125365}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -2.3387585}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.4083214}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -2.6440754}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -4.743454}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -4.795265}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.1051884}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -5.1514244}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -5.6442833}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -5.6487293}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -6.054714}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.2043705}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.4068794}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.0255203}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.213848}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -8.582586}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -8.6374035}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -8.687979}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.69137}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.826185}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0028783418}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.021349}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.260584}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -9.215668}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.330389}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -10.344381}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.503923}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -12.092131}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.045813}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.652866}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.949053}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -14.379299}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -14.650127}, {"token": "SP", "logprob": -14.74412}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.847227}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -15.0026455}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -15.164877}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -15.335136}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -15.5723915}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -15.780724}]}}
{"submission": "&#x200B;\n\n* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nIm 23, male from Europe, not very tall and slim (my metabolism be fast af), generally lazy and trying to enjoy life. I wear mostly black clothes and jeans and used to paint my nails black because I'm emo/goth lol.\n\n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo, but I feel like I might have ADHD since I always fidget with random stuff and I was also severely depressed (borderline suicidal) when I was 16 but haven't had those thoughts since then.\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was kind of erratic in the sense that my parents didn't really have much time for me and when I was very young I had abandonment issues and would cry in the kindergarten because the kids were mostly annoying. My grandma would take me to a local internet cafe where I would spend my time playing video games aside from watching cartoons. She also took me to church a couple times when I was a kid but I would just play with the other kids and there were also toys on the first floor, I never really understood it and I feel like I've always been an atheist. \n\nMy parents are very odd type of people - my father lives in the past and when I was little, we would just watch the same movies and stuff over and over but eventually I grew out of that and I look for something novel, for example I can't watch the same movies more than 1-2 times.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI graduated computer science this year and currently work as a junior software developer in the DevOps field and I do like it though my impostor syndrome kicks off quite a lot. Yesterday we started working on a project and I was the main dude working on the terminal and had the other 3 developers whine about every little error I make or that I'm being \"too fast\" to write stuff as if I have 0 clue what I'm doing, it kind of felt like I'm taking a technical interview. Other than that it's pretty chill, people are mostly nice except my manager. I won a hackathon that was hosted by the university and he decided that he would assign me to a project that's beyond my capabilities so there's high expectations. I just hope I don't burn out or I get fired for the time being, since I'm still a newcomer.\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel refreshed for sure. I just clock out at 6pm from work and do my stuff, maybe cook something or watch anime and talk to my girlfriend and maybe play some games then go sleep. It does get lonely since I don't have a lot of friends but my girlfriend and my best friend make up for it, for the most part. \n\n* **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI wouldn't say I'm good at sports, though I did enjoy playing basketball at high school and university. I also used to be somewhat decent as a goalkeeper in high school but only for the P.E. classes, nothing beyond that. I never wanted to go to a competition or whatever. However I've always wanted to do some kind of martials arts like muay thai but I never took the chance to since I get lazy very easily and I feel it it would drain me mentally even more. I used to get in fights in high school with friends but I'm not really the violent type since everything can be resolved by using words, e.g diplomatically. I see violence as a final resort, in general.\n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nAlthough I see myself as a curious person, I tend to filter some information nowadays that simply does not interest me, such as news or fashion or whatever it may be, if I'm interested in it, I will research as much as I want/will. I do have a lot of ideas/theories but those are more correlated to like conspiracies or unpopular opinions. I feel like most people have no ability to think for themselves and just become sheep just to appeal to society's standards. \n\nI'm curious about history, astronomy/space, tech, video games, scenarios that could or may not happen like \"what if\" scenarios. I space out quite a lot when I'm watching anime or doing whatever, I get lost in thought easily. \n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI think I would take a leadership position if there's no one else to take the initiative but normally if there's someone that is already knowledgeable and worthy to be a leader, I'd follow him. I wouldn't want to be a leader for as long as if I have to. I feel like my leadership style would be to reach the objective we've set. When I was in university I hated project assignments because I would have to manage everything usually and I'd rather just do it myself at that point. If I can do it on my own then I'm gonna do it on my own.\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not really coordinated, sometimes when I'm outside and thinking about stuff I zone out and I trip on the street or when I'm at home I often times eat while I'm moving back and forth because I'm thinking about something, I forget my surroundings a lot. One time I had to run an errand for my mother and I couldn't find my wallet even though I looked pretty much everywhere that I could think of and then once I went to the store with the jacket I normally wore at the time it was apparently in my pocket the entire time...Also when I forget stuff like if I forget where my phone or keys are I try to rewind to where I went or what I did most recently and track my actions to find where something is. I don't really enjoy working with my hands because I am anxious and stability is not one of my core strengths which is probably why I would never be a photographer or something.\n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI used to draw when I was younger and I was somewhat good at it but I never really saw it something \"deep\" or impressive. I just drew whatever I could picture that would look cool but I find art, especially nowadays to be ambiguous as in modern art is not really art-art. I mean c'mon, a banana taped to a wall is art now? Or hell those artists that spin around a bucket over a canvas and call it a day...yeah no. I like Salvador Dali because his art is not visually appealing to the eye but I also find it abstract.\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe Past: I try not to look into the past often unless it's for nostalgia reasons, I associate it with troubles or mistakes or whatever in that regard otherwise. When I think of the past in general I see it as what has shaped me into the person that I currently am and try not to dwell too much on it since it's already gone and it doesn't help me at all.\n\nThe Present: I see it as the opportunities that I can either seize or choose not to. Everything is constantly changing and it makes me excited for new things to have because everyday is something novel especially since I work in tech. But not only that, people/news/articles and everything change right by second so it's constant and sometimes I find it exhausting if anything.\n\nThe Future: It changes depends on how I feel, however for the most part I see it as a dystopia, even though some parts may be good about it. For example, in the future most stuff we do or that people used to do will be automated by machines, one way or another. Which would lead to a larger recession that we currently have, however the mentality of people might also change to make them strive to do better instead of relying on robots to do everything for them. I get FOMO a lot, especially about space, things that I would never witness, such as Andromeda colliding with our universe or Mount Rushmore ceasing to exist or whatever. There's a reason why I used to watch Vsauce so much, not because of the great information he delivers but also because the topics were very interesting even if one could not experience them thoroughly. For me personally, I want to become an expert in my field and hopefully have a family, visit some countries, etc. I have always wanted to visit Egypt and Japan and it's part of my many dreams.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIt depends on what they're asking me to do and who is asking me to do it. If it's at work obviously I will do it but depending on whether it's a friend or not I could just say \"nah\" or \"idk im too busy\" but then if they try to still force it upon me I might slack off on purpose or just forget to do it. If I decide to help someone I would do it because I deem them important and it also depends again on what \"help\" is meant, it could mean anything. I love helping with providing information but I try not to get physical when I have to or with advice.\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nBeing logical is what I try to do most of the time, though I second guess myself a lot because one solution could always be worse/better than another solution later on. What I mean is, one shouldn't immediately call it a day once a solution has been found, unless there's no other solution to be thought of. I try to be practical with my decisions, even though sometimes I buy stuff that I don't necessarily need but I still get them because they give me a sense of thrill.\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI try to be productive and I don't like postponing or delaying too much because it makes me very anxious as in that I won't be able to do it in time. If I can do it early and have it gone out of my head then that's great. I don't want to be seen as incompetent so I strive to learn as much as I can and apply it in practice where possible.\n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI wouldn't say I control others but I may or may not have indirectly manipulated someone without me knowing. I'm not really a bossy type though, if I can do something then I'll do it myself. I wouldn't really ask someone to run an errand for me unless I have a medical problem or idk.\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy hobbies are playing video games, listening to music, watching anime/vids. I like them because they make me relax and I don't have to think as much or at all when doing them, unless I'm playing a tactical shooter or a strategy game, such as chess or w/e. I loved metal construction sets as a kid and tinkering with random stuff, because every new thing I haven't touched before was interesting to me.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI'm mostly a visual learner using logic and memory, kind of, though mostly for things I'm genuinely interested in. I learn by doing and by seeing stuff and memorizing a ton of details and the likes is not one of my core strengths. I could remember stuff from years ago that actually interested me, such as a random fact/equation/quote, etc. but stuff that I dislike and didn't find enjoyable doesn't stick with me.\n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nNo, I don't strategize I just go with the flow and see what happens, I don't plan because that drains me mentally and if I could get by without planning I will. I would definitely say I wing projects and improvise, well I improvise at whatever I can, actually.\n\n* **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nAs I mentioned before, I want to become a professional in my field of work and personally I just want to enjoy life and experience new things before it I'm gone.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI have FOMO (as mentioned) and being alone, I guess. People that are too touchy make me uncomfortable, people that talk too loud around me, people initiating conversations with me without me knowing them. I hate idiots, people that can't think for themselves, loud people, smartasses, normies, arguing for the sake of arguing, in fact I avoid arguments whenever I can. Well, I hate them simply because I cannot get along with them easily, most of my friends are people that understand me quite easily and I tend to filter people based on that.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nBeing able to say whatever I want without having to censor myself, having fun, talking about my interests, doing my hobbies, learning new stuff, etc.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nAnxiety, low self esteem, impostor syndrome. Sometimes I have no motivation to brush my teeth or I tend to oversleep / not sleep enough. I also become anxious about the future, I get thoughts, what if I get fired, what if then this that and I spiral but not for long periods of time, but it happens. I have frequent mood swings and normally I just got the bitch resting face.\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI don't really daydream much but when I do I don't pay attention to my surroundings and I just go \"uh?\" or \"sorry i spaced out\", I am not aware of my surroundings and even with simple tasks like taking out the trash I would keep going straight while I'm thinking and would have to remind myself that the garbage bin I skipped while I'm moving and I appear like an idiot.\n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI would look for a way to escape because I'm not staying in an empty room for more than an hour or so, I would get claustrophobic eventually and would instinctively attempt to break out on my own. Having no one to talk to or nothing to do is one the things I hate.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI consider all the possibilities of that option that I choose. It works kind of like the butterfly effect, like if I take option A1 it could lead to B1 then C1 then D1 and if I take option A2 it could lead to B1 C2 and something like that, I try to look for that option that correlates with what I want to achieve and more often than not I roll with it even though I'm never 100% sure about it. I do change my mind a lot since I might find a better option than the former later on.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI don't really understand my emotions and usually I feel like a robot because I don't get strong feelings at all. The emotional stances are like laughter, crying and the usual blank face. I find my emotions annoying and tend to ignore them and bottle them up whenever I can, until they explode on me.\n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNo, I don't see why I should agree with someone just to make them feel better. If I am 99% sure I am right about something and I've thought it in my head I wouldn't mind escalating it into a debate to see their POV, because there be a 1% chance that I could be wrong. I look for logical inconsistencies in people's points and arguments and I am quick to point them out, then they get upset. \n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't break rules often solely because I want to have a peaceful life, in fact being in jail is one of the things that I fear and I hope never happens to me. I would say authority as a whole is complex topic to talk about because society as we have it, can never be perfect no matter what the circumstances are. People will always abuse their power and there's always going to be people to break rules, and that's probably why life is fun in that sense, if everyone abided by the rules and people didn't abuse their power, the world would be dull.

{"submission": "How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m an 18 year old girl. I have split dyed hair, and tend to dress in either a feminine alternative/emo style OR like a little boy(graphic t shirts and basketball shorts i take from my brother)\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI\u2019m autistic. I grew up undiagnosed(as a lot of people do) and it definitely shaped my childhood and psychological makeup as a whole. Related- I have also struggled with an eating disorder and self harm, but I see those as symptoms of the bigger issue rather than the cause. \n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI grew up in a fairly normal family, with a twin brother. He had some difficulties in childhood, ironically he was diagnosed with autism a lot earlier than I was and he was mostly nonverbal and showed developmental delays. In comparison, I was labeled \u201cgifted\u201d and performed well academically, which I think contributed to my not getting diagnosed. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI do not have a job currently but my DREAM is to work at a game company, as a 3D modeler or a concept artist. Preferably with characters, I find backgrounds/props a little boring. \n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nThat is the ideal weekend for me!! I love to spend time on my own :) I rarely get lonely unless I\u2019m already feeling down and the solitude stops being comforting.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI love to draw, write, read, play video games, watch my favorite shows(mostly cartoons), listen to music, and exercise! I\u2019ve been getting into running lately, and I have a black belt in taekwondo. I don\u2019t like team sports very much and never did them as a kid.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI have a TON of ideas. I often find myself wishing for more hours in the day and more mental energy to sustain it because I just have a lot of things I\u2019d like to do, all the time. I have multiple \u201cuniverses\u201d with stories in my head, as well as unnamed or unhoused characters that need development. I always have a catalogue of things I\u2019d like to create running in the back of my mind. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI think I\u2019d be good at it but I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. I grew into being really proficient at reading people and analyzing group dynamics, as well as \u201cplaying\u201d certain archetypes. I think I would be able to lead a group and adapt to the person they needed me in order to be the most productive/effective but I would find it exhausting.\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nPhysically? I think I\u2019m average- I\u2019ve definitely had some blunders but I\u2019m not extraordinarily clumsy.

{"submission": "**Enneagram:** Considered type 4 and 6. \n\n**Instinctual Variant:** SP/SX\n\n**My Main Focus in Life is Self-Expression:** \n\nDecorating my environment to suit a specific aesthetic including what I wear. \n\nI find joy in customization, defining and communicating my identity. \n\nIt can be a way of saying, \u201cThis is who I am\u201d or \u201cThis is what I value\u201d. \n\nSelf-expression can boost my self confidence, feeling good in what I\u2019m wearing or how I\u2019ve decorated my space. It\u2019s a source of comfort.\n\nSometimes, my emotions and feelings can be challenging to express verbally. Fashion and decor can become a non-verbal means of conveying my emotions or moods.\n\nFor me, the act of creating or customizing items can have therapeutic benefits. It can be a way to relax, relieve stress, and focus on something positive and enjoyable.\n\nI appreciate the beauty in different materials, colors, and designs, which can bring joy and satisfaction.\n\n**Core Desires:** \n\nTo be cherished, having support, empathy and guidance.  \n(Secondarily, validation, fulfillment, self-expression, mastery and self-development). \n\n**Core Fears:**\n\nBeing disliked, hated, outcasted and judged (negative perception).  \n\nBeing helpless, without support, guidance, inadequacy and rejection (Isolation and vulnerability).\n\n**Stance:** \n\nI want to do things well, I depend on others for feedback, my orientation is on the present and concerned with \"what needs to be done now\". Anxious of what is coming up in the near future and wants it over with.\n\n**Response:**\n\nFear, confusion, anxiety, and concern with protection. \n\nAnxiety and safety is a huge thing for me, I'm typically anxious by default. I will prep for disasters.\n\nQuick in anger and panic, move to action.\n\nI do not feel that I can defend myself through words adequately and end up having a bad mental episode.\n\n**Skills:**\n\nI am quite artistic but generally not creative in coming up with ideas or solutions. I do better with using past experiences to tackle problems. Funny enough my skill in problem-solving comes down to needing a vast amount of experience to feed into my storage of knowledge to work with factors to solve \"creatively\". I rely on google a lot and ask others for help when tackling unique situations.\n\nWithout having a vast amount of skills in anything I can feel completely worthless and depressed. My happiness banks on my ability to learn new skills and improvement. \n\nThis can be anything like becoming a master in anything artful such as drawing, sewing, sculpting, music, etc. This can be learning a new language or advancing in the chosen language. This could be mastering physics and expanding knowledge in scientific fields. Etc. Not to be confused with failing at success, I don't need to be successful. I feel fulfilled simply by having a skill(s). It brings peace and confidence within me. Competency provides confidence and something to share passionately.  \n\n**Communicating with Others:**\n\nI'm a soft-spoken individual who can be described as socially shy, sensitive, reserved and introverted. When giving my opinion on something to someone my foremost thoughts are usually subjective \u201cDo I like it?\u201d etc. Although\u2026I like to answer quite objectively, honestly and with constructive criticism. While criticism is tough, I value honesty.\n\nIt's kind of awkward for me when I'm around people who are really emotional, and I'm not always sure what to say to make things better.\n\nI tend to concentrate on my own concerns, and sometimes my lack of interest in others can make me feel like I might come across as self-centered. \n\nI seek security and comfort in my connections with others and tend to be anxious about personal safety and safety of those close to me.\n\nI also struggle with lying and instead if I\u2019m asked something I don't feel comfortable giving a straight (negative or personal) response to... I will stay quiet and cannot bring myself to speak, it's like I lost the ability to speak.\n\nWhen it comes to leadership roles, I don't find them appealing; they feel restrictive and confining.\n\n**Focus:**\n\nI am typically present-focused. I just don't like to think about the past and or future. Present entertainment and pleasures are what I indulge in.\n\nI am the type to stress about upcoming events until it passes. If there is a deadline then until I complete the thing I will be in a stressed state. I'm also someone who prefers play over work. I struggle to focus and have a hard time tackling tasks but I try to do tasks in intervals. I will work out how many pages of a book per day I have to read to reach a deadline for example but some days I don't feel up to it so ill recalculate and simply adjust the general plan to reach my goal in time.\n\n**Other:**  \nI favor familiarity, change is best when it's my choice. I\u2019m prone to depression, glass is half-empty. I\u2019m open to new experiences aligned with my interests. I value freedom. I prioritize both expressing myself authentically, achieving competence in my endeavors and a need for stability in my life.

{"submission": "I think I'm most probably INTJ. Every test I've taken has said INTJ or sometimes INFP or INTP, but I'm still not sure. I've also considered that I could be ENFP, ENTP or even INFJ. Can you guys help me please?\n\n\u2022\t**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\n23, Male, grew up in South Africa, living in Australia. I am a bright, optimistic, and cheerful person. I'm addicted to learning, I have a good sense of humour and love laughing. I love nature, bright colours, and anything that's unusual or out-of-the-box. Despite that, I also love dark and intense music, art, and literature. I adore classical music, especially Gustav Mahler, he's my absolute favourite, and I've recently been getting into progressive metal. I play numerous instruments, but the Violin is my favourite.  \nI love dark, tragic stories that explore deep concepts. My favourite book/movie is The Plague Dogs. I also love Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Quintin Tarantino (love/hate), and Hayao Miyazaki. Mononoke Hime is also one of my favourite movies.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI have ADHD-PI. \n\n\u2022\t**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nI was homeschooled from the age of 7. My mom (ENFJ) is very spiritual, but not religious. She loves Law of Attraction sort of stuff, which I don't believe in. This occasionally causes a bit of conflict between us. I'm not religious at all.  \nMy father (ISFP) was physically abusive to me and would constantly fight with my mom. They divorced when was 10. My life was very free after that, no school, no fucked-up father, I loved it. I was free to create and be myself.\n\n\u2022\t**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI dream of this all the time. It would be fantastic!\n\n\u2022 \t**What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good  at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI'm not a fan of sports. I love walking and being out in nature. Walking helps me think and stay connected to myself. I don't really do any other physical activities\n\n\u2022 \t**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What  are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am extremely curious about the natural world. Particularly botany and meteorology. I'm also obsessed by the etymology of words. I love linguistics and learning new languages.  \nI also love philosophy and like to explore and understand many different worldviews  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I hate telling others what to do. And at the same time, I hate being part of a team and I can't stand it when people tell me what to do. I'm very independent.\n\n\u2022 \t**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you  enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI enjoy working with my hands, and I'm quite good at it. However I am extremely clumsy and unaware of the world around me,\n\n\u2022 \t**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular  artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of  art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI'm extremely artistic. I paint and write music, and play numerous instruments. Art is how I connect to my inner soul. My paintings and music are highly symbolic and generally represent philosophical concepts that concern me at that time. I use art to bring these concepts to life in a physical medium which I feel allows me to understand them better.\n\n\u2022\t**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past is history, the future's a mystery, and the present is a gift. That being said, I struggle to live in the now, and tend to worry about the future quite a lot. I kind of live in a 'psuedo-now' state, where I'm living in the present, but in my head, and I'm aware of my thoughts as if they were physical objects. Almost everything I do is done in order to make a future plan happen. I never really think about the past. I actually have a terrible long and short term memory, so the past is a place I can never really visit, even if I wanted to.\n\n\u2022 \t**How do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI'd feel a bit annoyed, and would rather they didn't ask me. If I were to help them, I would try to get their problem solved as quickly as possible so that I can get back to my own life. I would also try to solve their problem thoroughly and carefully so that it won't happen again.\n\n\u2022\t**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI only do things that make sense. If it doesn't make sense, or is illogical, I struggle to get it done.\n\n\u2022\t**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI try to do everything as quickly, smoothly, and efficiently as possible. My Grandmother (ISFJ) loves all gimmicky gadgets often gets angry when I don't use them. I can't stand it. I hate anything impractical.\n\n\u2022\t**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI have often been accused of being manipulative. I genuinely don't do it on purpose, I just tend to come across that way. I sometimes try and persuade people to do things that will benefit me (and them too, I'm not evil) by showing them evidence that it will help them.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nLike I said before, I love music, art poetry, linguistics, climatology, botany, and philosophy. I see them more as tools to help me understand the world around me.\n\n\u2022 \t**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you  struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?**\n\nLogic and creativity. I'm not good at memorizing things, and I'm not in tune with my senses.\n\n\u2022\t**How good  are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable  tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you  go?**\n\nI try and construct a plan and stick to it, but I often end by improvising as I go along, because there was something that I didn't take into account.\n\n\u2022\t**What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nNone. I don't aspire for anything. I have no real world goals. I only want to understand myself, create art, and appreciate the natural world. That's it.\n\n\u2022\t**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI'm afraid of not doing the right thing. Whether it's writing an excel spreadsheet, or making important decisions. I'm terrified that I might do the wrong thing and regret it and mess things up forever.\n\n\u2022\t**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nProductive, creative, maybe a little bit impulsive, SOOO many ideas. This is when I usually start/finish all my projects.\n\n\u2022\t**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nNumb, depressed, apathetic. I struggle to get things done. I can stare out of the window for hours and think about life.\n\n\u2022 \t**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of  your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI'm permanently daydreaming. I can't control myself, and it actually has a negatively affect on my life.  \nI'm almost never aware of what's going on around me. I frequently knock things over, bump into things, misplace things, and make silly mistakes here and there.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI'm not too sure. My thoughts are random and usually not based on my surroundings. Sometimes I might see something that reminds me of something else, and then uncontrollably I zone out into a daydream state. \n\n\u2022\t**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI struggle to make decisions. As I mentioned before, I have a fear of doing the wrong thing, so it takes me a long to to decide what I should do.   \nI almost always change my mind once I've made a decision.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI'm quite good with my emotions. They are complex and colourful, I love experiencing them. My emotions are very personal to me, I don't like to show them to anyone, and certainly don't make them anyone else's problem.  \nWhen I feel them, I analyze them and try to work out their meanings. I perceive my emotions like [this](https://youtu.be/8iWmzp7EPPw?si=kDdEr4ptWHpCi1wh&t=55). However, I do have the ability to put my emotions on hold. Let's say that I'm currently feeling sad, and there is something I need to do, I just stop being sad for a moment, do thing, and then go back to being sad again. I try to never let my emotions influence my actions, but sometimes I get a bit carried away, and may raise my voice and say/do something stupid that I end up regretting later.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI do this frequently. I don't want to start any drama, so I just pretend to agree with them, even when I don't share their views. However there are a few people (close friends) that I'm not afraid to disagree with. I actually love debating.\n\n\u2022\t**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI have my own set of rules that I seldom break. I don't care about anyone else's rules, and I don't expect anyone to care about mine. I do my own thing, in my own way.   \nI would never do anything to harm someone, but I see nothing wrong with breaking a rule that doesn't make any sense. No one knows what's best for anyone but themselves, so no one has the authority to tell anyone else what to do or how they should live.  \nYes, authority should be challenged as often as possible. I see no one as superior or inferior. No Gods, No Masters is my motto.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks guys.  \n", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.6146361}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -1.4082878}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.0923755}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.5308254}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.423489}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.729872}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -6.738528}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.815903}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.831139}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -6.8910375}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.1918874}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.4567113}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -8.318234}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -8.334001}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -8.348741}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.390027}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -8.808307}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -8.971093}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -8.995627}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -9.044559}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0057059815}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -5.3387003}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -7.3873663}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.144965}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -9.66492}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -11.038623}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.233174}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -11.313443}, {"token": "t", "logprob": -11.558425}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.714904}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -12.073852}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.520751}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -12.594323}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -12.957318}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.074874}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.165877}, {"token": "fp", "logprob": -13.349715}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.459439}, {"token": "SP", "logprob": -13.903087}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -13.905779}]}}

{"submission": "# Introduction\n\nWhen I look at ESTJ characters I can't help but worry that I might be mistyped. I'm not all that bossy, I don't care about micromanaging others and I am certainly not a workaholic. On the surface I seem to appear like a lot of ENTJ characters along with a lot of ENTPs mixed in there *(I am 97% sure I don't have Ni-Se though.)* I have a relatively weak sense of self which makes it difficult to evaluate on an objective level. To add to the confusion I suffer from ADHD and went unmedicated for my entire life until recently which was definitely what made me believe I was ENTP before. My close friends and confidants disagree between ESTJ and ENTP, so I know it's not just me. So to sum up, the main issue is that I seem very ENTP at times, but I believe my Si is too strong to be inferior, in fact I would consider it one of my strongest functions. I'm unsure whether I use Ti or Te, I'm heavily leaning on Te though. So if you've got time, read through the bullet points below, ask me some questions if you'd like and let me know what you think.\n\n# Bullet points\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  I enjoy daydreaming while walking or falling asleep, I will seldom let myself do it if there's something I should rather be doing it. So it's often kept to walks and as a way of falling asleep.  \n\n*  I wouldn't consider myself widely innovative or original, often \"my ideas\" are just my own spin on something I've seen before. My projects often end up being HEAVILY inspired by what I've enjoyed before. I enjoy writing stories in private, a lot of my ideas and plot points are taken from fiction I've enjoyed myself with a few added elements to make sure it's not a copy-paste. In short, they essentially end up being kind of predictable and generic plot-wise, but with good characters and good dialogue to make up for it.  \n\n*  If something isn't going to be reliable long-term, I will attempt to make it reliable, if I can't I'll feel compelled to find something else.  \n\n*  I don't crave novelty and I don't really crave any form of excitement, I'm the happiest at home working on my own projects and improving on them. When I do go out in my free time it'll be to maintain friendships and not out of any desire to have fun.  \n\n*  On the subject of friendships, I have few people I consider close friends. I am bad at keeping friendships due to me having no inherent desire to spend time with people that aren't my girlfriend. This doesn't mean I don't value friends, I'm loyal to the core and will always be available if one of them needs help. I am just bad at setting time aside to have fun with them  \n\n*  I am often frustrated with interruptions to my leisure time, I often consider leisure time to be sacred. I often spend it with my girlfriend, but if it's not with her, I will mostly be alone. If something comes up while I'm relaxing I will get cranky.  \n\n*  I am quite opinionated politically, I don't go looking for debates, but I will assert my opinion if I disagree with someone. My political views are often very grounded, and I will often reject views I see as heavily idealistic or realistically impractical to implement.  \n\n* I have ADHD, which obviously makes me distractable, excitable and scattered. Taking meds makes me a lot less so, I had difficulty studying beforehand, I had a strong desire to since I hated the feeling of being behind, it made me feel incredibly insecure and made me doubt my own intellect. Since I started my meds I find studying easier and a lot less tedious. I've made it a habit to study at least an hour everyday. I usually meet that hour, but rarely go over it.  \n\n*  My room is often messy, I usually peg this on ADHD though I am still often a bit ashamed to admit it. I will often have a cluttered desk and clothes spread around the floor for easy access when I wake up. This goes on for a few weeks till I feel claustrophobic and disgusted by the mess and spend an hour or so cleaning.  \n\n*  In school (college and trade school as an electrician) I would dislike doing things without knowing precisely what I was doing was correct or incorrect. Often I'd be the annoying one who'd go up to the teacher and go \"Just so I'm fully certain, I am supposed to do x, then y using z?\" if I was unsure and the teacher wasn't available I'd often get stuck and wait for the teacher. Essentially, I dislike starting on something without being fully certain if I'm wasting my time or not  \n\n*  I don't know how relevant this is, but I often use the words \"In my experience\"  \n\n*  I enjoy the process of researching a topic, usually it'll be something related to what I'm doing. But occasionally I'll ask myself \"How intelligent are birds?\" and look it up, I don't bounce from topic to topic like some people though, I often keep it to just that.  \n\n*  I don't consider myself a workaholic, in fact I consider myself to be quite lazy. At school and at work, I shoot for precisely the amount of work that's expected, what you ask for is what you get, no more, no less. This is one of the primary reasons I'm uncertain whether or not I'm ESTJ. I enjoy improving things, but on my own terms, I don't feel a compulsive need to go above and beyond, unless I am personally interested. I seek to improve and maximize the effectiveness of my hobbies, learning to write better, and playing more optimally (videogames), I don't necessarily think about \"How can I make this process more enjoyable\", if what I'm doing makes me better I'll likely enjoy it more.  \n\n*  I don't take things too seriously compared to the average ESTJ. I will often laugh off mistakes unless something was properly fucked up. but on the other hand, I am definitely more serious than an average ENTP  \n\n*  I can often see the validity of other people's viewpoints even if I disagree. For example socialism vs capitalism. I can see why a socialist would prefer socialism as well as the benefits of socialism on paper, but to me, it has proven to be unreliable and impractical.  \n\n*  I am at times up in my head and slightly absent-minded.  \n\n*  I will often do things the same way over and over, unless a better method shows up, though I'll often reject it in the start. In a way I am quite contrarian, if I have my way of doing it or looking at it I will stubbornly stick to it. Whenever I do change up my methods it's usually a result of someone pointing out to me how it's way better, in a way makes it make sense for me. For example, my phone didn't have a plug thingy for earbuds, so if I wanted to listen to music in cars or in public, I'd put the volume all the way down and take the phone up to my ear. One day my mom got sick of it and gave me her AirPods, this was years after they became popular. Only after using them then did I change.  \n\n*  I am open to new ways of doing things if it's not forced on me. We're working together and you wanna take a creative new approach to your part? Go for it, if it works I don't care in the slightest how you get it done, as long as it is done.  \n\n*  I struggle with deadlines, often having trouble meeting them, ADHD might come into play. I will often have full intention to do it when I say \"I'll do it later\" but I'll end up forgetting. It's not necessarily a procrastination tactic but more like me not having the means to do it in the moment and forgetting to do it when I have the means to do it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI might make this in video form at a later date if I don't reach full certainty, I believe it could be easier get more insight through body language. Most of my \"ENTPness\" seems to sit in my tone and body language. Anywho, please ask away if you've got any questions. I will be very grateful to anyone who takes the time to lend me a hand.\n\n ", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": "ENTP", "logprobs": {"ENT": [{"token": "ENT", "logprob": -1.1307056}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -1.2717903}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -1.8502872}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.4130428}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -3.2082698}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -3.4585407}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -3.60439}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -4.659234}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -4.851365}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -5.132596}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.2552176}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -5.573926}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -5.879136}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -5.9056063}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -5.9492807}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -6.3893194}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.646966}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -6.814103}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -7.0307055}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -7.1961813}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.09179423}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -2.4341614}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.965489}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.216727}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -13.537772}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -14.794465}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -14.830951}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.880809}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -15.257485}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.406892}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -15.429696}, {"token": "PJ", "logprob": -15.674357}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -15.764104}, {"token": "R", "logprob": -16.069324}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -16.172369}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -16.177326}, {"token": "PS", "logprob": -16.287504}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -16.357718}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -16.414644}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -16.428045}]}}
{"submission": " \n\n* **Give us a general description of yourself.**  \n\\- Male. I like games, playing some sports, a bit of anime. I like reading aswell although i haven't done it in awhile but i want to again soon. \n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**  \n\\- I have OCD for a few years now. Still struggling but it is what it is. \n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**  \n\\- It was sort of tough but also not brutally bad. It was tough because of family just being assholes and secretly doing sketchy stuff to eachother. So i had times where it was cool, but some times were a bit icky. But all around, i can't complain. It def had a religious upbringing, but i wouldn't say it was done well to be honest. I am still religious tho.   \n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**  \n\\- It depends on the week i had and my mood, sometimes i would like it. Other times tho, i may want to hang out with others so its 50/50.  \n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**  \n\\- As i mentioned, i do like some sports. But i am mostly just staying at home.  \n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**  \n\\- Quite curious, even about little/trivial things. Some random thing may pop up and i will search it up because i want to know. But not only randomly curious, i just like to know things, learn. I also like to be sure by knowing more or as much as possible.   \n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**  \n\\- Depends, i can be a good leader, but not in ALL things. And i may not take the position right from the start. I may do it if i am confident, or when i need to (otherwise others will fuck it up).   \n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**  \n\\- Nah, to be honest i am clumsy as fuck. I am aware of my surroundings, but not \"fully\"? When i am seriously observing my surroundings, i am not clumsy. But when i am just doing basic things, i forget that i left the door handle above my head open so i chuck my head to it for example, stuff like that. I am focused on something and because of that, i forget about the other because i am so busy in my head.   \n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**  \n\\- I like some paintings, but i am NOT artisctic at all myself. I can appreciate nice paintings tho (mostly some landscape or sky).  \n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**  \n\\- All 3 affect me, but present the least i think? past (nostalgia, cringey memories etc.) present (?) future (possibilities, thinking ahead, anxiety, big picture etc.)  \n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**  \n\\- 99% i don't mind and help so, cause why not? But if you are a bitch to me or something and you ask for help, i may or may not help you. But i will be annoyed if you abuse asking for help or when i need to do something myself aswell and you keep asking.   \n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**  \n\\- Yes  \n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**  \n\\- Pretty important  \n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**  \n\\- I may do it with a few family members, but not in a negative way (try to guide them into not doing stupid shit and stuff). Because i don't want them to not know what to do or letting them do stupid stuff when i could have told them earlier aswell.   \n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**  \n\\- Already mentioned it. Sports, because its fun and healthy (nice physcial activity). Gaming is fun aswell (more mental) and Anime and reading are just entertainment. Books may be non-fiction aswell about things i could learn so there's that.   \n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**  \n\\- It needs to be clear. Don't be vague, be clear and just explain. Don't overtalk and yap, and not too short either. Just medium. I want learn by theory and practice. Theory is not needed 100%, but it will help ALOT since i feel more confident because i feel more prepared. Also logic is a huge factor, if its not logical, it won't get through and it will be gone in 5 minutes. And i like having the ability to ask for help if i need it.   \n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**  \n\\- I can be decent at it. I don't really only improvise and go, since you will forget stuff and then mess up, all that shit.   \n\n* **What's important to you and why?**  \n\\- Being successful. That's my life goal and that is what i want to do. Make some family members proud aswell.   \n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**  \n\\- Bugs, Heights, OCD thoughts. Speaks for itself.   \n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**  \n\\- Things going well, being in a good mood and just generally things being positive.   \n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**  \n\\- Bad mood, things are not going well, etc etc.   \n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**  \n\\- Depends, 50/50. I can be a heavy daydreamer, but i can also pay attention. If i daydream, i mostly am aware of my surroundings. But if i am REALLY dreaming, which i sometimes do, i am lost for a quick moment.   \n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**  \n\\- Thinking why the fuck i am in that room and how to get out or what i can do.   \n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**  \n\\- Depends on what the decision is for, sometimes i can be easy, sometimes not. And i can change my mind pretty often.   \n\n* **How important are emotions in your life?**  \n\\- \"important\"? don't know. but i do have to do alot with them tho. i am a bit of an emotional person.   \n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**  \n\\- Sometimes, maybe if i want to stretch time or other reasons.   \n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**  \n\\- Sometimes, if the rules are stupid and hindering then i can give 0 fucks. If authority acts like they're everything, go fuck yourself. Other than that, i will be respectful at default. If the authority is nice and chill, then all is good. \n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**  \n\\- Being successfull, being stable, things are going well etc. ", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": "ISTJ", "logprobs": {"IST": [{"token": "IST", "logprob": -0.28925115}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -2.2737424}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -2.3557584}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -3.9204252}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -4.5756397}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -4.927622}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -5.390051}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -5.440239}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -6.3708153}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -6.847603}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -6.856699}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.0169697}, {"token": " ES", "logprob": -7.508747}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.946064}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.322237}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -8.587555}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -8.868317}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -8.974564}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.281687}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -9.347616}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.0040735323}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -5.5066485}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.311938}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.454164}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -13.940072}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -15.111423}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -15.175542}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.368173}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -16.099041}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -16.646227}, {"token": "K", "logprob": -17.041885}, {"token": "JS", "logprob": -17.059345}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -17.070854}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -17.16581}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -17.256538}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -17.298328}, {"token": "E", "logprob": -17.361938}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -17.43697}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -17.461441}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -17.654877}]}}
{"submission": "I've been into typology for a while, but I'm still not really sure about my MBTI. I've had some options, but now I'm completely unsure. Can you help me please? \n\nThis is a description of me:\n\n-I'm quite ambiverted, I like people and to say my opinion out loud (sometimes), but I get drained quite easily. \n\n- I'm not the best at picking social cues, especially not when I was younger. I'm great at analyzing other people's personalities, but I'm pretty lost when it comes to interactions. \n\n- I'm very fair, even to a fault. I want everything to be fair, to a point it's unrealistic, but I can't help it. \n\n- I have great unbiased, rational thinking, but also strong emotions that tend to show up usually when something isn't the way I'm used to it or when I feel like I've failed, and then these emotions mess up everything. I can't control it too well at home. At school I'm better, but when I was young, it was also a disaster. My emotions usually show as anger. \n\n- I hate change. I can't put up with it. I don't even know why I hate it. \n\n- I want to plan everything, but I don't know how to plan. \n\n- I have a scattered imagination. I usually can't imagine anything, and then, suddenly, the most random interesting thing pops up in my mind. \n\n- I don't know how to deal with my own emotions, but my friends say I'm a good emotional support \n\n- Even though I'm pretty emotional at home, I seem fairly calm in public. \n\n- I'm judgemental and my own harshest critic. \n\n- I'm sometimes too responsible and overprotective\n\n- Overall, I'd say I have a tough-to-deal-with kinda  personality and not everyone can just talk with me. \n\n- I often compare myself with other people. \n\n- Moral compass matters to me. \n\n- I often show sympathy, but don't feel it. \n\n- I'd be a good leader if I were better with people. \n\n- I judge objectively. \n\n- I'm able to procrastinate without others noticing I procrastinate, and manage to get everything done. \n\n- I sometimes tend to sacrifice myself for the sake of others because it feels right. \n\n- I tend to bring rules even to places like parties, without noticing it. \n\n- Little children like me better than people my age. \n\n- Even though I don't like changes, I like the feeling of trying a new thing. \n\n- I'm afraid to talk about my interests because it would hurt to hear others judging the interest. \n\n- I like to encourage self conscious people. People like that usually become my friends for some reason. \n\n- I'm a perfectionist\n\nThat's probably all.

My interests include video games, reading, studying, and hanging out with friends. I notice in one on ones I excel socially but in groups I remain silent. I love helping people and want to see growth in human individuals. I resonate a lot in particularly with INFJ, ENFP, and ENTP but I struggle to decipher between those three. I feel I have a very analytical mind but my emotions toward navigating the social arena stifle me and prevent me from projecting my true, more blunt thoughts. I tend to procrastinate because I fear that my work will not be good enough due to perfectionist tendencies. I tend to jump from topic to topic in order to keep a conversation with others fresh. I therefore exhibit a lot of Ne and Ti while also being a highly emotional person. I find it difficult to deduce that I\u2019m a thinker given how often I prioritize feelings so I tend to lean toward ENFP but I feel I have little to no Fi. I fair decently socially, with many people saying that one of the best things about me is how I listen and care, which also dissuades me from believing I\u2019m an xNTP, but it\u2019s possible I have developed a stronger Fe given my type.

I LOVE rollercoasters and theme parks and going out on-a-whim every once in a while, but I think my limit of thrill-seeking may be lower compared to others due to my high sense of responsibility\n* keep to myself, very private, but friendly and smile a lot (I'm always up to make a new friend, unless I don't think my values align with yours. In that case, I'll probably avoid you completely)\n* start conversations with others by asking what they're working on, or how they've been, or what they've done over the weekend. I never start a convo by talking about myself or coming up with some crazy/funny out-of-pocket ideas like my brother (ENTP 7w8)\n* love working on creative projects for artistic expression. Though all my projects are derived from some sort of inspiration as I don't usually come up with art completely on my own\n* go with the flow in social groups.

{"submission": "So I\u2019ve been introduced by my friend to the typology sphere. And we\u2019re having an ongoing debate about whether I am an, intj, istj, or entj. I highly doubt istj though because I am pretty flexible and not really bent on rules. But we\u2019ll see \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. If there are typos, no there aren\u2019t. \n\nSome descriptions of myself, I\u2019ll try to stay completely objective. I\u2019ll also use the given prompt to help me out a bit. \n\n- For starters, I am a young adult living abroad for school. I am a pre med biological sciences major and minor in chemistry. My goal is to be become a radiologist hopefully by time I am 30. When you first meet me I am very quiet and will not speak unless spoken to. However if I like you enough and we became friends, I WILL talk your head off \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I can get witty and joke around a bit. I dress pretty alt/casual ig? I like comfortable clothes and pretty much wear black. Same with my shoes, I wear crocs strictly unless I am working. I\u2019d be a great marketer for crocs. They are my true love \ud83d\ude0d. \n\n- I work as a chef, but I hate it. It doesn\u2019t give me an intellectually stimulating environment. And I am surrounded by other chefs that do not know how to work productively. My options are thin though bc I live abroad. \n\n- I love debate. I take multiple classes surrounding it. \n\n- Am I not an authority type of person, I will always question whether or not they deserve to hold that title. I\u2019ll accept it if they have been proven to work well, if not I\u2019ll stay suspicious. I\u2019m just suspicious in general. \n\n- My mind runs on ten. I\u2019ll talk about something then get distracted talking about something else, then I\u2019ll go back to the main point. \n\n- Mutual respect is my middle name, why should I respect you, if you do not respect me? \n\n- Highly suspicious and I do not take other peoples words at face value. \n\n- Growing up I was a \u201cwhy\u201d kid. I ask a lot of questions still, my goal is to throughly understand. \n\n- When I\u2019m arguing I\u2019m the type of person to say \u201cit\u2019s the principle of the matter!\u201d \n\n- I love having alone time unbothered to let me do the things I wanna do. \n\n- I like many activities. I\u2019m pretty flexible with things I enjoy, I don\u2019t mind trying new things either. As long as it isn\u2019t too dangerous but even then, if there was a roller coaster that looked pretty unsafe\u2026 I may get on it. I am relatively good at sports, I love soccer and played it throughout my highschool years. However, I cannot do too many outdoor things or I\u2019ll be too drained. So to compensate by playing video games like, animal crossing, genshin, baldurs gate, and saints row. A good variety id say. \n\n- I am a self proclaimed master at strategizing. I even strategize the way I\u2019m going to shop. It\u2019s a habit of mine that I do the organize my thoughts and actions. I never improvise, yuck. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m sorry but I am one of those people that have to throughly plan vacations or I will not have fun \ud83d\ude2d. For example went to Disneyland with friends and I planned the routes we were going to go a week before. I can go with the flow sometimes though. If it\u2019s not important sure, but if I\u2019m trying to have maximum amount of enjoyment, I will plan accordingly. Even with projects. \n\n- It takes me FOREVER to make important decisions. I have to weigh out everything to make sure it is the best answer. And I wish wash bc I\u2019m adding more info that could either make it or break it. So I change my mind quite a lot. It frustrates other people but you don\u2019t understand if I do not think it through, I will be heavily unsatisfied. \n\n- Very future oriented. I love to plan my future out. I already have. I\u2019m just a big planner in general. A good plan that considers different possibilities is a nice one. \n\n- I\u2019m not really an emotional type of person, makes me uncomfortable. Only emotion I\u2019ll usually show is anger, that\u2019s it. \n\n- I\u2019m a matter of fact type of person. I\u2019ll give you a straight answer or if I can\u2019t it\u2019s because there are too many things to take into account. Just give me some time. \n\n- I\u2019m impatient so I love patient people. \n\n- I start things I never finish because I get bored easily, I do that with art and tv shows or movies. Never finish shows for the life of me. \n\n- Perfectionist, I hold myself to a HIGH standard. Getting anything less than an A is unacceptable. And to this day I go by that standard. \n\n- However I\u2019m very flexible and open to the opinions of others. That doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t challenge your opinion though. If it has been backed up well I\u2019ll accept it quickly and throw out my last opinion I held. \n\n- I am the least judgemental person you\u2019ll ever meet. Usually because I do not care what you do. I have my own stuff to worry about. If it makes you happy and doesn\u2019t hurt other people, do you boo. \n\n- I\u2019m the type of person when arguing to say \u201cshow me your stats?\u201d While I have mine on standby. \n\n- If I don\u2019t value the rules I\u2019ll break them. \n\n- I work systematically, with anything. I like things to be done efficiently. Like I\u2019m big on efficiency and it makes me mad if others aren\u2019t like that. With video games, communication anything I\u2019m like that. \n\n- Aspirations I have are to become a doctor, buy a house and have a child maybe. A child because idk, I would love to pass my knowledge down while loving someone greatly. And I like taking care of kids. I would adopt though, why add one more kid to the problem when there are already kids here. I always say if I were a billionaire I would adopt as many kids as I can to give them a fair chance at life. If they take it or not it\u2019s up to them, but at least they have a choice ya know. My personal aspirations are to gain more people in my life? Not too many but people I can interact with intellectually. I\u2019m studying overseas so it\u2019s hard to make friends here and frankly I\u2019m not interested because they wouldn\u2019t last in the long run. \n\n- I\u2019m pretty inconsistent myself and when it comes to solutions I have a hard time find one bc there are multiple possibilities and I\u2019m weighing out pros and cons. Does it work? It\u2019s it efficient? Can I throw this idea out?\n\n- I\u2019m often forgetful because I\u2019m in my head a lot. I\u2019ve lost some things that were right in front of me. And I hurt myself quite a bit. I\u2019m a chef so my arms and hands are quite raggedy. \n\n- I also love religion and always question why we let it reign over our lives. \n\nIf you have any questions, shoot.

{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\n23, male. Computer science major. Consider myself very calm, not very emotional on the outside. Love to solve puzzles. I'm looking to become a software engineer after I finish school. I enjoy playing video games, singing, and watching anime and reading manga. Not much else too me tbh.\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy family was Christian, but not super duper religious. I went to church when I was young but stopped going once I hit high school. Realized that religion just didn't interest me so I stopped pursuing it.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nAs mentioned above, I am a CS major and looking to become a software engineer in the near future. I overall enjoy my classes, but I wouldn't say it's ride or die. It's enough to open many doors for me and to allow myself to make a good living. That's about it.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI feel like if I had friends, I would wanna do something with them. Unless I'm staying home with an SO, I would much rather hang out with friends or dates. Yes, if I am really exhausted, I do need some time to rest and recharge but after that, I'm ready to have fun again.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nVideo games, anime & manga, singing. Played baseball, soccer, and basketball when I was a kid but fell out of it due to competition. I enjoy sports like dodgeball and stuff like that. But I'm not a very active person. I much rather get my exercise passively like riding my bike or walking to do daily activities like groceries, errands, etc.\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nNot very curious to be honest. I don't think about random ideas all the time. My ideas are related to what my future will look like and how I plan to make it a reality with hard work and determination.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to it, but it isn't something I actively seek. If it is a leadership position in something I know and am confident in doing, then I can do it well. I wouldn't be an asshole leader but calm and rational in telling others what to do in order to accomplish something. I wouldn't get a power trip.\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI would say I'm pretty coordinated. I've always been a kinesthetically aware individual on whichever activity I would be doing (sports, painting, fixing something, dancing, etc.) I find working with my hands to be somewhat fun, but not something that I go crazy over. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI thought I was, but I really am not that artistic. Only thing I might end up doing in the future is painting, but I don't think I have the drive to pursue that.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI have varying opinions on each notion of time.\n\nPast: Tend to have a very negative about it since that is when I was inferior compared to where I am now.\n\nPresent: Neutral. I focus on what I need to do now so that I can live the life I wanna live in the future.\n\nFuture: When not stressed, very positive. I have a lot of things to look forward to in the future and I tend to have a very optimistic look towards the future, when I am not stressed or freaking out over something.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIf my parents tell me to do something, I will always do it. But it's not in a sort of way where I'm happy to do it, rather I need to get it over with so I can go back to what I was doing before. I certainly don't mind helping people, but I sort of help others with a resistant willingness.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nNot really no. I just prefer to understand things and to have them make sense.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nEfficiency isn't as important as productivity. Being productive helps me stay on track and helps me to accomplish my goals and tasks.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nNo, I don't control others. I don't like to control others.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI like singing because I just like singing. It's a fun activity. Video games are also fun. Same with manga and anime. It's all just fun for me.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI never really learned best with boring lectures. I always learn best by practicing something or doing something over and over again until I get the hang of it. Like in my CS classes, a lot of what is taught sticks with me when I have a chance to practice the concepts that are being taught and understanding them on a deeper level.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI'm more of an improviser than a strategist when it comes to projects. But I find strategy to be very important too.\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI want to move to Scotland and live my life there after I finish undergrad. I want to settle down and get married, but I don't want kids. I just want to live a normal life over there.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nIn terms of phobias, spiders. Hate those fuckers.\n\nIn terms of actual fears: having my efforts go in vain, failure, gloomy future when nothing is working, being alone (romantically and socially), not living the life I wanna live\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nWhen I am on top of my game and I am paving through life with goals in mind and making those dreams a reality.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nWhen it feels like I have no future and there's no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI sometimes daydream, but only if I am really bored. Otherwise, I am pretty grounded. When I do daydream, I am still somewhat paying attention to my surroundings so I've certainly never ran into any light posts or anything.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nMy future plans and future scenarios about those plans. I'll also daydream about falling in love with the love of my life.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt can take some time to really hone in on a decision, especially when I've looked at the pros and cons of something and really analyzed the best path forward, but once I hone in on something I almost never change course.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI think emotions are important, but sometimes you need to set the aside to get a job down. I tend to stay away from negative emotions and only try to think positively. Whenever I am grieving, I will never cry at the funeral, but tears will fall down silently when I am in bed late at night the same day. I am ***VERY*** private with my emotions. The only person I will ever emotionally confide into would be my SO or like my best friend or brother (not even my parents I will show my emotional side to them; too embarassing). \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI don't agree just to appease them, but I never rock the boat because I don't need that kind of heat on me. I don't mind silence if I have nothing else to say.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI never break the rules. Authority should only be challenged if they are being objectively wrong or unreasonable. Otherwise, I don't mind following rules if it makes sense.\n\n ", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": "ISTJ", "logprobs": {"IST": [{"token": "IST", "logprob": -0.32132655}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.8135865}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -2.9918969}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -3.1255314}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -4.7985663}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -6.2394996}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -6.441774}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -6.5314612}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.6105666}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -6.902612}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -7.103208}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -8.526944}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -8.748544}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -8.8572}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -9.093953}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.6034}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.701116}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.898786}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -9.991641}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -10.193524}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.31324634}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -1.3135306}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -10.305137}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.126597}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -12.644071}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.314874}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -13.463597}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -13.690864}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -13.884339}, {"token": "K", "logprob": -14.443557}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -14.852784}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -15.0653925}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -15.178294}, {"token": "Y", "logprob": -15.205364}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -15.289569}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -15.444001}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -15.5744705}, {"token": "M", "logprob": -15.595809}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -15.797534}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -15.806835}]}}

This suggests that setting boundaries and building assertiveness skills could be areas for growth.\n\nTo feel loved, you mentioned the importance of having your ideas respected and seen for their depth. This indicates that you value being understood and appreciated on an intellectual level, rather than just being judged based on your competence.\n\nOverall, your personality exhibits a combination of intellectual curiosity, a desire for deep connections, and a longing for recognition.

{"submission": "Hey guys! I think im an INFJ or INFP 4w3 sp/so or so/sp 496 but im not compeletly sure, so some help would be appreciated! I understand that the enneagram is about a person\u2019s childhood struggles and thus it exposes the ugliest part of an individual, so im gonna try to be as transparent about negative traits as possible!\n\nTw: mentions of ED!!\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been really into typology these past few years, but nothing snatched my interest like the enneagram has so far. I\u2019ve been reading articles and books on the enneagram for years and I\u2019ve just established this habit of subconsciously typing people around me 24/7. \u201cOh, {insert name} is taking 3 hours to get ready? That is so sx3 of them\u201d \u201cDid {insert name} just say that they would rather follow the rules to stay safe? I knew they were a so6\u201d just a little preview of how my inner monologue works at most times.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a quite observant kid, except as a kid I used to imagine myself in a show and then assign random people random roles that they fulfill in the play of my life. This has always been my style of thinking I guess, being the youngest in a family of 6, I was too young to relate to any of my older siblings so although I was babied and pampered most of the time (which I loved btw which I carve validation) at the end of the day, everyone would just go back to their lives as I just sat their in the sideline looking at everything and applying it to my head, daydreaming quietly.\nIn fact, in retrospect, I noticed that I usually loved being quiet and \u201cobedient\u201d because I noticed that I got praised for it a whole lot and so I saw being quiet and reserved rewarding in a way, cause even if I did not perform in school as my other siblings/peers or failed to achieve a huge achievement like winning first place in a competition or being healthy and in good shape, I can at least take pride in the fact that I was an \u201ceasy\u201d child. I was usually too busy with my thoughts anyway, analyzing and assigning my surroundings with parts, essentially, I envisioned this mental play of mine to be my future in a sense. I had a very specific image of my adult self, being special, unique, outstanding, and getting praised for it! But not too special that I provoke violence or resentment towards myself, just slight envy, as I still deep down really valued validation and admiration, to my core. I also felt deep envy for people for being able to live out a certain aspect of my dreams, such as celebrities, peers, distant relatives, etc. however being surrounded by 7 adults (my family) at all times was beyond exhausting, I was constantly told what to pursue, what to be, how to behave, etc. by all of my siblings and parents, it became quite contradictory and confusing as they all had differing high expectations from me to the point where I never really got to fully appease everybody which eventually led to me being burnt out and pretty much being a disappointment to everybody. Which led to feelings of intense shame that were converted into growing quite distant and becoming extremely volatile as a young teen.\n\nRight now as an adult, I still have the same exact dynamic with my family and with my dreams except im quite literally pushed to the side at all times as my family kind of gave up all of their hopes for me and are too busy with their own lives, most of my siblings have established new small families of their own and with everyone being able to relate to their adult struggles (marriage, children, work) I\u2019m quite literally constantly pushed to the side except for when I have a big decision to make then suddenly everyone\u2019s involved in my life all over again, and so I just started remaining numb rather than reacting or speaking up. \n\nAs for my social life, I\u2019m introverted and aloof although I fantasize about romance, belonging, having a well-established life where I can feel openly expressive, but still make people envy me (I feel guilty just admitting this but it\u2019s true) and once I get close to someone I become more expressive, and chatty, and complacent, and open, I also just love to help people in general, again being of great help helps make me feel validated. Also I tend to me more confident when around groups of friends. I long for an idealistic social status where I have friends and a partner that I can romanticize. \n\nLastly, I find comfort in sorrow, as much as I hate admitting it, it makes me feel entitled. I love suffering in silence and then have people find it out and make them pity me silently as  I tell them \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to worry about\u201d or something more aggressive/defensive like \u201cshut up, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me\u201d. Suffering in silence followed by a quiet realization made me feel validated and worthy of love. Especially since I lack many skills and I feel like im less than everyone else, I feel like being someone that ppl could praise out of pity kind of brought me some form of comfort. i mean smth that I did in high school that I hate admitting is that I went through an ED and I would kind of quietly flaunt the fact that I am not eating, and having people voice their concerns followed by me going \u201cno im good trust me\u201d made me feel worthwhile, like I\u2019m not so bad after all. Also I constantly compare myself to others and I get obsessive with validation/attention from people that I form an interest in to the point where I start neglecting my own wellbeing and try to appease/attract them as much as possible.\n\nThrough all of this though, I usually have a semi-easygoing/sunny demeanor, like im just chilling.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just need someone help type me :)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.15352617}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.1187418}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.8793087}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -5.012066}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.6947308}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.81979}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.0088043}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.806223}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.8127365}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.914278}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -8.050739}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -8.587265}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -9.2533455}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -9.314007}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -10.404825}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -10.425821}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -10.494303}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -10.496323}, {"token": "Type", "logprob": -10.560379}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.618479}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.00037788402}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -8.352987}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.535114}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.290115}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.605402}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -11.789984}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -12.127813}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.2787285}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.3396015}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.525686}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.454081}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -14.480562}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -14.531488}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.547863}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -15.0770035}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -15.326715}, {"token": "FF", "logprob": -15.485052}, {"token": "XS", "logprob": -15.50523}, {"token": "fp", "logprob": -15.724241}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -16.011412}]}}
{"submission": "Something that has always brought me to tears is rebellion. Rebellion for a cause. Although not for a true cause in the stereotypical sense of the word, rebellion for one's own heart; is an experience of one's own self in the world. A man growing angry at their old age: their bones are more frail, muscles are not what they used to be and now they struggle to do what they used to enjoy. The agonising yet alluring idea that we were thrust into this world against our own will: we gazed into a well, not full of water, but full of abyss. And chance stood beside us and, with an indifferent nudge, pushed us right in, where we would be thrust into a world full of the same amount of randomness; many even get thrust in and don't last a few minutes. The passion, the smouldering hatred against chance that some feel as the void absolves them is one that I find tremendous beauty in. Scraping at the void and reaming at the one who pushed us in is a hopeless struggle, and I find beauty in acknowledging that and in spite of it, still persisting because of one's soul. Now, I don't find pure beauty in this alone, without any additional developments; it is foolish to waste one's life away scrapping at something that could never be. But I find incredible beauty in the immensity of the attempt; and even more so in the transition from such a powerful sense of obstinacy, into a solemn, accepting glide.

{"submission": " \u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? \n\nYes, I am currently diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder. I also experience depersonalization/derealization, but it's subsumed under MDD rather than being its own disorder in my case. I also have some kind of anxiety disorder but I'm not sure what the specific diagnosis is.\n\n \u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? \n\nI was brought up under a Christian home. Early on, I was already having a lot of issues with it on the moral side. I remember constantly telling people that they were sexist at one point until I was seriously reprimanded for it. I hated how certain things were immoral when I couldn't understand why they were immoral. I became an agnostic atheist around the age of 12. For the most part, I kept my beliefs to myself. I'm a very fearful person. The times when I stood up for my beliefs were the exceptions, not the norm.\n\n \u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n\nI would definitely feel refreshed. I can go for very long periods of time while being by myself. It feels very peaceful to me. I'm socially introverted to the point that people often think there's something wrong to me. I remember having teachers/counselors trying to get me to make friends. I did and do have friends, but they're all online.\n\n \u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities? \n\nI'm okay at sports but I don't like them at all. Almost all of the activities that I enjoy are indoor activities. I really just spend most of my time watching/reading things online and playing video games. When I do play video games, I often put a lot of my time and effort into them. I put in about 4000+ hours into one indie game. I remember modding the game just so I could practice on this one certain mechanic. I usually care about the mechanics of the game the most, but I need the aesthetics to pop out enough and be pleasant enough for me to actually play the game.\n\n \u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forms of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. \n\nNo, I am certainly not artistic. I can technically understand why people like art, but I DEFINITELY don't like art myself. I don't even like music. Sometimes this makes me feel quirky and at other times it makes me feel dead inside.\n\n \u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? \n\nI definitely don't control others on a conscious level. I'd much rather let them fully make their own decisions. It's strange to me that this question is even a thing.\n\n \u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? \n\nI think that I daydream way too often, but I almost never run into anything even though I'm not aware of my surroundings when I do daydream. I have definitely received comments that I live in a different world, but I don't think that's about daydreaming. That's usually about the weird things I say and the weird positions I hold. I usually daydream about certain fantasies, arguments, and possibly just some novel idea I came up with that interests me.\n\n \u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? \n\nIt usually takes me a long time to process my emotions. I was an EXTREMELY sensitive kid. I remember a red cup being placed near me when I was in the first grade. That red cup was put on the table to signify that you should stop talking. I interpreted it as the teacher telling me that I'm a bad person, and I had a panic attack. I made an oath to myself to NEVER speak in school again. I definitely didn't keep this oath, but I did become selectively mute in school from the rest of 1st grade-8th grade because of it. While I ruminated on certain emotions for a long time, I also sometimes just experienced them and then easily moved on. Emotions are basically the reason why I move everyday, but that's the same for everyone. Of course they're extremely important to me. If I didn't have them, I would be absolutely nothing. I'm now dealing with apathy rather than sensitivity, and to me it's far, FAR worse.\n\nI'm going to end it there cause I think that people won't read it if it's any longer. My belief in the MBTI is pretty limited.

(mainly for sightseeing and to know more about the world).\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI have many ideas (and half of them have to consult with others for ethical standards). I also have many unrelated interests (mainly to avoid boredom. eg: plane spottings, people-watching, surfing the internet, tracking cyclones, etc). \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI would take the role IF no one takes it (I prefer to be in the backstage). If I take it, then the group would be either going nowhere or going somewhere with visibly unhappy members. My leadership style would be the 'direct' kind, screw emotions as this is a project.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity.\n\nMost of the time, No. I suck at catching balls. But I do love folding origami, fixing electrical stuff (or building something interesting).\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art. If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI am not artistic as I suck at drawing (but I can make blueprints). But if I could, I think it would be abstract kind as it offered many interpretations (and I hate it when people claim that my interpretation is wrong like it is abstract ffs).\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI'd to live in all three (but I am skewed toward the future and the past). I often ask 'what-if' and then create a timeline in my head or find answers somewhere else.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI would help if I had the energy to do it (which is like only happened during the first 10% of my day...if I had my coffee). Otherwise, I would consider whether it's reasonable to help or not.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nMaybe yes, maybe no. Sometimes I could see that I needed it but other times not.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nMeh, not that important (unless tests are coming)\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nTruth to be told, yes. I prefer to do it indirectly mainly for privacy\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nDoing origami, fixing stuff, planespotting, etc. I don't even know why I love it so much but oh well =))\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style would be 'Observational learning' for physical stuff, and 'reading and think' for theoretical stuff. I struggle in learning by listening (I can find a bunch of interpretations in your sentence and stuck at step 1 because I have no idea which is the correct way). I prefer classes that do experiments (theoretical stuff can be fun but also boring over time).\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you tend to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI can think of a strategy... but failed to do it anyway (procrastinating). What I can do is create a big outline with goals... then do whatever I can (legally) to reach those goals. That includes improvising things.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI think I care more about the journey rather than the results... but if the results affect me in life then the journey be damned.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nFear of betrayal, losing friends, long socialization, attending a party alone. Why? I am hard to befriend, I try walking on eggshells but... the friendships just ended and I don't know why. The latter two stem from social anxiety (I guess, not getting a formal diagnosis yet).\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nMy high would be extremely happy and thrilling for the new experience, or after achieving a life goal. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nDepressed, probably think of why I failed the goal, finding alternative ways to reach the goal.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI'd say muttering is a way to ground me (if not then I'll fall asleep and dream somewhere far away... or daydreaming about the future in general).\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about it?\n\nFirst 30 mins probably nothing, and then I pondered my life choices until I fell asleep.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI would say not really long and regret it later (if give me a chance to change then a 50/50 depends on the situation).\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI think Emotions are extremely important to a human...but I suck at expressing it and would find songs that I may or may not relate to at the time. or doing random contemporary dance moves to express the negativity.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI usually choose agree-to-disagree if the convo is going nowhere (and do not question further after the agree-to-disagree as the relationship might get fractured).\n\n\u2022 Do you break the rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break the rules, why?\n\nUsually, I would follow rules and regulations mainly to avoid the 'confrontation' or 'consequences' part. But willing to defend if I break any. And authority should always be challenged (Debate helps things progress... unless it's going nowhere).", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.17468701}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.3903375}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.3598428}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -3.9975743}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -5.386069}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.215113}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.2930894}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.3099313}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -6.533482}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.8492284}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -6.944073}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -7.3124948}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.075635}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -8.988185}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -9.165492}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -9.533387}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.587277}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -9.679006}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.733121}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.837211}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.010847139}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -4.529419}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -14.192745}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -15.717934}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -15.838736}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -16.211525}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -16.692673}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -16.735617}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -17.01622}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -17.21238}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -17.305332}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -17.70505}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -18.072649}, {"token": "-P", "logprob": -18.217588}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -18.58248}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -18.611834}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -18.630383}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -18.86621}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -18.961874}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -18.963482}]}}

{"submission": "1/3\n\nWhats your biggest fear? \n\nA painful and bloody death. My second biggest fear is death itself, even if i die a calm and soft death, whats waiting us after that makes me afraid, it makes me existential and worried.\n\nWhats your biggest desire? \n\nCurrently, being a successful architect and make a lot of money, i am very stressed when i feel i dont have enough money, my mood completely change based on how much money i have. \n\nWhat are you the best at? \n\nI will brag about my creativity. I have a very vivid and rich imagination, reason why i'm very confident about my career on arts. \n\nHow do you see yourself right now?\n\nLast days have been hard, socially speaking, i am emotionally tired and i have a headache, now, more generally, i'm happy i could make good improvements on my essay writting skills, i'm planning to enter one of the best architecture universities on the country, and with my current improvements, i feel that's totally achievable.\n\nHow do you see yourself 5 years from now?\n\nI am the best student of my class. I have my leed green associate certificate. I am improving on my specialization on sustainable architecture and making myself an excellent professional. \n\nHow do you express yourself?\n\nOn the most diverse ways u can imagine. In terms of subjectivity, i like to express myself very dramatically thro fictional stories and characters, in terms of interpersonal relations it depends, i can be serious, funny, direct or sensitive, i am not that most consistent on that. \n\nHow do you feel about those near you (family, friends)?\n\nI value and love them very much and i'm ways weighting how my decisions might affect them. \n\nHow do you feel about strangers?\n\nIndifferent or negatively/critical most of the time. Although i strive for empathy. \n\nHow do you view change/uncertainty?\n\nI like change, but I don't like uncertainty. I need to know what will happen and have things settled down. Uncertainty makes me anxious and nervous. Now change, ive been changing since my first memories, outwardly or inwardly, i believe change cant be avoided and thats the natural course of things. \n\nHow do you make decisions?\n\nI weight my own feelings and those of people i love and/or i feel that need me. I regret my decisions pretty often, either out of a sense of detachment and doubt about whether i'm following my own and right path or not, either because i'm hugely inspired by something new.\n\nHow do you deal with your emotions?\n\nBadly, i hate my emotions sometimes, they can be beautiful aesthetically, but most of the time i feel my feelings are delaying me. My emotions can be incredibly, i will repeat, incredibly explosive, so i'm constantly under pressure of trying to keep them under control. \n\nWhat do you hope to avoid doing or being?\n\nI don't want to harm others, be cruel to them, i have some strange beliefs about Karma. \n\nHow do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself?\n\nI guess people see me as a loyal and knowledgeable friend, and depending on the person, it will have specific nuances on their view of me, some will say i'm very extraverted and funny and others will think i'm too serious or polite. I want people to see me as someone beautiful and important to them or to see value in my work. \n\nDescribe how you experience each of: a) Anger; b) Shame; c) Anxiety\n\nA- explosions, tyrannical and harsh expressiveness, hard to control. \n\nB- I withdraw from whatever situation is causing me shame. I can't stand the feeling. \n\nC- i guess i have some physical symptoms of anxiety, my heartbeats get faster etc etc, and i also get hyperactive. \n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI did have a religious upbringing, and i easily assimilated into it on my childhood, i believed in god, a good and gentle god, and i believed he would always help me. Then i started studying astronomy and became more curious and critical, also, the repression of my sexuality made me create a strong grudge against abrahamic religions, and after studying more and more, i have decided its one of the main cancers that delay humanity. \n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI feel neither, probably only bothered. \n\nWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like activities that make me feel like i had a fun moment, or that was productive, so i like working on creativity projects, and i also do like some sports, if practiced with people i like instead of competing with strangers, i believe it can be a lot of fun, and the sensation of exhaustion after such activities are also good, bed never feels better than these moments. I don't like feelings trapped, in small houses or places for too long, i need to get out, get some fresh air and walk. \n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am very curious about existentialist matters.

{"submission": "well, she's usually the type of person to invite you out or get invited out, agree to go, then come up with a long texted excuse on why she can't go, which is pretty obviously a lie, to me at least. she's a pretty anxious person, can be paranoid out about literally anything, even if there's no reason to. like when she sees someone's marriage break apart after 30 years, or someone's husband change their gender after 10 years together. she feels compassion for these people, then thinks \"omg what if that happens to me.\" she projects other people's problems on herself, as if they'll find exactly her and happen to her.\nI know it doesn't have much to do with mbti, but I'll mention it anyways; she prefers to have everything organised and cannot stand, when her place is a mess. my friend will start an argument with her sister, when she leaves some mess behind, then clean that up for her and complain about it. she is a pretty compassionate person I'd say, but she usually will call herself bad and a bitch. the reason for this is probably that she feels annoyed by most people(she's currently in an environment that is not very good for her). there are times, when she has \"no choice but to be nice\" to some people and remain good relationship, since they can be pretty useful to her. I don't really think it's good for her and the annoyance building up inside.\nsometimes, she wants to gossip about someone, and I do not, which leads to her saying \"I'm bad, I like to gossip. but you don't, you're nice\" and stuff like that. \nI suppose she's not very good at understanding someone else's point. I wanna quote one of our conversations for a better example:\n*sends a picture of someone's nails* \"these are terrible, and this person used to say something about my taste\"\n\"well, she probably things those are pique of fashion\"\n\"they're awful, I don't understand how someone can like that\"\n\"people have different tastes\"\n\"nope, there are those, who have taste, and those who don't\"\nand during next 30 minutes I tried to explain, how tastes and likings can variate from person to person, and how relative the whole concept is. even made a small model of how she perceives \"taste\". to no avail, she still thinks there's only way to that. these type of convos are pretty common between as. there are times, when we hear someone in public put a song on speakers and walk around. she starts immediately complaining and pointing out how these people are impolite, how can someone not give a damn about bothering others in a public place and so on. when she goes into whole \"I'm a bad person\" mood, and I try to assure her that she's not, she'd bring up something from the past to put herself down like \"remember when you were happy about something, laughing and jumping around? I thought you were like a freak.\" \nwanna mention that she has a habit, from ever since I've known her, of watching the same things all over again. bringing up her old hobbies, old favourite bands, singers and other nostalgic stuff. I suppose it gives her some sense of security and safety. \nI've confronted her about her anxiety and problems many times, explained how I've gone through all that(I have anxiety as well, though it's way better now). how therapy was incredibly helpful, how easier it makes your life and so on. but I suppose she doesn't want to accept help or feels guilty of doing so, she usually brushes it off, leaves me on read and them changes the subject. that happens when we had few arguments during the time we've known each other, too, by the way. why I'm willing to talk things through, she's not really.\nI also want to mention that she's a really good friend. she listens to me, whenever i need it, tries to give advice, when possible. she's pretty empathetic, as I mentioned earlier. a reddit story about someone's trauma may put her in a state of sadness for some time, as an example.\n\nI have that inner desire to figure out everyone's mbti, and while it's easier for me to type someone I don't know that well intuitively and, mostly, accurately, I cannot figure out her type. she took a test a few times, but I honestly don't trust those, since they have failed me so many times. she's not interested in learning about mbti further either. so I'd be grateful if anyone could help me type her.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": "INFJ", "logprobs": {"INF": [{"token": "INF", "logprob": -0.99251837}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.0433645}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.3083525}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -5.844529}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -7.1195936}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -7.257642}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.4432287}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.7055674}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.239648}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -8.325805}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.662938}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -8.676703}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.824948}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.883147}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.550548}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -10.613688}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -10.908172}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -11.145747}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -11.213843}, {"token": "Is", "logprob": -11.543574}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -2.6968896e-06}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.049788}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -14.989823}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -16.353428}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -18.386873}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -18.766897}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -19.229563}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -19.712267}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -19.75726}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -19.893105}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -20.01525}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -20.134573}, {"token": "JS", "logprob": -20.702412}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -20.92363}, {"token": "...", "logprob": -20.950596}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -20.98788}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -21.032791}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -21.342798}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -21.387686}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -21.482592}]}}

Could you help me based on a description of myself? \n\nThis is me:\n\n- I'm very, very responsible, but mostly when the responsibility involves others because I don't want to let anyone down\n\n- My mind works very rationally and is capable of making a great analysis, but it highly contrasts with my strong emotions that have always been very hard to control. I'm very sensitive to everything around me, without me even noticing. But I often come across as calm in public... unless I suddenly can't handle it anymore\n\n- I'm very indecisive, but when it comes to something very important, I'm capable of taking the lead, even though I won't feel comfortable with it\n\n- I'm kinda socially awkward and never know how to make friends or what others think of me. As a young kid, I didn't really take others into account. I mean, I've always been overprotective and stuff, so I don't really mean that. More like, I lived in my own world and didn't know how to talk to others. But I'd never hurt anyone's feelings, purposely or accidentally. However, I think I've always could read the room.

{"submission": "I\u2019ve been told my the same amount of people that I could very possibly be ISFP / INFP. Can you help me? \n\nSOCIAL STUFF:\n- I prefer small groups of people\n- Sometimes I actually like being in the \"spotlight\" in front of people I\u2018m comfortable with \n- I only have two friends I\u2019m a little closer with, however I feel like they don\u2019t know me 100%\n- I\u2018m difficult to get to know, as I keep things for myself \n- I need some time until I open up to people, but once I\u2018m open I love to joke with them \n- I like everyone to feel included (if it\u2019s people I like and know) \n- I often find it hard to keep a conversation going without being awkward (it may also be some mild kind of social anxiety) \n- I can be two different kind of people, depending if I\u2018m with people I\u2018m comfortable with (family / my two friends), or people I don\u2019t know very well\n- In group chats I tend to be more of a listener and I have a hard time implying myself in the conversation. I just don\u2019t seem to find the perfect timing for it \n- I like random conversations. For example debating (not in a super serious way) about current events or controversial topics \n- Abstract conversations can be interesting, but I don\u2019t really enjoy them. After some time it can bore me \n\n\nSCHOOL:\n- I hate presentations, especially if they\u2019re in front of my whole class \n- I like group tasks, as long as the groups are not bigger than let\u2019s say 4 or 5 people\n- However, I dislike working all on my own. I feel like it\u2019s more fun and easier to do a task if you do it with a partner\n- When getting tasks, I prefer a precise description of it, instead of something abstract like \"Write a short story about a day to day situation\", instead I need a little bit of an idea like \"Write a short story about a girl, going to her first day of school\", or something like that\n- But the task shouldn\u2019t be too constricting \n- I\u2018m bored by religion stuff at school, because I\u2018m also not religious \n- Brainstorming can be hard at times \n- However , I like creating mind maps \n- I have a hard time understanding concepts of physics or maths \n- I feel like I lack logic thinking, like in maths I don\u2019t see the whole pattern stuff and I need more time than others to actually understand why and how something is done\n- I like languages and arts (and I\u2018m at least average good at them)\n- I often tend to forget stuff at home \n- I\u2019m disorganized \n- I procrastinate \n- When studying, I need to write down all the topics (preferably in the right order), to be able to get an overview \n- I need to write everything down I have go study, or else it won\u2019t go into my head \n- I study while listening to music, however it can be distracting at times \n\nDAY TO DAY LIFE:\n- my orientation is not best, but I think it would be totally fine as long as I go to places I know well \n- I don\u2019t think I would be that person that immediately notices small changes in a person\u2018s appearance (except if it\u2019s something obvious, like hair color or significantly different hair style) \n- I once saw an example, stating that Se would notice a small stain on the shirt of person passing by, but I don\u2019t think that would apply to me \n- Sometimes I tend to be very occupied with my own thoughts, that I just fade out my environment. But this happens occasionally, not all the time\n- If this happens, I\u2018m back to reality quickly \n- I overthink the things I\u2019ve said or done and my reactions to certain situations, especially when going to bed \n- I don\u2019t like shopping alone for a reason: the hurry at the cash desk. I hate to be in a hurry and stared at \n- I hate phone calls, especially with strangers \n- I get bored super easily. I hate staying in on every weekend. I need to go and visit some cities with my family or else I\u2018ll just feel depressed at home. I prefer going to cities than the woods, as there\u2019s more stuff to see = less boredom \n- I\u2018m a cautious person, thinking of the possible outcomes an action could have\n- I\u2018m afraid of doing extreme sports, like mountain climbing or parasailing \n- I love traveling! \n- I hate reading. It\u2019s so draining. I prefer a movie with some popcorn \n- I love music. I feel it in a way, I know most people probably don\u2019t. I get really emotional when listening to certain songs, that I could even start crying \n- I like lots of genres\n- I don\u2019t have favorite things. I can\u2019t decide between things I like and say \"hey, that\u2019s my favorite\u2026!\"\n\nHOBBIES:\n- I\u2019ve tried tons of hobbies \n- From dancing ballet to e-Guitar \n- What I stick to: Piano, Tennis and occasionally drawing or painting \n- However, I currently have a hobby I prefer, as I\u2019ve also wished for a long time to do so: Tennis \n- I like to experiment with my piano and write my own music \n- I like singing, but not in front of my family. I\u2018m very shy and afraid of judgement \n- I often feel like I lack creativity. I don\u2019t know why. I just keep having those mental blocks\n- I like drawing and painting, but I rarely do so.

{"submission": "\n#  I'm going to try be as open and vulnerable as possible, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much :)\n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. \n\nI'm a 16 year old male. I've got a very melancholic temperament most of the time, but it's quite internal, I've been told I can be bossy and uncaring outwardly sometimes when I care about something, but when I don't I tend to be very laid back. I like writing... I mostly like writing in my head though haha, I rarely ever get anything out, my execution ability is... I don't want to say it's bad? Because I've never really tried, but, I have such a perfect layout of a plot for like an entire book in my head but it's so vague, when I actually attempt to lay it out I realise how little I have actually really thought it out - I mean this in the sense that I always only seem to have a \"general vibe\" and for some reason I always just see the end of the book, I know exactly how I want people to feel towards the ending.\n\n \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nGreat honestly! At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI think I'd like it... I usually get very tired just from the outside world... I always get home from college basically dead haha...\n\n \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious! I think? I love coming up with ideas, I think the way I view the world is probably the core of my entire identity. I have a very very strange way of seeing things I think... I came up with a concept recently that I found super interesting. I have a few in mind after saying that so I'm just gonna flip a coin to decide lmao. Okay, this one - so I was wondering initially (this is what led me to the final though) \"if someone gets put on a machine that makes them feel unfathomably good, and then get taken off of it and given the chance to stay off or go back on, do they have a choice or does their external environment just command them?\". This led me to come up with a better version: (imo) if someone came into my home, put a gun to my head and demanded I do an extremely simple task, or I die - and I have completely free will (atleast theoretically) to make whichever choice I wanted - do I actually have free will? If I value my life, logic commands me to complete the task - lets say its something extremely simple like there are no cons to completing it, like say, touching the wall in front of me - all logic commands me to complete that task. But in a way that isn't me making a decision is it? I'm being commanded by the circumstances of my external environment. So my idea was what if we made that pointless, unreasonable choice, just because? It's an absurd reasoning, sure, but a very human one imo. Another one I had was this notion of truth. I often see an infinite amount of possibilities and it leads me to overthink things heavily. I mean I have this whole idea that truth cannot reasonably exist - this idea is an embodiment of this overthinking attitude. The best way I can explain it is with this: \u201cto prove god does not exist, you have to look him in the eyes and tell him.\u201d Because i mean, when I die, I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll find god\u2026 the potential is ALWAYS there for god to exist, maybe we just haven\u2019t found him yet? There\u2019s always \u201cmaybe we just haven\u2019t figured it out yet\u201d, always. It\u2019s like, even with \u201cconcrete\u201d things. If I point in front of me and say that there is a raccoon there, evidently we can both conclude that there isn\u2019t\u2026 but (now this might seem like a stretch but I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable) there\u2019s always a chance that that raccoon is just hidden from us, in some far off plane that is connected to that point and space in time we just can\u2019t see it. It\u2019s highly unlikely but, we could never prove it false right? We can\u2019t prove something to be true unless we prove it to be false and to prove it to be false we must witness it, which, it would then be true\u2026\n\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot really, I mean, I can at times and I think I like doing things in my own way - honestly though I've never really been put to the test? And when I do get put into positions of leadership I get incredibly bossy and critical, I hate it.\n\n \n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not gonna go into much depth but I feel like it was worth touching on - I dislike it, a lot, although when I was a kid I remember loving to climb trees, building lego I mean until I turned around 14, I wanted to be a mechanic!\n\n \n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI think I do in a sense, yeah. I sometimes will say things just because I know that person will like me for it. I'm not a people pleaser in the slightest - in fact I actually can sometimes cause conflict just for the sake of it: like I remember often in highschool my friendgroup would come ask me to come out and even if I really wanted to, sometimes I'd just refuse... out of a sort of spite I think? But like I remember in school when I wanted to become popular, I sat next to a popular kid and analysed what kinda jokes made him laugh, I then made LOTS of those jokes and it worked!\n\n \n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have EXTREMELY high highs, like seriously. I mean. I even often have them in lows sort of? I sometimes dive into extremely cynical pits of sadness and I can often criticise people for just \"believing\" things - like saying \"oh I believe love is a powerful energy force\", I'm usually just like \"huh? How can you believe that?\" but I really do have moments where I think I get it! I just think sense drags me back down, which sucks a little I guess. I often get very weirded out by the notion of love, it can (and sometimes does) upset me greatly after those moments of \"highs\" when I come to the realisation that love is really all their is to live; I really hate the notion that \"happiness is the meaning to life\", I don't want to explain that but I hate it.\n\n \n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nNot very at all... I used to be! When I was a kid. And I remember in highschool I would always get terrified of being seen daydreaming so I just wouldn't. I remember fearing looking like my mum. I love her! So much, don't get me wrong, but she would always do this thing where she would just stare off into the distance and not think... I always wondered why she did that but I hated it, I didn't want to look like that.\n\nThank you so so so so so much for reading this", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.06541611}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.2498262}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.2850895}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -4.59177}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.782324}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -9.337297}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.934614}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -10.322744}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -10.406599}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -10.6564865}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.959848}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -10.983599}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -11.025225}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -11.093018}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -11.145456}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -11.251373}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.28533}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.438929}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -11.489536}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -11.681789}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.002956543}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -5.944952}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.971323}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.493343}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.693459}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.407139}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.387339}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.172237}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.46035}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -13.095146}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.1458435}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -13.382736}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.5421715}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.853006}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.976749}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.19648}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -14.426357}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -14.609579}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -14.821894}, {"token": " CON", "logprob": -14.881744}]}}
{"submission": "Hello\n\nI usually get INTP/ENTP/ENTJ/ESTJ/ISTP on tests \n\nHowever I'm sure we all know tests aren't super reliable. I've done thorough research on cognitive functions and have been investigating my own thoughts and thought process, and I gotta say, I use all of the functions a lot. \n\nEspecially choosing between Ne-Si/Ni-Se axis is difficult for me because I use both very often. However if I had to go for one only, it would be Ne-Si. But I also use Ni-Se strongly\n\nGoing over to Te-Fi/Ti-Fe, I can say that I cannot relate to Fi at all. I'm not sure if I even understand what it is fully, or what it does, or how it works in your brain. I can explain how I use Ne, Ni, Se, Si, Fe, Ti and Te functions, but Fi? I cannot. I can't grasp it. \n\nI do use Fe somewhat, I think of what is socially acceptable and I think of what the other party's reaction will be based on their personality and even though I don't alter what I say or be dishonest, I know what to say and what not to. So I think I definitely do use Fe/it's not my Blindspot. However I'm not super good at it. I can be really (unintentionally) insensitive, at times arrogant,even disruptive. Sometimes I even leave the room without saying anything because I want out. I also try to keep quiet to not say something that seems offensive to the other person because that's what happens sometimes, and I don't notice it because I don't intend it to be that way. \n\nI use Te to get shit done. Whenever I want something to get done quickly my te is subconsciously on, making plans and determining the most efficient and useful way of accomplishing said thing. I also use it often in combination with the other functions, it sort of helps me get through life easier. But I'm not super aggressive with my Te. \n\nTi for me is my default, natural mode, just questioning things almost like second nature. Sometimes I'm like a sponge sucking every piece of info I can gather. I question anything and everything based on the information I've already collected and research random tidbits that I think of out of nowhere to gain more info, almost like connecting everything I've learned so far together and trying to see what that piece of information might suggest in my life, possibly in the future or now. Or maybe to judge what has happened in the past. \n\nSi is tricky for me. I can have really shitty memory, can be forgetful and scatter brained. But I did notice I compare new experiences to past ones in order to find what to do in current situations. But I'm not super detail oriented and quite frankly can find being detail obsessive a waste of time. \n\nSe is also a bit tricky but I don't hate it. I like having control of my external surroundings, I like when I just wing it and somehow make things turn out well. I have been told I have good reflexes pretty often. My awareness of surroundings is not terrible but it definitely isn't awesome either. I'm usually lost in random thoughts that I forget about quickly after. \n\nIf I had to say something about how I use fi,.or at least what I think my Fi is, is sometimes I get really down in the depths. And I start asking myself what am I? Who.am I? What do I do? What do I want to do? And then it goes away and I go back to normal. I think that might be the fi lmao. \n\nWhat do you think my type is? I tried to include as.much of my thought process as possible. \n\nThanks!", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.39267197}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -1.8007454}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.3313203}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -4.3014417}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -4.566014}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -4.694802}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -4.891173}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -4.9647775}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.575814}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -5.777077}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.987225}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -6.6136765}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -6.8166833}, {"token": "Ti", "logprob": -7.7507215}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.807595}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -8.234417}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -8.599459}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -8.702244}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -8.718466}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -8.824923}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.004732484}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -5.3635545}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.1070385}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.222265}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -11.945408}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -15.064941}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -15.31546}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -15.422966}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -15.605881}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -16.346436}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -16.43237}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -16.490982}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -16.532547}, {"token": "M", "logprob": -16.664413}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -16.70945}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -16.796804}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -17.01336}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -17.18087}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -17.297972}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -17.319633}]}}

{"submission": "Hi. I\u2019ve taken the 16p test a few times last year and been in MBTI subs for a few months now, and my result goes back and forth from ENFJ, INFP, and INTP. My result has always depended on my current situation:\n\n\u2022 During a time I had to act like how I think my best self would act for an important event, I scored ENFJ. I could definitely relate to the type a lot but I was also stressed during that time, so it makes everything confusing. \n\u2022 During a time I was depressed, I scored INFP. Then, when I was picking myself up from that low place, I scored INTP.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve started to learn about the cognitive functions and type myself. Here\u2019s what I found out: I use Ne, Te/Ti or Se, Fi/Fe, and my inferior function is most likely Si. \n\n** Note that I\u2019m not too sure about the order that I use the other functions.\n\nI\u2019ve checked the possible types with that function stack and matched with either ENTP or ESTP. I can relate to both of them, but neither of them cover who I mostly am. If I had to choose which type I relate to more it\u2019d be ENTP, but when I see other ENTPs in MBTI subs, one thing I don\u2019t relate to is their confidence. I am pretty confident in my qualities and abilities but I never go around telling people I\u2019m the best, which I\u2019ve seen happen to both online and irl ENTPs.  I feel like I\u2019d only be as verbally self-promoting as them if I was in a miserable spot in life, so this pushes me to the ESTP side; however because they\u2019re the \u201cEntrepreneur\u201d of the MBTI, I reckon they\u2019re also self-promoting but is it as verbal as ENTP? My way of self-promoting is by letting my results speak for themselves rather than talking about them. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could give me tips on how to gain more clarity on my type? It could also help if anyone can tell which type\u2019s vibe I exude.

{"submission": "Thanks in advance! \n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am a 19 year old male. I generally keep to myself, and I am generally described to be reserved, but unfortunately as well as unapproachable/cold. To be honest, I wish I didn\u2019t come off that way but it is what it is.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nAnxiety and depression.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nAs a kid, I was introduced into a religious influence from both my family and relatives, but my response to it was generally respectful but I wasn\u2019t really adamant on it. I essentially respected their belief and morals, but I wasn\u2019t a firm believer in the overall structure. Throughout my childhood, I was  known to be a quiet, reserved, and shy individual who didn\u2019t really have to say much if the conversation did not call for it, but I would personally say that when I was with friends that I\u2019ve grown to confide in as life went on, I grew to be more expressive around them but I usually felt like I couldn\u2019t fully open up to them.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI\u2019m pretty lost in terms of a career currently, as I don\u2019t really have a passion or motivation to pursue something indefinitely like I did in the past. When I was growing up, I felt like I wanted to work towards the medical field because I wanted to increase my knowledge within the field in order to help a better cause. I still have somewhat of an interest in that field, but I also have somewhat of an interest towards computer science and coding, due to its nature of applying logics and creating something with your own breadth of knowledge.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nIf I had to spend an entire weekend by myself, I would generally welcome that idea and scenario with open arms. Although I enjoy hanging out and being around people, I tend to get exhausted fast, as I need to recollect my thoughts and focus on activities that I would consider relaxing. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nThe activities I generally prefer are playing video games, researching random topics that pique my interest, and watching anime. Although I did multiple sports in the past including volleyball, tennis, and swimming, It wasn\u2019t all something that I generally wanted to do on my own accord. Nor was I really good at it. I mainly joined these sports because my friends pressured me to do so, and I felt like it would be interesting to be open to new ideas. Nevertheless, I was pretty trash at all those sports due to my tendency to not be as strong in foundational/basic skills, although I was good at improvising in the moment occasionally.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would consider myself to be a curious individual, as I tend to internalize my thoughts through what I pick up via external sources. I tend to NOT have more ideas than I can execute, because I generally want to focus within one goal that I\u2019ve consistently built upon. My ideas tend to be more conceptual, as I tend to apply more towards theories and how these theories can be used to support my ideas, possibly even creating my own perspective and theory on the topic.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t normally step up to take a leadership position in any circumstances, I like to have control over a situation whenever it is something that is important to me/that I value. I\u2019m unsure whether I would be good at it, but usually when I take a leadership position I like to measure our success based on how much time was spent, and how thorough it could be within that time. My leadership style tends to be that I would focus on what the end goal is, and work my way backwards in order to find the most efficient yet thorough steps in order to achieve the singular goal. I would still appreciate/welcome other people\u2019s ideas and plans, and try to integrate it within my plan if it fits within the general consensus and seems to be a \u201csturdy\u201d idea.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI feel that I am not as coordinated, because my mind tends to wander off a lot if it is not an activity that I am particularly invested in. I generally don\u2019t enjoy getting my hands dirty, but I would be willing to if it was something that I was interested to see the outcome of or if it was something that I was working towards for a goal.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI would say I am not the most artistic person, but I greatly value music. Music tends to allow me to connect to my own emotions much more efficiently, since I generally don\u2019t share these feelings externally. It helps me keep in touch with my emotions and be able to connect to the artist/singer without even knowing them directly, as well as my interpretation that music could have many different interpretations depending on how we could relate to it, which makes it the most enjoyable form of art for me.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nMy opinion of the past, present, and future mainly resides in the importance of the future because I like to be cautious and be fully prepared for my plans/goals to be as smooth as possible into the future. Although I don\u2019t really recall much of the past vividly into my everyday life, I generally tend to look upon what mistakes I have made before and my failures of the past, as to help prevent it from impacting as hard in the present/future. I tend to be extremely regretful and dwell on the past a lot regarding my actions and mistakes that have hurt other people, as it was not really my intention to do so. That would somewhat prove that the past could be equally as important, but I tend to put my focus more on the future and towards what I would plan to do.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nWhenever others request my help to do anything, I generally decide to help them if it is within my capabilities because I tend to imagine if I was in their place, and that I would want somebody to help me so I could finish whatever I was doing as well. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI value logical consistency in my life a lot, as I believe it is something that can create a personalized system of thoughts in order to move through life more smoothly. I feel that logical consistency is important when making a decision or creating a plan, but it should be quite important to consider whether or not it aligns within my values and morals.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIt is important to me to be efficient and productive even though I admittedly procrastinate like crazy, because it would ultimately save time for me to relax and focus on building a better understanding of the world and find hidden meanings within it as well. \n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nOthers have said towards me and I admit that I do control others even if indirectly. I generally am able to read others\u2019 intentions by pondering about the meaning of their actions, such as body language, speech, etc. This somewhat gives me an idea of the atmosphere I am in, and thus I tend to drive the situation to a more favorable environment such as something positive such as making them feel comfortable within the situation.I do this because\u2026 it just feels like the right thing to do.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMy hobbies include mainly playing video games, watching anime, reading manga, and researching topics that pique my interest to feed my brain. I enjoy these topics because for the first hobby, video games, it gives me time to spend with friends if I would like to, and have a fun time just relaxing overall. I tend to really enjoy watching anime and reading manga, specifically more towards dark fantasy or drama/tragedy genres, as it allows me to connect much more to the characters and get lost within their world. It\u2019s just overall an amazing experience to immerse myself within that atmosphere (even if it\u2019s tear jerking or dark) because I enjoy connecting and empathizing with these characters. It also ironically helps me find meaning within certain topics and life in general, as I believe fiction was created in order to tell lessons and morals through stories. Lastly I enjoy researching topics that pique my interest because I am a curious person who likes to feed my brain with, what other people would consider useless/unnecessary, knowledge but it helps me stabilize my logical consistencies and broaden my understanding of the \u201ctruth\u201d behind situations.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI tend to have a better learning style of absorbing information internally on my own, and verifying it with external sources. I feel that the learning environment I struggle with the most is likely fully asynchronous work/assignments, as I need some sort of feedback in order to verify my results. I prefer classes that revolve around creativity and logic, as I find it to be stimulating to be able to create a plan built upon your understanding of the topic, and be able to bring it into fruition. I would likely despise classes that involve my physical senses if it does not pique my interest.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI would say I am quite good at strategizing, as I tend to be able to visualize a specific goal, and be able to plan according to various info within the moment. Although I can\u2019t vocalize it well, I am able to easily break up projects into manageable and small tasks in order to focus on building a logically consistent process in order to result in the outcome. Although I am quite stubborn when it comes to my strategies and reluctant to change it due to my constant refinement of it, I am still open to improvising as I go since unknown variables are always an exception within problem solving and such.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nMy main aspirations in life professionally currently are to just mainly get into a field that piques my interest, and would ultimately allow me to consistently build on my knowledge and understanding of the world and contribute to a greater good. My aspirations in life personally? I just want to be happy and be able to share my visions with people.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy fears tend to be ignoring my hunches and understanding of others\u2019 emotions, because I tend to be able to understand their emotions but neglect it over the value of logical consistency. I also tend to fear not being competent or being incapable for the outside world, as I feel that everything should have a purpose and meaning. Embarrassingly, I also tend to fear abandonment and that I am unworthy of love due to my past regrets of hurting others through manipulating or neglecting their emotions even though I am aware of them. Although I would consider myself to be a deep feeler, being around people who are expressing strong emotions tends to make me uncomfortable because I feel I am not well suited to deal with these types of scenarios. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nAlthough it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had a \u201chigh\u201d in my life, from what I could remember it was a period where I was much more free of stress and had plenty of time to focus on myself and my hobbies.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nThe \u201clows\u201d in my life tend to be extremely unproductive, and may result in reckless actions as I tend to overeat, or barely eat whenever I am incredibly stressed or down.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI would say that I am not really attached to reality, because I tend to daydream A LOT and I idealize many different situations and dwell on the meaning with my thoughts. Generally, I am not aware of my surroundings WHILE I daydream but my daydreaming is usually based on the information I took from my surroundings.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI would likely start  thinking about certain topics and would drift off into a lot of \u201cWhat ifs\u201d because those generally tend to be more and more interesting the further you continue. I would probably continue this until I\u2019ve hit a wall and then realize that I am stuck in this empty room.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt takes me quite long to make an important decision because I like to be thorough and consider all the possibilities revolving around the decision, and being able to support it with logical consistencies. I tend to not change my mind once I\u2019ve made an important decision on my own, but I am prone to doubt my decision if someone were to bring up a very strong argument to change something.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nAlthough I am not very expressive of my emotions and don\u2019t fully rely on them to navigate the world, I view them to be important because it ultimately allows you to connect with others and be able to know what you want. It generally takes me a long time to process my emotions because I tend to analyze them for a long time to understand it, and how it affects myself/others.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes I catch myself agreeing with others just to keep whatever is happening going occasionally because even if I disagree with them, I would first weigh the importance of the discussion, whether or not it\u2019s worth intruding and stating my mind/the truth, as well as how it would affect the others. I feel that it would be much more efficient and smooth to just go with the flow and agree with others if it was not something to debate about, since it would ultimately keep the atmosphere intact.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI tend to respect rules when it matters to apply, but I tend to see authorities as a figure of equal status. I personally feel that even if they \u201cknow better\u201d than the rest of us, they should still treat everyone else as a normal person instead of abusing power. It\u2019s not necessarily challenging authority, but more of being more connectable with everyone else below/above you.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.2945881}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.9147186}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.8924675}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.560793}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -4.494194}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -5.001148}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.3739624}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.603836}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.0639706}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.668379}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.797323}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.354872}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -8.516315}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -9.082407}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.387598}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -9.574364}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -9.585894}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -10.208384}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -10.334398}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -10.607704}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.24070965}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -1.5421432}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.491945}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -13.274597}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.152628}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.405855}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -15.603182}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -15.677143}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -16.152695}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -16.399664}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -16.502602}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -16.802958}, {"token": "PJ", "logprob": -16.866213}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -16.994587}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -17.06106}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -17.181873}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -17.249565}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -17.277092}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -17.324625}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -17.3838}]}}
{"submission": "\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n20F, I just kinda hang out. Not sure what a general description should be like tbh. Let me look up some examples of that and I'll write something similar\nI just looked it up. I'm generally quiet irl, get told often I don't talk enough. Online though I can be a bit of a wildcard. Not sure why that is, I guess it's easier for me to be a crazy bastard online, I just don't have the energy irl lol. \nI'm generally kind though, I try not to be mean to people. I try to do things I enjoy and be the best at it. I'm responsible and I get things done well but I'm also extremely procrastinative (is that a word? Probably not lol). \n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNnnnnnaah? Maybe ADHD, depression and autism though those are just my own suspicions, I've never been diagnosed lmfao\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI mean naturally, being born in turkey you are raised in an Islamic environment. You are sort of taught to be more homophobic etc. But on hanging out on the internet ever since a very young age I taught myself against that. I'm not anti-islamic, I'd say I'm still a Muslim/believe there is some sort of greater force though the idea of an afterlife doesn't always sound so realistic to me. I think I might go a little off topic if I keep talking though. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don't really have a job. I just do what I'm good at freelance and get paid for it, which is art/design. I like it. I've been getting good amount of recognition recently so it's been motivating to keep making stuff. I make decent money (enough to buy a car, high spec PC parts and a couple other things I wanted) too so I'm more than happy with it. Best part is I get to sit at home and it's an easy job.  This sounds like I'm advertising being a freelance artist. Don't. You'll lose your soul\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nIt wouldn't be that bad, there is countless sources of entertainment especially if you have a PC. It's just 2 days. In fact I might have fun. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nActivities that are fun. Lmao. I suppose creating, video games, getting money, good grades. I like eating ice cream. What kind of activities are these? I think I could be good at sports if I wanted but I just don't feel like it brah. It's not that I can't, it's that I'd rather play video games and draw. \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm a pretty curious person yeah. I frequently have random questions in my head pop up and the only way I can satisfy that is by researching it or asking about it. I do have a lot of ideas but I won't say \"more than I can execute\", despite there being a lot of ideas I'm capable enough to make all of them. I'm just lazy :D but eventually I do execute all my plans, just, at my own rate. my curiosities are random as hell, I may have just been thinking deeper about something in particular and suddenly I notice something that I don't know about that thing so I research it and now I know. For example why a certain word is called the way it is. Maybe a foreign word I learned about but forgot. Maybe a formula I learned back in high school but can't remember. Or the reason why some cpus don't fit with certain motherboards. Random shit like that. Depends on what I'm thinking about. You tell me if these are conceptual or environmental, I don't know. I forget what I think about approx. A second later so, yeah. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI probably would yeah. I enjoy any challenge and leading would be a different experience to have fun with. I don't think I'd be too bad, because in the end my priority would be to achieve the best end result to the best of my abilities. I don't think I'd be extremely assertive but I wouldn't be super loose. But I would also wish people would be able capable by themselves as well so I wouldn't have to tell them every little thing. I might get a little tired after too much tho. \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nHmmmmmm. I'm probably not the most coordinated. I can be a little ditzy sometimes and even end up putting the salt shaker in my soup instead of the spoon. But I have good reflexes... And my hands are skilled. Maybe it's because I'm an artist. \n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI'm an artist and make art so I am artistic I suppose, yeah. I like to make art of characters I find cool and try to portray them how I see them. People call my art elegant, well drawn, etc. They simp for it which is my favorite type of reaction lol.  \n\nOh my god this questionnaire is long. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI ignore the past. What happened has happened and there isn't much meaning in thinking about it a lot. I do like looking upon good memories fondly tho. Present is most important to me but future is close second. I used to be really concerned with the future when I was younger but as I grew up I started to learn to appreciate the present and live it to the fullest by doing things I enjoy. Whatever will happen in the future will happen, all I need to do is do things well so that the outcome will be good. \n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI'll help, especially if it's something easy. If it's something hard/risky I will be hesitant/won't help. Me before others, unfortunately. Except for my family. I'd do everything for my family. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nOf course.

{"submission": "Hi, I hope this does not get too long, sorry. I tend to get carried away and talk too much.\n\nI read the sample questionnaire, but wow. I am not sure I can even answer a lot of those, and would take a really long time! I posted the following in the MBTI subreddit, and they said to post over here. I am being lazy and just reposting, sorry. If people have a glance and say, uh, no, do something else (including trying the questionnaire!) I will have a go at that. No hard feelings at being told what i have here is inappropriate!\n\nI have spent like 30 years trying to figure out my type. I have taken the official MBTI several times over the years, including the more in-depth versions, and ofc have taken a shit load of the online ones, even some paid ones. I am pretty clearly NF, but can be somewhat close on I/E and on P/J, which means that several different types pop up.\n\nRecently I came across some Function tests, some rec'd from here and some from other MB forums/Discords. Not useful, but I guess no surprise based on the closeness of my I/E and P/J scores on the regular tests: Fe and Fi were almost the same, and Ne and Ni were almost the same. With the regular tests (don't know what those are called) I always come out at INFP, but on the functional tests I come out as ENFP on top (no surprise, still Ne and Fi), followed by INFP and then with ENFJ and INFJ and even ESFJ all barely separated.\n\nI am happy to take any tests that people here feel would be relevant and post the results here.\n\nThe thing is, although I hate crowds and have a very low need for going out, am very happy to entertain myself reading or surfing the internet or spending time with my wife and our pets, I sing out loud all the time, talk to myself out loud all the time (esp complaining) and can be very outgoing, esp 1:1. I do not seek out new people but when meeting someone new, depending on the circumstances I can swap life stories. All the type descriptions I have read of Is say they are quiet and somewhat withdrawn, so I seem to be more extroverted, I dunno. Also, when I was little I was constantly criticized by my family for talking too much and by some of them for singing all the time. So seems I was extroverted when I was little.\n\nFor the Feeling component, I do care a lot about other people's feeling and am very sensitive to that. I will ask people if they are ok and mean it, lol. And use reflective listening if they want to talk, and also share personal stuff if I feel it can make a connection with them. That seems really Fe.\n\nHowever, I have a strong tech side, I am a biochemist and can understand science really well. I am also not at all creative. I am very imaginative and have endless daydreams and fantasies (which leads me to making a LOT of careless mistakes, though thinking about situation and how I feel about them and stuff leads to that too).\n\nAlso, esp when I was young, I definitely would engage in conflict to some degree. I argued with my grandfather a lot in my teens. OMFG he was soooo rigid!! We did NOT get along. I know now he was a strong ISTJ btw. I could be very hard and harsh, and honestly still can. Also, I walk away from relationships if I feel hurt and feel that talking about it anymore will not help. I have ghosted people a lot.\n\nOh, and also when I was young, from puberty until probably through my mid 20's, I tried on a LOT of personas trying to figure out who I was. In grad school (mid-20s) I even tested as an INTJ. Which, I dunno, maybe I am and I just do not want to be that way so cheat on the MB evaluations. I have spent my whole life though trying to figure out who I am and what I am and what I should do in life and what the meaning of life is, and all that. Has driven me crazy, and at 63 gave up years ago on even figuring it out. Honestly I feel even if I did now it doesn't matter, just too late.\n\nAnyhow, I know this was long. I am happy to hear any suggestions anyone has, or to answer any questions.\n\nThanks!\n\ncaerolle :)", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": "ENFP", "logprobs": {"EN": [{"token": "EN", "logprob": -0.5779542}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.97435844}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.2534246}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -4.387521}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.805787}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -7.36543}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.997159}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -8.073327}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.423636}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -9.020497}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.128001}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.505338}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -9.570197}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -9.727681}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.947234}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -10.49928}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -10.694074}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -11.027644}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.139625}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.184066}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.004757154}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -5.5079403}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.9564877}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -8.858614}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -9.381353}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -9.687414}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.001223}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.988382}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -13.201088}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.811874}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -14.902512}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -14.916122}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -15.0512085}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -15.652899}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -15.758291}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -15.821997}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -16.06048}, {"token": "_FP", "logprob": -16.557186}, {"token": "fp", "logprob": -17.339834}, {"token": "(F", "logprob": -17.454185}]}}
{"submission": "Just the title\u2026 I\u2019m very torn on whether I\u2019m a Ti dom, or an Fi dom. \n\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m quite knowledgeable, I like watching videos on subjects that interest me and I have a \u201cframework\u201d that I use very very frequently on a day to day basis, I often make assumptions as to how things work based on other facts I know. But I think this is honestly my Ne working rather than my Ti.\n\nI know someone who is an Fi dominant, and they\u2019re much more accepting of their feelings than I am. When we discuss philosophy they will gladly accept the notion of \u201cI just feel that way\u201d, they\u2019re fine accepting their subjective interpretation of something, not as truth necessarily but as something they hold dear.\n\nIn some ways I feel this too! I really do. I often make strong judgements, they\u2019re not really all about my feelings though but I think just me being an individual\u2026\n\nLike I came up with this analogy, my analogy was if someone put a gun to my head and ordered me to do an extremely simple task or else I die - I mean there is literally no downside to completing this task, it is something as simple as touching whatever is in front of you. It would seem the most rational choice (assuming you value your life) to just touch the thing, I mean there is basically no downside or sacrifice to it and you get to keep living. But, because the benefits and trade off of touching the wall greatly outweighs the other decision - not touching it and dying - there is no reason for you not to touch it. And therefore it feels like you\u2019re not even making a decision, just your circumstance is for you. I find beauty in this. Not necessarily not touching the wall, but the rebellion, the immensity of the attempt. But I find even more beauty in projecting that same passion as you tried to resist, into accepting your fate.\n\nSee that\u2019s what makes me think I\u2019m Fi.\n\nYet, I feel more Ti at times? I am disgusted sometimes at feelings. I struggle to be vulnerable with literally everyone except one person\u2026 and I often seem outbursts of passion as\u2026 just confusing? I have an objective view of things at times that makes it hard for me to fully resonate with those that judge everything on emotion. I often find myself just disgusted at humans and wondering what even makes us different from robots? Emotions\u2026 but emotions at the end of the day is just math\u2026 so\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m not amazing at accepting the human condition and it\u2019s tough for me to believe that life is just about \u201cbeing happy\u201d, I\u2019m kind of torn between a logical stance and an emotional one. \n\nAny help would be appreciated greatly\u2026", "clean_guess": "INFP.", "llm_guess": "INFP. \n\n", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.4539353}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -1.2167927}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.2802713}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -4.1370463}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -5.4647174}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.991794}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -6.123939}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.439121}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.870788}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -7.069078}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.271116}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -7.826345}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -7.9104705}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.5271435}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.978678}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -9.0882}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -9.147335}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.163845}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.251612}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.11027}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0054305964}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -5.309294}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.475525}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.005737}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.650879}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.42845}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.033762}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.604237}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -12.849443}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.002228}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.0787735}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -13.229605}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.304806}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.325287}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -13.377277}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.420897}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.93008}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.098106}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -14.115732}, {"token": " CON", "logprob": -14.20896}], ".": [{"token": ".", "logprob": -0.6537494}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -0.7472896}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -5.6450367}, {"token": " \n\n", "logprob": -7.2486963}, {"token": ",", "logprob": -7.3791723}, {"token": ".\n\n", "logprob": -7.59873}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -8.144564}, {"token": " (", "logprob": -8.273354}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -8.995973}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -9.39325}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -9.993876}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -10.773934}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -10.990221}, {"token": ".\n", "logprob": -11.005202}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -12.015588}, {"token": " or", "logprob": -12.297967}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -12.3486395}, {"token": "\n\n\n", "logprob": -12.54428}, {"token": "  \n\n", "logprob": -13.007025}, {"token": " with", "logprob": -13.334271}], " \n\n": [{"token": " \n\n", "logprob": -0.009910732}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -5.1103535}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -5.746395}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -7.8118877}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -8.792721}, {"token": "  \n\n", "logprob": -10.080502}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -10.698376}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -12.790369}, {"token": " In", "logprob": -12.940154}, {"token": " Some", "logprob": -13.348351}, {"token": " From", "logprob": -13.875694}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -14.337797}, {"token": " (", "logprob": -14.338642}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -14.56692}, {"token": " There", "logprob": -14.70674}, {"token": "  \n", "logprob": -15.044535}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -15.500973}, {"token": " Key", "logprob": -15.518235}, {"token": " Through", "logprob": -15.590728}, {"token": "   \n\n", "logprob": -15.689885}]}}
{"submission": "&#x200B;\n\n* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nIm 23, male from Europe, not very tall and slim (my metabolism be fast af), generally lazy and trying to enjoy life. I wear mostly black clothes and jeans and used to paint my nails black because I'm emo/goth lol.\n\n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo, but I feel like I might have ADHD since I always fidget with random stuff and I was also severely depressed (borderline suicidal) when I was 16 but haven't had those thoughts since then.\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was kind of erratic in the sense that my parents didn't really have much time for me and when I was very young I had abandonment issues and would cry in the kindergarten because the kids were mostly annoying. My grandma would take me to a local internet cafe where I would spend my time playing video games aside from watching cartoons. She also took me to church a couple times when I was a kid but I would just play with the other kids and there were also toys on the first floor, I never really understood it and I feel like I've always been an atheist.\n\nMy parents are very odd type of people - my father lives in the past and when I was little, we would just watch the same movies and stuff over and over but eventually I grew out of that and I look for something novel, for example I can't watch the same movies more than 1-2 times.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI graduated computer science this year and currently work as a junior software developer in the DevOps field and I do like it though my impostor syndrome kicks off quite a lot. Yesterday we started working on a project and I was the main dude working on the terminal and had the other 3 developers whine about every little error I make or that I'm being \"too fast\" to write stuff as if I have 0 clue what I'm doing, it kind of felt like I'm taking a technical interview. Other than that it's pretty chill, people are mostly nice except my manager. I won a hackathon that was hosted by the university and he decided that he would assign me to a project that's beyond my capabilities so there's high expectations. I just hope I don't burn out or I get fired for the time being, since I'm still a newcomer.\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel refreshed for sure. I just clock out at 6pm from work and do my stuff, maybe cook something or watch anime and talk to my girlfriend and maybe play some games then go sleep. It does get lonely since I don't have a lot of friends but my girlfriend and my best friend make up for it, for the most part.\n\n* **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI wouldn't say I'm good at sports, though I did enjoy playing basketball at high school and university. I also used to be somewhat decent as a goalkeeper in high school but only for the P.E. classes, nothing beyond that. I never wanted to go to a competition or whatever. However I've always wanted to do some kind of martials arts like muay thai but I never took the chance to since I get lazy very easily and I feel it it would drain me mentally even more. I used to get in fights in high school with friends but I'm not really the violent type since everything can be resolved by using words, e.g diplomatically. I see violence as a final resort, in general.\n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nAlthough I see myself as a curious person, I tend to filter some information nowadays that simply does not interest me, such as news or fashion or whatever it may be, if I'm interested in it, I will research as much as I want/will. I do have a lot of ideas/theories but those are more correlated to like conspiracies or unpopular opinions. I feel like most people have no ability to think for themselves and just become sheep just to appeal to society's standards.\n\nI'm curious about history, astronomy/space, tech, video games, scenarios that could or may not happen like \"what if\" scenarios. I space out quite a lot when I'm watching anime or doing whatever, I get lost in thought easily.\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI think I would take a leadership position if there's no one else to take the initiative but normally if there's someone that is already knowledgeable and worthy to be a leader, I'd follow him. I wouldn't want to be a leader for as long as if I have to. I feel like my leadership style would be to reach the objective we've set. When I was in university I hated project assignments because I would have to manage everything usually and I'd rather just do it myself at that point. If I can do it on my own then I'm gonna do it on my own.\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not really coordinated, sometimes when I'm outside and thinking about stuff I zone out and I trip on the street or when I'm at home I often times eat while I'm moving back and forth because I'm thinking about something, I forget my surroundings a lot. One time I had to run an errand for my mother and I couldn't find my wallet even though I looked pretty much everywhere that I could think of and then once I went to the store with the jacket I normally wore at the time it was apparently in my pocket the entire time...Also when I forget stuff like if I forget where my phone or keys are I try to rewind to where I went or what I did most recently and track my actions to find where something is. I don't really enjoy working with my hands because I am anxious and stability is not one of my core strengths which is probably why I would never be a photographer or something.\n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI used to draw when I was younger and I was somewhat good at it but I never really saw it something \"deep\" or impressive. I just drew whatever I could picture that would look cool but I find art, especially nowadays to be ambiguous as in modern art is not really art-art. I mean c'mon, a banana taped to a wall is art now? Or hell those artists that spin around a bucket over a canvas and call it a day...yeah no. I like Salvador Dali because his art is not visually appealing to the eye but I also find it abstract.\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe Past: I try not to look into the past often unless it's for nostalgia reasons, I associate it with troubles or mistakes or whatever in that regard otherwise. When I think of the past in general I see it as what has shaped me into the person that I currently am and try not to dwell too much on it since it's already gone and it doesn't help me at all.\n\nThe Present: I see it as the opportunities that I can either seize or choose not to. Everything is constantly changing and it makes me excited for new things to have because everyday is something novel especially since I work in tech. But not only that, people/news/articles and everything change right by second so it's constant and sometimes I find it exhausting if anything.\n\nThe Future: It changes depends on how I feel, however for the most part I see it as a dystopia, even though some parts may be good about it. For example, in the future most stuff we do or that people used to do will be automated by machines, one way or another. Which would lead to a larger recession that we currently have, however the mentality of people might also change to make them strive to do better instead of relying on robots to do everything for them. I get FOMO a lot, especially about space, things that I would never witness, such as Andromeda colliding with our universe or Mount Rushmore ceasing to exist or whatever. There's a reason why I used to watch Vsauce so much, not because of the great information he delivers but also because the topics were very interesting even if one could not experience them thoroughly. For me personally, I want to become an expert in my field and hopefully have a family, visit some countries, etc. I have always wanted to visit Egypt and Japan and it's part of my many dreams.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIt depends on what they're asking me to do and who is asking me to do it. If it's at work obviously I will do it but depending on whether it's a friend or not I could just say \"nah\" or \"idk im too busy\" but then if they try to still force it upon me I might slack off on purpose or just forget to do it. If I decide to help someone I would do it because I deem them important and it also depends again on what \"help\" is meant, it could mean anything. I love helping with providing information but I try not to get physical when I have to or with advice.\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nBeing logical is what I try to do most of the time, though I second guess myself a lot because one solution could always be worse/better than another solution later on. What I mean is, one shouldn't immediately call it a day once a solution has been found, unless there's no other solution to be thought of. I try to be practical with my decisions, even though sometimes I buy stuff that I don't necessarily need but I still get them because they give me a sense of thrill.\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI try to be productive and I don't like postponing or delaying too much because it makes me very anxious as in that I won't be able to do it in time. If I can do it early and have it gone out of my head then that's great. I don't want to be seen as incompetent so I strive to learn as much as I can and apply it in practice where possible.\n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI wouldn't say I control others but I may or may not have indirectly manipulated someone without me knowing. I'm not really a bossy type though, if I can do something then I'll do it myself. I wouldn't really ask someone to run an errand for me unless I have a medical problem or idk.\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy hobbies are playing video games, listening to music, watching anime/vids. I like them because they make me relax and I don't have to think as much or at all when doing them, unless I'm playing a tactical shooter or a strategy game, such as chess or w/e. I loved metal construction sets as a kid and tinkering with random stuff, because every new thing I haven't touched before was interesting to me.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI'm mostly a visual learner using logic and memory, kind of, though mostly for things I'm genuinely interested in. I learn by doing and by seeing stuff and memorizing a ton of details and the likes is not one of my core strengths. I could remember stuff from years ago that actually interested me, such as a random fact/equation/quote, etc. but stuff that I dislike and didn't find enjoyable doesn't stick with me.\n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nNo, I don't strategize I just go with the flow and see what happens, I don't plan because that drains me mentally and if I could get by without planning I will. I would definitely say I wing projects and improvise, well I improvise at whatever I can, actually.\n\n* **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nAs I mentioned before, I want to become a professional in my field of work and personally I just want to enjoy life and experience new things before it I'm gone.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI have FOMO (as mentioned) and being alone, I guess. People that are too touchy make me uncomfortable, people that talk too loud around me, people initiating conversations with me without me knowing them. I hate idiots, people that can't think for themselves, loud people, smartasses, normies, arguing for the sake of arguing, in fact I avoid arguments whenever I can. Well, I hate them simply because I cannot get along with them easily, most of my friends are people that understand me quite easily and I tend to filter people based on that.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nBeing able to say whatever I want without having to censor myself, having fun, talking about my interests, doing my hobbies, learning new stuff, etc.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nAnxiety, low self esteem, impostor syndrome. Sometimes I have no motivation to brush my teeth or I tend to oversleep / not sleep enough. I also become anxious about the future, I get thoughts, what if I get fired, what if then this that and I spiral but not for long periods of time, but it happens. I have frequent mood swings and normally I just got the bitch resting face.\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI don't really daydream much but when I do I don't pay attention to my surroundings and I just go \"uh?\" or \"sorry i spaced out\", I am not aware of my surroundings and even with simple tasks like taking out the trash I would keep going straight while I'm thinking and would have to remind myself that the garbage bin I skipped while I'm moving and I appear like an idiot.\n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI would look for a way to escape because I'm not staying in an empty room for more than an hour or so, I would get claustrophobic eventually and would instinctively attempt to break out on my own. Having no one to talk to or nothing to do is one the things I hate.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI consider all the possibilities of that option that I choose. It works kind of like the butterfly effect, like if I take option A1 it could lead to B1 then C1 then D1 and if I take option A2 it could lead to B1 C2 and something like that, I try to look for that option that correlates with what I want to achieve and more often than not I roll with it even though I'm never 100% sure about it. I do change my mind a lot since I might find a better option than the former later on.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI don't really understand my emotions and usually I feel like a robot because I don't get strong feelings at all. The emotional stances are like laughter, crying and the usual blank face. I find my emotions annoying and tend to ignore them and bottle them up whenever I can, until they explode on me.\n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNo, I don't see why I should agree with someone just to make them feel better. If I am 99% sure I am right about something and I've thought it in my head I wouldn't mind escalating it into a debate to see their POV, because there be a 1% chance that I could be wrong. I look for logical inconsistencies in people's points and arguments and I am quick to point them out, then they get upset.\n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't break rules often solely because I want to have a peaceful life, in fact being in jail is one of the things that I fear and I hope never happens to me. I would say authority as a whole is complex topic to talk about because society as we have it, can never be perfect no matter what the circumstances are. People will always abuse their power and there's always going to be people to break rules, and that's probably why life is fun in that sense, if everyone abided by the rules and people didn't abuse their power, the world would be dull. Some people would do go to the extremes to commit a crime, just to seem cool. On the other hand, some people get an authority position just to accumulate more wealth and just life off telling people lies. I have broken rules as well but it hasn't hurt anyone so it shouldn't be a big deal, though I don't break them often if at all, in reality.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.11314375}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.8555505}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.6361368}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -4.97991}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -5.158184}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -5.416067}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -6.409197}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.560026}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.2405434}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -7.820301}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.034203}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -8.3913}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -8.698641}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.974495}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -9.250656}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -9.414671}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.443563}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -9.592388}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -9.74192}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.809748}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.06740551}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -2.7306688}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.966274}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.117802}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.460947}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -14.724951}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -15.210241}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -15.41433}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -15.466512}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -15.46992}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -15.540721}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -15.565857}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -15.913751}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -15.937213}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -15.938396}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -15.950605}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -16.074139}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -16.152992}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -16.183352}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.214394}]}}
{"submission": "Been wondering for so long and yet when I think I'm one, I choose another, and the cycle repeats.\n\nI'll start off by giving a general description of myself\n\nGenerally I am perceived as quiet, and that is true.

When making a decision, I am generally focused on what is important and makes sense, rather than what will make others happy. I still try to do the right thing, but I focus more on what is in my opinion, the fairest answer, without being biased. Aside from that, as to the overthinking, I believe it is my skepticism towards everyone and everything. I usually come to assumptions of things that might happen and why it will happen.

What would your leadership style be?\n-I dont really like it because i dont like having responsabilites. And i dont really like helping people either. So i would probably not be good at it.

{"submission": "Hey everyone,\n\nAppreciate you all for sticking with this probably long post. Didn't share a photo since personally after constant research of the functions, typing off superficial appearance and quirks seems sort of irrational(no offense to those just having fun here).\n\nWhen I first tested as a teenager in high school, I scored an ENTP. Then in college I was an ISTP. Looking back in hindsight, that ISTP score was more male ego aspiration bias because it sounded cool and logical. In recent weeks when taking the test it came out INFP.\n\nWith better introspection, I realize that I used to low-key dread the idea of being a feeler. Society tends to not take people seriously that prioritize feeling based rationale, especially with sexist expectations of men being the cold logical ones. Now in my mid to late 20's, I've matured into appreciating taking feelings into account and seeing the differing ethical perspectives.\n\nThat said, not exactly sure if INFP would be correct either. I definitely have used Fe most of my life because I was the \"gentlemanly polite kid\" in my family often reading the room to act accordingly. In general, I hate social faux pas and rude drama, it makes me very uncomfortable, hence I morph myself to ensure the least amount of tension in varying contexts. That said, I will subtely change conversations or have people in my good graces so that I could control the flow to my preference. \n\nIronically, while I know to read the room and do enjoy theoretically empathizing with people's perspectives, I'm very very awkward when it comes to consoling grieving people. Hence my strategic mentality is to make sure everyone is content so I don't freeze up and look like an a-hole ineptly dealing with their raw emotional fallout. I like the idea of helping humanity, but being face to face with real humans with raw emotion is yeah... nope.\n\nOn the other hand, I also realize my \"logical persona\" I built for myself wasn't so logical. Yes it annoys me when people throw truth out the window in their arguments, but even I don't seek out logic for logic's sake. Usually I have some motivational daydream idea that inspires me to research information to better build my understanding of something. Obviously I want the truth and do refine my analytical research to reach that, but the initial spark was some illogical daydream. \n\nFor example, I studied History in university, the connection to humanity and the rigorous interpretive analysis drew me to the field. In contrast, sciences and technology bores me unless I could daydream about how it applied to humanity. \n\nAnother example is when I initially tried to apply for project manager positions at hospitals after graduation. My mind was excited about the idea of leading a team that contributed to society's health. But reality eventually hit that wait a minute, I hate checklists and micromanaging reports. I've managed teams before, but always laying out a broad picture set into general objectives, delegating to people and trusting they can complete goals using whatever means. I hate micromanaging, excel reports, and other minutiae.\n\nAnyway, I've probably meandered long enough. I'd appreciate any insight on this. I am much more accepting to the idea of being a feeler nowadays.\n\nHelp?", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.1642415}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.1249673}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -3.8533304}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.8056865}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.7070975}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.3687797}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -8.013531}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -9.145592}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.555649}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.591885}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.044304}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -10.318823}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.781498}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -10.935217}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -11.193184}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -11.587013}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -11.806631}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -11.944782}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.979794}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -12.189869}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0006079599}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.8588614}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -8.806405}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.466231}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.897317}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -10.93724}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.329623}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.762876}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -14.041957}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -14.312026}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.438991}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.874478}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -15.092582}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -15.491284}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -15.732738}, {"token": " F", "logprob": -16.06126}, {"token": "PF", "logprob": -16.165096}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -16.346617}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -16.612385}, {"token": "FF", "logprob": -16.651163}]}}

{"submission": "Help typing me\n\nHelp typing myself\r\n\r\nI've been kinda' obsessed with MBTI over the past few months. Really anything to do with personality tests or insights about myself usually intrigue me. \r\n\r\nI've been stuck on my type as 16 types to go back n' forth on is driving me nuts lmao. Gonna' write somethings about myself and see what you guys think.\r\n\r\nMy core values are:  Freedom, Authenticity, Open mindedness, Courage, Friends/Family. \r\n\r\nEven though I send a lot of time trying to 'find myself', I notice that in social situations, I'm different depending on the group. My parents for instance, see me as a quiet, to myself person that they never know what I'm thinking or feeling.\r\n\r\nMy friends on the other hand, see me as a bubbly, outgoing, weirdo who probably over shares and is always talking about something. \r\n\r\nTemper wise, I've always had loose control on my feelings. From when I was a child, the littlest things would set me off and I embarrassingly admit that being 23, things haven't gotten much better for me in that department. \r\n\r\nMy dream when I was younger and to this day is to be a professional wrestler/actor. I love the idea of playing a different role, story telling, and the added bonus of the crowd going crazy from you doing an insane move in the ring, lmao. \r\n\r\nMy biggest fear is that one day I'll wake up, and it'll be too late to do all the things I've wanted to. I guess I'm really afraid of letting fear rule my life. \r\n\r\nI'm a BIG procrastinator. I'll usually wait, wasting time on things I find enjoyable until the absolute last minute when I have to rush. \r\n\r\nQuotes/sayings that I resonate with the most are:\r\n\r\n\"Memento Mori\", which is a latin phrase that essentially means \"remember you must die\". It reminds us to live our lives with the thought in mind that every day could be our last.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is I love being alive. And I love feeling free. So if I can't have those things then I feel like a caged animal and I'd rather not be in a cage. I'd rather be dead.\" a quote by actress, Angelina Jolie. \r\n\r\nGoing more in depth about each point:\r\n\r\nFreedom/Authenticity - For me, freedom is the ability to do, say, dress, and be who you are without letting the opinions of society influence you in any way. I also see it as the mastery of fear, something that I've had trouble with for a while. I value it because i feel it's the most natural way for us as humans to live. When we're born, we only obtain anxiety and fear by noticing more and more things in society and having more expectations placed on us. While I don't wish to necessarily be free of obligations, i do wish to be mentally free in spite of them.\r\n\r\nCourage - Courage is a big deal for me because I'm always in my head about things. I feel if we just DO things, life would be a lot simpler. I want to get to a point where I focus on things I can control as opposed to things that I can't. \r\n\r\nFriends/Family - When im with people I'm comfortable with, i feel the most free and powerful. I thrive off the energy of being with and around people who accept me for who I am and want to make them feel as comfortable and heard as I am.\r\n\r\nDifferent around different people - A fear of rejection? I think I've come up with so many scenarios in my head about what people's reaction would be that if I'm not comfortable around you or feel you'd not accept me, I'd prefer to not say anything at all.\r\n\r\nTemperament - Mostly coming from things I can't do that I feel i should be good at either because they're simple, or I've spent enough time on them to be good at them. Maybe an ego thing? I've never liked losing or feeling like I'm not as good as someone. \r\n\r\nBe a different person - I think acting is a good outlet to experiment different parts of yourself while also getting to live out someone else's life. I think being the same person all the time is boring and I'd love to be a different gender or race if only for a week.\r\n\r\nCrowd - I love the rush I imagine you'd get from people either cheering, or boo'ing you. Being completely in the moment and having everyone hang on your every taunt and move, not knowing if you're gonna win or lose, seems like peak excitement and living to me.\r\n\r\nWorst fear - If a situation occurred, I'd probably spend my remaining time doing everything I can. Which is my fear. That it would take something life threatening to finally live fully.\r\n\r\nProcrastination - Truthfully, i can handle negative experiences as long as i feel it's worth it (working out, for instance), but when it's something i desperately don't wanna do, I'll find any reason not to.\r\n\r\nlive like it's your last - because at the end of the day, nothing matters and the thing your hung up on won't be important in the long run.\r\n\r\nI'm open to answering any follow up questions, thanks in advance to anyone who reads", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": "ENFP", "logprobs": {"EN": [{"token": "EN", "logprob": -0.071714245}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -4.1893635}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -4.2312927}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -4.2428303}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.2766533}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.6173973}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -5.8825703}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -6.8169975}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.875553}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -7.7287006}, {"token": "En", "logprob": -8.043293}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -8.193275}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -8.357164}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -8.366381}, {"token": " ES", "logprob": -8.602268}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.8001175}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -9.139318}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -9.404354}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.615881}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -9.67053}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.00048226974}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -7.981485}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -9.063406}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.933701}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -13.112417}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -13.2776985}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -13.734531}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -14.623613}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -15.093164}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -15.232206}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -15.530273}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -15.640772}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -15.677603}, {"token": "SP", "logprob": -16.113031}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -16.734911}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -17.066362}, {"token": "_FP", "logprob": -17.092726}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -17.690905}, {"token": "EP", "logprob": -17.987627}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -18.062412}]}}

So I'm posting this here in case someone could help me figure it out\n\nHere's a little info about me:\n\n\n**ENTJ traits**\n\n-I'm a natural leader and often the first one to take a stand for something \n\n-I can be pretty assertive and bossy in projects, but not in a negative way, I'm just a good coordinator and people generally listen to me and do great when I'm the one in charge\n\n-I'm pretty \"cold-hearted\" overall and not easily affected by sad stories and certain emotional things. I rarely cry at something that's not happening to me, or something where I'm not involved \n\n-I can be manipulative and machiavellian when it comes to achieving goals, using people, but only when it's absolutely necessary. Basically I sometimes manipulate people around me to do things for me, but that's where I draw the line, I'm not really like the stereotypical \"entj evil psychopath\" who sees people as pawns tho\n\n-I have a tendency to be in control of everything that happens in my life and can get pretty upset by setbacks. I value order and organization\n\n-I have a strong set of values that I never break, even tho I think of myself as a morally ambiguous person, there are certain things I deem unacceptable and would never do, and frown upon everybody who does it\n\n-I'm very success oriented, and one of my main goals is to be rich and high in the corporate world\n\n-This is very stereotypical, but I kinda have this internal obsession with power. I don't really behave like this, but I love being in position of giving orders, being the main member of the group, being the center of attention etc. etc. \n\n\n**ENFJ traits**\n\n-I am a very open and friendly person to everybody I meet, stranger or not and can empathize easily with everyone I talk with \n\n-I love solving people's problems in general, offering advice and sometimes going overboard with helping them, prioritizing them over myself\n\n-When it comes to friendships, I am always the therapist type of friend to everyone and everyone says I give the best advice \n\n-When it comes to love, I get attached very deeply and quite often fall in love with people that have \"issues\" or need \"fixing\" \n\n-I subconsciously \"alter\" my personality around people, think like the chameleon effect, and can fit in pretty much with any group\n\n-Even though I'm pretty success driven as I mentioned before, most of my goals in life involve relationships. I value friendships deeply and I'm always looking for \"that special someone\"\n\n-Even if I would call myself \"logical\", I kinda always follow my heart in the end when making decisions. I rarely actually do the logical and rational thing and always do what I feel like doing\n\n\n**Cognitive functions**\n\nI am definitely a Ni user, that's 100% but I can't figure out my dominant function. I think I have both Te and Fe pretty high, but I can't really figure out which one is my dominant one", "clean_guess": "ENFJ", "llm_guess": "ENFJ", "logprobs": {"EN": [{"token": "EN", "logprob": -0.21015197}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.5403407}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -3.6396449}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -3.8932498}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -4.0250764}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -4.1180806}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -4.616513}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -5.2525983}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.4696946}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -6.2389073}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -6.58598}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -6.793431}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.2380586}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -7.3025384}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.5525746}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -7.6750455}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -7.871104}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -8.156441}, {"token": "Both", "logprob": -8.255182}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -8.535679}], "F": [{"token": "F", "logprob": -0.00063213997}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.9661684}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -8.534886}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -9.744882}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.93954}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -12.899697}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -13.09773}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -13.305036}, {"token": " TJ", "logprob": -13.633187}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -14.530593}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -14.598393}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -14.872319}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -15.02881}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -15.0796995}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -15.306634}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -15.326737}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -15.60528}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -15.768034}, {"token": "NJ", "logprob": -16.191061}, {"token": "MJ", "logprob": -16.205462}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -4.9617593e-06}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.262153}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -13.9819765}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -14.99839}, {"token": "JI", "logprob": -15.074411}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -15.352599}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -15.807732}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -16.075586}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -16.42447}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -16.450092}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -16.457922}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -16.61586}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -16.705816}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -16.743856}, {"token": " or", "logprob": -16.834457}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -17.074705}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -17.476725}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -17.53924}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -17.5916}, {"token": "...", "logprob": -17.68228}]}}
{"submission": "Feeling like I lack the self-awareness to type myself properly, I hope some of you may be able to help me with that. I haven\u2018t been able to figure out my type at all. Cognitive functions tests typically indicate high Ti, Ne and Ni, got INTP quite frequently, but I don\u2018t want to be swayed by personal bias and would like someone more qualified to take a look at my answers from a purely objective standpoint.\n\nThanks in advance! :) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am 21 years old, female. Introverted, I love being on my own and get mentally drained rather easily. Zero friends here; I struggle with maintaining relationships mainly because I lose interest fairly quickly in - everything, really. But then, I can\u2018t say I\u2018ve met friends for life yet and haven\u2018t been fortunate with the people coming into my life. Other than that, I like reading, playing video games, researching about my latest hyperfixation\u2026 and I like being mentally stimulated.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNot that I know of. \n\n\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nSome slight religious influence, yes. I liked growing up and believing in something bigger than myself; I need purpose and meaning and my belief in an omnipotent being - God - helps with that. A lack of purpose has already led me to experience an existential crisis. It helps with my moral compass, too.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI\u2018d feel refreshed. \n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious, I\u2018d say. Sometimes it\u2018s a directionless kind of curiosity; I\u2018m curious for the sake of being curious, for the sake of learning, I suppose? Whether it\u2018s philosophic concepts, the anatomy of the human body, the human psyche or something as abstract as spirituality, too. Anything that I can possibly learn from, that can help me grow in whatever way, is something I\u2018m curious about.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nHonestly, I\u2018m not sure. I think I\u2018m lacking the self-awareness needed to answer this question. I\u2018m neither follower nor leader, I don\u2018t like leading and I don\u2018t like being led.\n\n\n \n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nTo a degree, maybe. I like writing poetry when the inspiration strikes me. My poetry\u2018s of the triste, melancholic kind. It\u2018s the only way of expressing myself, my way of being vulnerable, if you could say that. I don\u2018t like confiding in others, so when I feel like I need to vent or express emotional distress, I write it down in forms of tragic poetry but only when I feel compelled to do so. Other times, I simply keep to myself.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past, present and future\u2026 Sometimes it feels like they all exist simultaneously. I think a lot about all three. Pondering over what happened, thinking about what I could have changed or what could have been different if things went this or that way\u2026 Pointless questioning, but I can\u2018t help it.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI\u2018d feel obliged to help. Used to be a very anxious people pleaser back then, but I no longer feel like conforming to that past self of mine since I got taken advantage of. In the end it depends on what they\u2019re asking for. I don\u2018t mind doing small things here and there, but I don\u2018t want to be anyone\u2018s go-to person for whenever they\u2018ve got requests of any kind. It gives me that sense of duty, a responsibility I need to fulfill and I dislike responsibilities\u2026 But I\u2019m fine with small things, doing good deeds and all. I\u2018m not one to ask for help, but you never know when it\u2018s your turn to reach out your hand.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": "INFJ", "logprobs": {"INF": [{"token": "INF", "logprob": -0.34070188}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.8543317}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.3842256}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -3.6398351}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.9261093}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.306223}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -7.07469}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -9.271635}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.277306}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -9.481895}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.622446}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -9.833069}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.292637}, {"token": ".IN", "logprob": -10.701275}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -10.740753}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.877464}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.886066}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -11.000233}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.193825}, {"token": "Is", "logprob": -11.4070835}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -4.501419e-05}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -10.07194}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -14.293862}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -14.691176}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.424563}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.733762}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -16.055313}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -16.130922}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -16.146574}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -16.484262}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -16.648798}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -16.910603}, {"token": "(P", "logprob": -16.911827}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -17.024124}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -17.113632}, {"token": "(J", "logprob": -17.118103}, {"token": "(", "logprob": -17.134289}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -17.27021}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -17.466484}, {"token": "(T", "logprob": -17.536148}]}}
{"submission": "Help!! I\u2019m trying to figure out if I\u2019m an Fi-Te or a Ti-Fe and could use all the help I can get. Feel free to ask me extra questions!  \n\n\nFor me it\u2019s really hard to figure out, even if I\u2019ve taken multiple tests I can see either working. I have a tendency to score high Fi & Ti which doesn\u2019t help figuring out my mbti. I know sometimes high Fi can mirror Ti if it values it, which could be the case for me honestly. I\u2019ll add that my Te scores tend to go from low to non-existent & my Fe scores sit at a good medium low. If that makes any sense at all lol \n\nFi vs Fe \n\n* I struggle seeing my own traits in other people. \n* As a child I had PAGES of notes writing down my personality traits down on a page, not entirely sure why I did this, I think it may stem from the inherent feeling of being unsure if I even had a personality. Or does my complete unawareness of myself sometimes lower the credibility of having high Fi ? \n* Or maybe I don\u2019t notice my Fi because it\u2019s so second nature to me so I don\u2019t notice that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing?? But it could that I\u2019m just an a Ne dom bc Fi should probably know? Or does me thinking too hard about what I feel mean I\u2019m more Fi  ?!?!\n* I\u2019m not as authentic when speaking to or hanging out with others, there\u2019s always some kind of barrier no matter how close I am to someone that I simply cannot bring down no matter how hard I try and it\u2019s *exhausting*. I feel like I\u2019m performing and can\u2019t stop (tbf I\u2019m also neurodivergent)\n* I\u2019m a sucker for attention and entertaining others, I will purposefully do things to make people either laugh at what I\u2019m saying or laugh at me. \n* I crave to be original and unique, I eat \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc up \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc when people tell me they\u2018ve never met anyone like me, but at the same time loathe being misunderstood. \n\n  \nTi vs Te\n\n* I struggle to see the Te in me ever, even Te vs Ti questions have me stumped because I have no idea what I do, or if I do them at all.\n* Not sure if this relates, but I do this thing where I kind of **need** a rule of some kind to something, even if small, just so I understand the parameters\u2014 or if something doesn\u2019t have any written rules but has a pattern, I feel the need to vaguely follow that pattern or I feel I might do something wrong. \n*  I\u2019m also always very open to new ideas or concepts to expand my worldview, so I never see anything quite as set in stone.\n* Sometimes when I\u2019m watching or taking in something I don\u2019t form an opinion on it until I see the discourse in the comments and form my own opinion from that \n* or I\u2019ll see something, have a sudden opinion on it, then scavenge for a likeminded person in the comments \n* I know Te is described to be objective and I see myself as a pretty objective person, but I also notice I tend to inject subjectivity into my objectiveness.

I have no idea. \n* when explaining why I think the way I do I\u2019ll explain my interworkings or my values or logic behind anything I do or believe in, to explain myself and my viewpoint (could be Fi?)  \n", "clean_guess": "INFP.", "llm_guess": "INFP. \n\n", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.13722421}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.6068344}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.6526985}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -4.8040924}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -5.1701927}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -5.2318096}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.8849983}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.5478745}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.6877804}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.91741}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -8.101448}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -8.164318}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -8.243471}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.512905}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -8.54723}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -8.751097}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.965969}, {"token": "Fi", "logprob": -9.015625}, {"token": "Ti", "logprob": -9.133745}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -9.153795}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0010488853}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.241482}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -8.992653}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.9502125}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.246202}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -10.270418}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.649693}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.810623}, {"token": " CON", "logprob": -11.52479}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.0596695}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -12.605459}, {"token": "FORMATION", "logprob": -12.621054}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.715324}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -13.126696}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -13.169958}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.227427}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.256767}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.443617}, {"token": "CP", "logprob": -13.563084}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.784044}], ".": [{"token": ".", "logprob": -0.548836}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -0.876982}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -5.5037937}, {"token": " \n\n", "logprob": -7.3914614}, {"token": ".\n\n", "logprob": -7.5252333}, {"token": ",", "logprob": -7.7084227}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -8.404096}, {"token": " (", "logprob": -8.848128}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -9.255612}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -9.575097}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.131597}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -10.671088}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -11.242495}, {"token": ".\n", "logprob": -11.276881}, {"token": " with", "logprob": -11.795878}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -12.056854}, {"token": " or", "logprob": -12.113538}, {"token": "  \n\n", "logprob": -12.123104}, {"token": "\n\n\n", "logprob": -12.592472}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -13.141601}], " \n\n": [{"token": " \n\n", "logprob": -0.06556092}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -2.8712707}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -5.250118}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -7.2438197}, {"token": "  \n\n", "logprob": -8.023094}, {"token": " \n", "logprob": -8.102516}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -8.896248}, {"token": " Fi", "logprob": -10.64788}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.681875}, {"token": " Some", "logprob": -10.8673525}, {"token": " In", "logprob": -12.172699}, {"token": "  \n", "logprob": -12.242057}, {"token": " From", "logprob": -12.382459}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -12.948936}, {"token": " There", "logprob": -13.224785}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -13.266807}, {"token": " (", "logprob": -13.279724}, {"token": " Through", "logprob": -13.514247}, {"token": " Key", "logprob": -13.521485}, {"token": "   \n\n", "logprob": -13.672863}]}}

I do have an inclination towards a lot of activities I feel like people would associate with Se(snowboarding, skateboarding, rock climbing, hockey, etc.) however I feel like I\u2019m never fully present when doing these things it\u2019s like I\u2019m always deeply analyzing them for what they are.\n\n I\u2019m confused by this , is it possible I\u2019m just an entp with lower sensing functions or does anyone else have a different explanation?", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": "ENTP", "logprobs": {"ENT": [{"token": "ENT", "logprob": -0.27261645}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -1.497344}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -4.2768297}, {"token": "Ent", "logprob": -8.719289}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.346639}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -9.59109}, {"token": "ent", "logprob": -9.786733}, {"token": " ENT", "logprob": -9.923251}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -9.98368}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -9.99228}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.019837}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -10.148274}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.335969}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.362029}, {"token": "Possible", "logprob": -10.408679}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.552875}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -10.704078}, {"token": "Ex", "logprob": -10.936662}, {"token": "Poss", "logprob": -11.019174}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -11.185187}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -2.220075e-06}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.70042}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.56781}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -16.270615}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -16.283033}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.48481}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -16.75116}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -18.270784}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -18.399391}, {"token": "Per", "logprob": -18.408503}, {"token": "M", "logprob": -18.424664}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -18.43627}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -18.526983}, {"token": "W", "logprob": -18.541727}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -18.82543}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -18.95842}, {"token": "-P", "logprob": -19.31229}, {"token": "D", "logprob": -19.430273}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -19.627779}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -19.636732}]}}
{"submission": "Part 1/2\n\n-Intro-\n\nThe pinned post on this community by the Mods have probably the best questions I've seen as a typing guide, so thank you Mods. XD \n\nAlso, if you try to type me, thank you for giving your time~  Here's a virtual cookie from me:\n\n\ud83c\udf6a\n\nI'll give a virtual taco at the conclusion. \n\n-1-\n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n     28yo. Sex: female. Gender: non-binary. General description...uhhh. Asian. Give off a \"cute\" vibe, have been compared to an anime character on some occasions. No I'm not Japanese, I'm Filipina, but I grew up in Japan as a navy brat.\n\n-2-\n\nIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\n     Lol. XD  Depression, anxiety, c-PTSD. I'm taking Paxil, an SSRI that treats all three rather than just one.  \n\n-3-\n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\n     My dad does believe in god but has no religion. So long as it doesn't encroach on his way of life, he kind of allows my mom to enforce her beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. Being a JW means no celebration of holidays, including birthdays and Christmas, so that's how I grew up.\n\n     Personally, I am an agnostic atheist. I try to be respectful to the concept of religion, as I recognize its necessity in getting humans to where they are today. But I'm unable to feel \"connected\" to a higher being the way my mom does, nor do I find human creation via god as the \"only logical explanation\" the way my dad does.  \n\n-4-\n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n     I'm a nurse. I do love my job. I work at memory care and assisted living right now. I plan to go back to school to get my RN. And while I like making a difference in my residents' lives, giving them a reason to smile and making them feel safe in scary situations--what I really like is feeling competent and reliable.\n\n-5-\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n     Refreshed. I'm fine with spending time with others. I can be excitable and hyper, but in the end, its draining and I get to a point where I'm just acting excitable and hyper. Being alone, focusing on myself, doing what I want to do without worrying about others, is how I recharge my energy levels back to baseline.  \n\n-6-\n\nWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n     I like writing.  Whether it's stories, my thoughts on things, responses to others...writing. \n\n     I fkkn suck at sports, I cheated on my mile run in 1ST GRADE because I sucked so bad at it.  XD \n\n     As for other activities...mmn, reading webtoons/manga.  Reading/writing fanfiction. And listening to YouTube videos. Tibees, Kurzgesagt, Macdoesit, LittleKuriboh. Oh and yes, Frank James lol.  Things like that.  \n\n-7-\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n     Yes I'm curious about things. I love learning as much as I am capable of understanding on the subjects. Some of my curiosities include the fourth dimension (i.e. Klein bottles) or how we could all be living before the Great Filter, which morbidly amuses me.  \n\n     As for ideas, yes, I have many ideas when regarding stories I want to write. More than I can ever write. They are conceptual ideas. The genres my ideas revolve around are romance and soft sci-fi. For soft sci-fi, I define that as stories along a similar vein of Everything, Everywhere, All At Once (my all time fave movie).\n\n-8-\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n     Would I enjoy? In the larger scheme of things, yes, because I like the thought of guiding individuals into being a cohesive unit while preserving their strengths, then using that to accomplish a project or mission.\n\n     Do I think I'd be good at it?  I think I'd try every day, as a leader, to be a good one unless the team requires something I cannot provide. \n\n     My leadership style?  If I were to choose one, it's most likely be Democratic under the Goleman leadership styles.\n\n-9-\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n     Like...motor gross skills and hand eye coordination?  Pfft I suck at both, esp hand eye coordination. I can be good with free or interpretive body movement.  But coordinated movements found in gaming or sports does not come naturally to me.\n\n     As for working with my hands...mmn, yes I enjoy it, but only to learn about what I'm working on or to feel accomplished upon succeeding. All in all, it's satisfying to know I was able to succeed in tasks at intermediate and above levels. Think putting in an IV line or debriding a pressure ulcer.  \n\n-10-\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n     Nope!  I can draw basic stuff, like eyes or Gudetama (after practice and careful line-arting). I can appreciate art and I'm good at interpreting it, but it doesn't really fill me with deep feelings like say...a meaningful story or seeing a sunrise.  Even for comics or webtoons, I'd choose a meaningful story with mediocre art over a bland story with amazing art quality.\n\n-11-\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n     They are all equally important because, altogether, they create the concept of time. One cannot exist without the other. I deal with the past by ruminating on it, the present by taking it day by day, and the future by applying optimistic nihilism.  \n\n-12-\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n     I fkkn say yes because I'm a people-pleasing pushover. If I decide to help them, it's because 1) I feel bad and want to avoid feeling guilty, 2) I want to feel like I'm competent in something, or 3) It's something they don't ask for often, so I'm willing to do it one or two times before I put my foot down, feeling guilty all the while. \n\n-13-\n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n     I don't necessarily need it, but yes, that would be nice. I can get discouraged and apathetic if things remains inconsistent. Because then people do what they want and leave others to clean up the mess. So, I'll still do what I need to do but the longer such unreliability goes on, the more burnt out I'll be. \n\n     HOWEVER.  I become discouraged and frustrated if things become too logical. For example, paperwork that takes up half of my shift. Even when I understand the reasoning for it, I resent having to do so much of it or I'll lose my job. So, rather than the act of it, the underlying reason for it leads me to feeling burnt out.

{"submission": "I am definitely an emotional person, I can\u2019t say that I am not. I am that sort of a person that cries during movies or whenever somebody says something touching. I definitely feel my feeling ten times more than the average person. I love anything that can emotionally move me, any sort of art, music or literature. \n\nAt the same time I would not say I make decisions based on my emotions or that I am ruled by my heart. As contrasting as it sounds I am almost an obsessive researcher and I search for valid information and logical consistency in everything in my life. I hesitate to make any sort of a decision unless I feel like collected a valid number of unbiased objective data. I love to analyse this data and even discuss it in various intellectual arguments and disputes. I very much enjoy philosophical, intellectual debates where I can use all my knowledge and in such debates I can be very argumentative and I can put my emotions completely aside. \n\nI am interested in politics, philosophy, history or psychology and I can spend days researching these topics, remembering various data about it and using debates with other people as a tool of learning something new. But at the same time, I have to admit, all of my fields of interest are very human based. I like to learn about people, how they think, what motivates them throughout time and space and I am keen to learn to understand the human nature. \n\nI am a little too emotional when it comes to dealing with my own internal world. I am naturally introverted and very self analysing. I need to spend a lot of time alone to try and understand who I am, what drives me, what motivates, what makes me feel the way I feel. I have to admit that these introverted musings often lead me to rather melancholic states of mind. However, I don\u2019t see melancholy itself as anything bad, it often inspired me to think deeply about life, existence, the meaning of it all. These thoughts also often inspire me to be creative, to write poetry, lyrics, compose music or to come up with a fictional story. I often daydream and imagine myself in various scenarios. My biggest issue is that sometimes I get so lost in my musings and daydreams that I lose touch with the reality. I also often struggle with feeling excited about my work and my ideas at first but I lose interest pretty quickly, I tend to not finish what I start. \n\nAs a person who is very influenced by my internal ideas and internal ideals, I find it difficult to deal with the imperfection of reality and even myself. I am a perfectionist in a sense that I have an inner ideal of everything from the outside world to my own self and I try to get as close to this ideal as possible. This comes with quite a strict approach to certain things in my life from my diet, body, fashion and style to the books I read, tone of voice I use, information I try to learn and so on. I am hard on myself and I hate to feel like I am wasting my potential. I strive to become the most perfect the most ideal version of myself and that requires a lot of hard work that I am willing to do.\n\nSince there are many areas in my life I want to be perfect in, I tend to have many various hobbies and interests outside of work. I barely let myself just relax, there\u2019s always something I work on. I have various artistic, musical and literally projects that I work on as well as journalistic projects I work on every day.\n\nI love the adrenaline of a busy lifestyle and I need a bit of stress in my life to feel full-filled. Sitting at home, taking care of family would be a death of me. I love to have a busy to-do lists everyday, I am goal oriented and task driven. \n\nI am definitely not a natural leader and I like to think of myself as an independent worker but I often see that other people around me are much less driven and ambitious than I am. That is why I often find myself giving orders to others and naturally lead small teams, since usually I am the most ambitious one.

{"submission": "Used to be fairly well-versed in typology but it has been a while. Humor me?\n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am nineteen years old, male, and very tired. Physically, quite average, I think. Slightly scraggly, unkempt at times, but able to put in the effort to look decent when needed. I have a hard time describing myself, honestly. Been a little out of touch in that realm as of late. My apologies.\n\nIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nDPDR and MDD, the depersonalization being the most pressing issue at the moment. Working on it, though. Could be better, could be worse.\n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI was raised Mormon, eldest of ten children. I mentally left the church when I was fourteen, due to the logical fallacies and the dissociation that followed after my shelf broke. I was able to physically leave once I moved out at seventeen, though. Religion caused quite a bit of tension between my parents and I. I am by no means an aggressive or antagonistic person, just inquisitive, is all. Questioning is often not welcome in religious spheres, though. Doubt is like a poison, or a seed, if you will. I remember them saying something of the sort.\n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI have been working labor intensive odd jobs for the past year and a half. I plan on getting a much more consistent job soon, though. It depends on what I am tasked with, I suppose. Some are much more enjoyable than others. The pay varies as well. I do not like how inconsistent it is; the unnecessary confusion and stress takes a toll on my work ethic.\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nGood God, I could go for one of those. I would kill for a weekend to myself. I feel as if I am a better and more bearable person when I am alone. Sometimes I do miss the company of other human beings, but I realize that it is only in theory and not in practice. Some alone time is exactly what I need, though.\n\nWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI enjoy working with my hands, along with activities that have an end goal of sorts. Sports-wise I am actually fairly proficient when it comes to rollerblading. I also enjoy playing the odd basketball game and hiking. I take the most pleasure in cooking, fishing, gardening, and reading, though.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI like to think that I am fairly curious. I certainly do not shy away from anything that involves learning more about a particular subject. I have quite a few ideas that will appear in my head that I immediately shut down due to the inability to execute them. I suppose that I do not entertain too many impractical ideas and attempt to only acknowledge the realistic ones. I am curious about most things. I can usually think of quite a few questions for whatever subject I may be thinking about or observing presently. Usually my ideas tend to be biased towards my own personal areas of expertise or interest. I can often tie them back to a subject I am passionate about and go from there. I would say that my ideas have the potential to be both conceptual and environmental, it just happens to depend on the situation.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nMost likely, no. I do not want to be tasked with the responsibility of caring for others along with their needs, especially in a professional environment. I can barely follow, I certainly shouldn\u2019t be leading. If I absolutely had to for the sake of humanity or something of the sort, sure, maybe, but I would most likely take a delegative approach.\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI believe so? I am somewhat aware of my surroundings. I do enjoy working with my hands and I do appreciate the grounding aspect that comes with it. I cook quite often which allows me to blow off some steam. I also pin insect specimens which requires both patience and precision. I find that to be very enjoyable and relaxing. Additionally, I also keep tarantulas and the maintenance that comes alongside that comes with a decent amount of handiwork. Aside from those I also partake in building, fishing, gardening, manual labor, and woodworking.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forms of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nTo an extent. I am able to recognize what is visually pleasing to me and that also applies to others at times. I used to draw quite a bit in my youth but gradually lost interest the more my hobby was criticized. I am decent at realism, but I do not have much luck in the free-handing realm. I can appreciate lovely architecture, music, literature, painting and sculptures. No particular reason for those, simply just enjoyable to me.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI am the most out of touch with the present. When deep in thought I find myself either ruminating the past or contemplating the future. Sometimes I have to beg myself to participate in the present. It is similar to trudging through a swamp; not nearly as fluid or seemingly simple to me as wading through the past and future. To experience the present for a brief period of time I typically need to use substances.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI suppose it depends on the person and the task. I would be willing to help most people, I think, especially if it is a simple request. If someone is perfectly capable of doing it themselves and it is more-so a request out of pure laziness, I most likely would not assist them.\n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIt is preferred but that seems somewhat unattainable. I find myself relating to this quote from The Brothers Karamazov: \u201cI have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic.\u201d I do love logical consistency but is man a purely logical being? I wouldn\u2019t think so. I am somewhat grateful for that, though.\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nEfficiency is quite important to me. Saves me quite a bit of time and energy which is very helpful. Productivity is also fairly important, but less than efficiency, I think. I think the definition of productivity varies from person to person. One man may consider thinking to be productive while the other does not since it does not yield a physical product or response in the process. Is taking part in this questionnaire productive? It may be, if I receive answers, I suppose. It certainly depends.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI try not to. I do not like to meddle in the affairs of others. Sometimes I will offer my advice or input to those who are important to me, but I always add a disclaimer of sorts stating that I do not want to influence their decision. I have no reason to control others, that just seems rather strange. I am only in control of myself and my own actions, no need to add more to my plate.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nCooking, pinning insects, playing video games, reading, researching, and tarantula keeping are the main ones. I taught myself how to cook a year or so ago because I wanted to be more resourceful and self-sufficient. I also just happen to love good food. I began pinning insects to help further my experience and knowledge surrounding entomology since the subject is rather important to me. For video games I enjoy the Soulsborne genre more than anything. It is an enjoyable and somewhat relaxing way to blow off some steam. Reading and researching are in the same vein, I think. I mostly read the classics, philosophy, and science oriented texts. Research-wise my favorite subjects are entomology, marine biology, philosophy, and religion. Last but not least, tarantula keeping. I have been keeping tarantulas for four years. This has operated as a salvation of sorts, an out, if you will. I am not sure why it carries such a heavy importance to me. They are fascinating and wonderful creatures. It is difficult for me to elaborate much on the subject from a hobby stance but it is deeply personal to me.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI believe the learning style that benefits me the most is reading and writing. Kinesthetic and visual approaches are also helpful at times. I have an extremely difficult time with auditory based learning. I do not absorb much of anything in the process and often end up more confused than anything. Classes containing any of the approaches listed above sound lovely. I will not limit myself solely because I struggle in a certain area.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI believe I am adequate at strategizing. I used to take the improvisation route when I was a student since school was not very important to me. Now that I am older and somewhat wiser, I attempt to break down projects into smaller tasks when completing them. Creates a much more thorough and successful end product as well.\n\nWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI did want to become an entomologist but I do not have the time or the money to do so. Professionally I am just hoping for financial and mental stability. Nothing too out of the ordinary, I would just like to survive and be somewhat content. Personally, I would like to be a father. Settling down with a wife somewhere in the countryside sounds lovely. Maybe adopt a couple kids if that is something we felt we were capable of doing. Support my family, live a comfortable and modest life, tend to my hobbies, all that good stuff. Grow into a more humble and wiser person through the motions of life. Hopefully, y\u2019know.\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nIt is slightly difficult to put this answer into words but I will attempt. I fear incompetency and loss more than anything, I think. Being out of control of my responses is also humiliating. I am a fairly disciplined person so I attempt to keep to myself, especially in the emotional realm. It is difficult to explain why as well. It feels very deeply ingrained in me, it is almost as if I do not have an exact answer. Part of my character, I suppose.\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nAt my height I was entirely self-sufficient and able to maintain a consistent and steady routine. I was emotionally well, sober, and overall very content. It was nice. I had the time to appreciate the things around me. I was also much more grounded and present, I think. At peace with myself, I suppose.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nCurrently experiencing one of these, unfortunately. I turn to harmful habits to cope and have a tendency to shut others out. Become rather quiet and unapproachable in the process. I do not take very good care of myself and end up disregarding my safety. My well being gradually declines for quite some time until circumstances change.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nCertainly wouldn\u2019t say that I am extremely attached. I get lost in thought very, very often. I will pay attention to my surroundings when absolutely necessary, but even then, I struggle to do so.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nWould most likely begin by thinking about the absurdity of my situation along with the general surroundings and going from there. May have a few thoughts about my physical condition if I happened to be cold, hungry, tired, etc. I would most likely end up thinking about events that have occurred during my lifetime, regrets, philosophical ideas I have entertained, tarantulas, anything that frequently occupies my mind on a regular basis.\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt usually takes me quite a bit of time unless I have thought about it before. An entirely unexpected decision may take me anywhere from a day to a couple weeks to decide on. Decisions I have already taken into consideration usually only require an additional few hours for me to confirm. I do not find myself changing my mind often, especially if the decision has already been made.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI am not sure if I have ever fully processed my emotions. They should hold more importance to me, I think that would absolutely benefit me. I am so incredibly out of touch with them, though. I can never pinpoint how I am feeling outside of the physical sensation that follows. Because of this I have a difficult time connecting with others on an emotional level. I am not even sure where to begin to cope with it.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nDepends on the person. I feel as if it is rude to pretend to be interested when you are not, though. I remain indifferent in most cases, but I will listen to what someone has to say even if I do not agree with them. I would agree with someone if disagreeing would cause a greater issue, though. If agreeing with someone spares me some trouble I may occasionally take that route.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI do not break many rules but I do not abide by many rules, either. If there is an atrocious concept or rule presented to me, I may challenge it. I often will not outright challenge authority, though. I often do not care enough to do so. I would rather mind my own business, especially if it is not harming me personally.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who read this far.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.4389645}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -1.9007775}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -2.0546565}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -3.0460906}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -4.5288863}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -4.5309806}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -5.837829}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.515882}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.7882724}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.0246387}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -8.0420685}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.253622}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.284416}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.506601}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -8.942873}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -9.230919}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -9.537952}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -9.599979}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.610992}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -9.694311}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.22262023}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -1.611624}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.653147}, {"token": "RO", "logprob": -12.19813}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -13.628}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.701534}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.433369}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -15.295624}, {"token": "RODUCTION", "logprob": -15.4911995}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -15.568544}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -16.288416}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -16.844614}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -16.873009}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -16.967033}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -17.070631}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -17.147013}, {"token": "PJ", "logprob": -17.153051}, {"token": "ERRUPT", "logprob": -17.2751}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -17.284317}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -17.382446}]}}
{"submission": "I need some different perspectives on what you think my type is:\n\nthe first time I did the 16p test I got entj, even though I am pretty certain that's not my actual type as I was 17 and going through some sort of phase where I had a hyperfixation on wanting to study economics and figure out how the \"market\" works. Also I didn't know shit about cognitive functions. I don't think Te is my dominant function, I have pretty good leadership abilities and it's something I definitely enjoy from time to time but at the end of the day I couldn't care less about leading other people towards a common goal or even strive for efficiency. I am also profoundly catastrophic when it comes to organisational matters and time management skills.\n\nAfter I did a multitude of different cognitive functions test and also researching the functions I came to the conclusion that I am an Entp. Here are a few random facts about me and my approach to life:\n\n\\-I have to admit I am very unreliable. Not something I do on purpose I just forget whenever I promised to do something and I have to constantly remind myself of doing a certain task in order to actually execute it\n\n\\-I have been diagnosed with ADHD last year. I also did notice a few depressive tendencies and I feel very withdrawn whenever I lose inspiration or some sort of purpose\n\n\\-I am very interested in philosophy, psychology, mathematics and science, did study philosophy for a year and currently doing my bachelors degree in psychology and planning on doing my masters degree in forensic psychgoly\n\n\\-I want to help people and fairness is very important to me, however I am not the best at giving emotional support as I prefer a more rational approach\n\n\\-I am extremely good at problem solving; finding out the cause of a problem and logically deducting how it can be fixed, i am also extremely idealistic and sometimes think of solutions that are not directly tied to a conventional, realistic approach\n\n\\-Interestingly I am very bad with showing or understanding emotions, I feel very confused when people around me expect me to \"get\" how they are feeling, I simply can't do it, I need people people to tell me how they feel in order to understand it fully, it can also be applied for myself; I tend to rationalize my feelings, most of the time I feel like I don't even have access to them, the only time I can ever actually \"feel\" them is when I can create some kind of outlet, which takes a lot of focus and doesn't come naturally to me.\n\n\\-i have huge trust issues, my last relationship was over two years ago and extremely unfulfilling which is probably due to my inability to open up completely, I am working on it tho\n\n\\-I wanted to be an actress when I was younger, as I always had a fascination for taking on a different persona or role \n\n\\-I have always been extremely curious about the world, always asking why things are the way they are, why systems work the way they do, always wanting to find correlations between systems and patterns, I am very curious about people too, but even in that department I would say a more rational approach comes easier to me.\n\n\\-I am very creative and have a vivid imagination, I have a degree in graphic design and video editing, which I always enjoyed very much, I also always come up with some sort of scenario or even full on music video when I am listening to music\n\n\\-I love the outdoors, I love to travel and learn about different cultures, ways of living, expading my viewpoint of the world and tap into something completely unknown\n\n\\-I see my life as a sequence of specific concepts of things, rarely seeing the things for what they \"are\"\n\n\\-I have sudden realizations about how I felt in a situation that is months, sometimes years ago, I am completely unaware of it as it happens, leading to me putting myself in very uncomfortable situations but failing to realize how I feel due to complete unawareness of my own emotional state (Fi blindspot?)\n\n\\-I have been told I come off as emotionless, mischievous and like I \"don't give a fuck about anything\" (which is not necessarily true but I do understand why people could assume something like that)\n\n\\-I was shy when I was a child, but that quickly improved when I learned to trust my own perspective on things, kind of the opposite now\n\n\\-I grew up in a very guarded household, my mom kind of projected her own insecurities onto me due to her necessities never being fully fulfilled as a kid which led to her being very anxious and always wanting to give me everything she could, this led to me having no understanding of boundaries and also a feeling of having to grow up very fast as my mom would always panic when I came to her with a problem, I used to be very angry at her because of this but I am learning to meet her with a lot more empathy and understanding\n\n\\-I always struggled with authorities, especially in school, critizised their way of teaching, always wanting to do things my own way, skipped class a lot, was a very \"wild\" and argumentative kid you could say, couldn't resist a possibility to feel some kind of thrill\n\n\\-I am a walking contradiction, having a god complex and inferiority complex at the same time\n\n\\-I do have a lot of anger issues, which I did leave out on people even though it wasn't their fault, this could be due to repressed emotion (could also just be trauma or my mental health in general, idk if this has to correlate with mbti at all)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that I vented all my confusion and emotional turmoil onto you, please feel free to (try to) type me :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": "ENTP", "logprobs":

It\u2019s mostly picking up the little details of what\u2019s different from their usual self. And I feel their emotion, but also in a more detached way. I\u2019d say more sympathy than empathy. \n\nLike I could pick up that they\u2019re feeling down and feel compelled to cheer them up, frustrated if my attempts are dismissed. I won\u2019t force them to be happy when they\u2019re clearly going through something, but I feel troubled for them. \n\nI can also somewhat sense the atmosphere given that it is a familiar setting. Again, just picking up what feels off through cues like someone\u2019s tone. \n\nWith all this, I don\u2019t really feel it deeply. I\u2019m not moved, or at least not as much.

I know INFPs are intellectuals just as much as INTPs, and I\u2019m wondering whether my comprehension of all these ideas just comes from Ne. \n\nAnyway, fuck I\u2019m sorry if this sounds pretentious haha\u2026 \n\nAny help, would be appreciated :)", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.07502236}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.1861713}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -3.9092815}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -5.494166}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.0282483}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -6.329869}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.013224}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.716706}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -8.187764}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.635636}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.022403}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.34578}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -9.680135}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -9.784741}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -10.03021}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -10.155942}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -10.353387}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -10.369954}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -10.429055}, {"token": "NT", "logprob": -10.467963}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.00079330517}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -7.156828}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.196972}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.389572}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -13.50769}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -13.913612}, {"token": "UIT", "logprob": -15.367369}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -15.512733}, {"token": "uitive", "logprob": -15.930557}, {"token": "U", "logprob": -16.058075}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -16.296434}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -16.34684}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -16.473902}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -16.622437}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.715881}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -16.747139}, {"token": "_P", "logprob": -16.885475}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -16.960949}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -17.093761}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -17.259115}]}}
{"submission": "So basically, I am confused. I often type as ENFP and INTP and INFP in online tests but I don't exactly match any of the descriptions too well, to my understanding. So, here goes...\n\nI am 24 years old. I'm a male. Since I was small, I've had anxiety issues and currently have ocd, ptsd and gad.\n\nI come from a religious background but sometimes have my doubts. It's when I have these doubts that I actually find myself more grounded in worldly matters.\nI was fairly good at sports, but definitely not above average in any regard. It takes me quite some time to learn a repeated motion like a simple keep-up technique in football. Besides that, I've always been good with my hands. I can sketch and draw pretty darn well. I like having a general idea but I dislike being forced into a \"mould\" when working on something creative.\nAs a kid I've had a lot of forgetful episodes where I wouldn't do my homework and sometimes even forget my jacket, bag or shoes somewhere in school. I used to be a bit more social before, although over the years I've become more of a bedroom cav-dweller. I only have a dozen friends thati call close, and I only ever hang with5-6 of them. I do very well in mathematics and computer science. As a matter of fact, I taught myself computer science in my final year at high school (scored perfect). However, I often get overwhelmed by things I perceive as too hard. I do like stricture because it gives my a stencil to trace on instead of having me sit down and look for a solution for hours.\nI'm seemingly hardworking in school and uni and for personal projects but not at home... for most of my school years, I was driven by competition. Wanted to beat my rival (he's only my rival in my head).\n\nI used to be known as somewhat of a slob (Spiderman reference). I never really cared much for physical appearances or dating or even physical hygiene at times. As a 12 year old I would actually go days without showering sometimes. Obviously this all changed after a while. Though I still neglected my hairstyle, cutting my nails consistently etc... pls don't be grossed out, I was a kid. \n\nI've been described as somebody who is intelligent, possesses immense general knowledge, pensive, \"the smartest and dumbest person i know\", \"a goof\", \"indecisive\", quick thinking, attentive and naturally gifted. Im also known to be quite honest and lack filter. Shamefully, I even tell my mom whenever I spot a lie in her words, or if the food ain't good today (sorry mom, ily). I have some anger issues due to how life gets. People always do label .e as sharp or intelligent, even though I do think of myself as rather dumb.\n\nOver the years I've gotten more accustomed to working out, meditating and searching for good hobbies. I used to quit and go back to playing a few toxic games for years btw. Kind of weird.im not the best at reading people, though I can tell right from wrong well enough.\nI generally feel introverted but I don't have any trouble making conversation with anyone (except girls, though im improving).\n\nI like memes and good music, but not too many memes. After a while it just feels weird to see opium birds 24/7. \n\nI tried a computing course before, but due to mental issues and the terrible quality of the institution I attended, I dropped it to pursue something else.\n\nI'm currently doing economics elsewhere.\n\nMy hobbies include: collecting earphones, exercising, walking, eating good stuff, reminiscing, listening to music, watching anime and shows and all that (but not anything mainstream), watching football, thinking up stuff, overthinking, doing the bare minimum for school, being goofy\n\nI dislike: noisy people, fake people, entitled people, liars, mosquitoes, people that don't think for themselves, social norms that people mindlessly obey, crappy fashion, people that think they're better than everyone else, untidiness, pointless waste, unfinished stories and facts, reading, trends (fortnite 2018 ew), mean people, being told to do things (I'm too busy doing nothing), pretentiousness \n\nI like: people that understand, cuddling, noodles, toys, walking, being left alone, having what I learn translate into real life results, good nostalgic feelings, sunset viewed from a window at an angle, dragon ball z and other badass anime, my own dumb fantasies \n\nThanks for reading, if you made it this far!", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.8544973}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -1.033914}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -2.2019877}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -3.0314631}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -3.49431}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -4.170463}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -4.87116}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -5.9527373}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.5813327}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.5681624}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.889787}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.264512}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -8.408586}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -8.852225}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -9.028438}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -9.0494585}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -9.119828}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -9.280623}, {"token": "Poss", "logprob": -9.87511}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -9.999583}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.00027659023}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -8.227188}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.191929}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.85881}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -14.874388}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -15.208881}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -15.572073}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -15.820774}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -15.928516}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.174185}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -16.757492}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -17.218578}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -17.53373}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -17.680485}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -18.023085}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -18.0338}, {"token": "PX", "logprob": -18.106768}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -18.13203}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -18.236574}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -18.24035}]}}

{"submission": " \n\nQ. How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nA. I\u2019m 17, male. Hmmm\u2026 I\u2019d say I\u2019m relatively self aware, but it\u2019s something I always assumed everyone had if I\u2019m honest. I\u2019m aware of my position in life, but I\u2019ve just come to accept it and observe it in a way, I thought everyone was like this, aware and cohesive, having a formed worldview\u2026 but just not bothered to do anything about it physically. I feel like a lot of my life revolves around ideas and thoughts, cyclical patterns that I pick up, I mean, I\u2019m so lazy\u2026 like, I don\u2019t often read or watch videos to learn new information, but when I do? I become that much more confident, every step feels better when I walk outside, everything I observe perviates into my mind as this amalgamation of other things that bare similar attributes to it\u2026 that\u2019s the best way I can describe it, lmao\u2026 sounds pretentious af, I know; like those philosophers that explain everything in the most complex and sophisticated way possible to describe their ideas, but yknow, maybe they\u2019re onto something? Maybe it is the most freeing way to describe things? Or maybe it\u2019s just an aesthetic appeal\u2026 idk.\n\nQ. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nA. I\u2019m really not sure I have much to say in this department. It was very normal, aside from my parents rather rocky divorce when I was around 10-11; I\u2019m sure it had an effect on me, and if I went to see a psychologist I\u2019m sure they\u2019d say it has inflicted deep wounds or whatever\u2026 but, I think more or less I\u2019ve gotten over it after realising how little it truly matters to me that they love each other.\n\nQ. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nA. I\u2019m in college, studying sociology, English literature and Film. It\u2019s fine\u2026 I wanted to do physics, but I only found my \u201clove\u201d - I\u2019m not even sure if I do love it, at least not for what it is\u2026 if I loved it surely I\u2019d be digging into it constantly? But knowledge scares me, because it reminds me of my lack of it. Then again, physics is especially the subject that gives me that sense of \u201cwholeness\u201d that I described earlier. But yeah, I couldn\u2019t do physics since I didn\u2019t get a high enough grade. Just because I didn\u2019t really try on my exams\u2026 I didn\u2019t like physics back then: Newtonian mechanics, that kind of stuff is very boring to me. I did pass though\u2026 I passed all my subjects, god knows how\u2026\n\nQ. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nA. Idk if I\u2019d feel refreshed\u2026 this one is difficult to answer if I\u2019m honest. I find that when I\u2019m alone, I don\u2019t expend any energy but unless I\u2019m doing something I love - which is basically only physics haha, it scares me, the prospect of learning it and not being able to comprehend some of the material, so I just avoid it\u2026 but I really do like it when I get it\u2026 sometimes I just get it intuitively though? Like, if you asked me to step-by-step explain special relativity, I doubt I could without gathering my thoughts for awhile, but I understand the beauty of it so perfectly.\n\nQ. What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\nA. Idk\u2026 I\u2019m not too bothered about the physical world, although that\u2019s kind of a lie, I can binge sometimes on food\u2026 and I love eating the same chocolate bar over and over while I do something, but I also have this disdain almost for those that are fixated on it - my mom for example, although I love her to death, she\u2019s far too focused on the physical world to not annoy me a little bit.\n\nQ. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nA. I\u2019m not sure\u2026 kind of curious? I can become so fixated though sometimes. I\u2019m not curious with things that don\u2019t interest me: like I was playing Elden Ring, and in that game I took such little time to explore; I\u2019ve found this is a pattern with story games where I\u2019m given my mission and I kind of just want to reach it\u2026 but then I\u2019ll replay the game over and over again to try out different builds and play styles\u2026 but I just LOVE seeing my character develop from having \u201cmeh\u201d gear to almighty and powerful gear. Those are my favourite kinds of games, I just love that development\u2026\n\nQ. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nA. No, haha\u2026 I\u2019d be pretty bad at it, but again it all depends I suppose. I doubt I\u2019d be very good at it, probably lead everyone to their deaths, lmao.\n\nQ. Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nA. Probably not? It\u2019s hard to say\u2026 I have moments of coordination, like I went out with my friends, kicked a ball about and if I\u2019m really in the mood, I can enjoy it\u2026 most of the time I\u2019m too lethargic and distracted to pay attention to anything that\u2019s going on though.\n\nQ. Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nA. Yeah, yeah I am. Art is a very strange thing to me, because part of me hates it and part of me loves it. It\u2019s this constant expression of the same thing that every human feels, yet also every human feels the needs to spill their guts when many before them - with the exact same feelings - have spilled their guts in just the same way. Art reminds me of the complete and utter repetition of this world; how nothing ever truly advances. It\u2019s like school, it\u2019s like weddings, it\u2019s like childbirth\u2026 it\u2019s all just over and over and over and over, constantly turning. And I mean, art expresses this perfectly\u2026 and there\u2019s beauty behind it, behind accepting one\u2019s position as a speck, a cog, a futile marriage that alters no one\u2019s life but yours\u2026 there is a certain beauty about that, but fuck it\u2019s depressing seeing someone scream about how much they love someone, and knowing how pointless their love is. I have a certain anger towards the world in that sense; I\u2019m just thrust into this chasm where no one can ever mean anything. But I think art portrays that anger perfectly. I\u2019ve always said that I love the idea of reaming at something, and then projecting that passion into acceptance\u2026 from one force of will, with the exact same passion exalting all of that force into the cause that you were fighting for, after realising it\u2019s futility. Okay this was a long one\u2026 damn\u2026 I\u2019m so long-winded, I think I\u2019ll just answer the most important ones from now on - or at least just give shorter answers.\n\nQ. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know how much I think about either if I\u2019m honest, I think about the future more than the past though, I\u2019d say. But I\u2019m definitely not neglectful of the past, you can learn a lot from it.\n\nQ. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nA. I\u2019d be inclined to help them sometimes\u2026 but like\u2026 for example: when I was in Highschool, my friends would knock on for me sometimes, asking me to come out. And oftentimes I would, but I\u2019d say no, just out of some kind of spite I suppose? I\u2019d want to go out, but I\u2019d say no, to become some kind of disruptive force I suppose?\n\nQ. Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nA. Sure.\n\nQ. How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nA. Kind of important, but it comes in so many forms\u2026 I don\u2019t think my perception of productivity is the same as some business man, for example.\n\nQ. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nA. Guitar and writing mostly; I like them because they allow me to be creative and express certain paradoxes and observations I\u2019ve made - although, I rarely ever write, because I\u2019m always learning something new, so when I start writing, I\u2019ll learn something new since I started and it\u2019ll make me want to start again, so it\u2019s impossible to finish anything.\n\nQ. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nA. Reading\u2026 although I can honestly have a lot of trouble following trains of thought that aren\u2019t my own; maybe others are just shit at explaining things, or maybe I\u2019m just a shit listener.\n\nQ. What's important to you and why?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m honest\u2026 :/\n\nQ. What are your aspirations?\n\nA. Not sure\u2026 to be a writer? Even then, I\u2019m not really sure how much I care about being successful\u2026\n\nQ. What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nA. Many things\u2026 ummmm, pfftttt, being useless? Being insignificant. Those are probably my most prominent fears - it\u2019s kind of why I can distance myself from the world at times, and act like it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nQ. What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nA. VERY high.\n\nQ. What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nA. VERY low.\n\nQ. Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nA. All sorts of things, but they\u2019ll most likely be related to the darkness of the room, idk I\u2019ll probably try find some symbolic meaning or something in it\u2026\n\nOkay!!! That\u2019s it, ima leave the rest\u2026 thanks for reading all that if you did, I know it\u2019s a lot\u2026 \n\nQ. How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nA. I\u2019m 17, male. Hmmm\u2026 I\u2019d say I\u2019m relatively self aware, but it\u2019s something I always assumed everyone had if I\u2019m honest. I\u2019m aware of my position in life, but I\u2019ve just come to accept it and observe it in a way, I thought everyone was like this, aware and cohesive, having a formed worldview\u2026 but just not bothered to do anything about it physically. I feel like a lot of my life revolves around ideas and thoughts, cyclical patterns that I pick up, I mean, I\u2019m so lazy\u2026 like, I don\u2019t often read or watch videos to learn new information, but when I do? I become that much more confident, every step feels better when I walk outside, everything I observe perviates into my mind as this amalgamation of other things that bare similar attributes to it\u2026 that\u2019s the best way I can describe it, lmao\u2026 sounds pretentious af, I know; like those philosophers that explain everything in the most complex and sophisticated way possible to describe their ideas, but yknow, maybe they\u2019re onto something? Maybe it is the most freeing way to describe things? Or maybe it\u2019s just an aesthetic appeal\u2026 idk.\n\nQ. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nA. I\u2019m really not sure I have much to say in this department. It was very normal, aside from my parents rather rocky divorce when I was around 10-11; I\u2019m sure it had an effect on me, and if I went to see a psychologist I\u2019m sure they\u2019d say it has inflicted deep wounds or whatever\u2026 but, I think more or less I\u2019ve gotten over it after realising how little it truly matters to me that they love each other.\n\nQ. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nA. I\u2019m in college, studying sociology, English literature and Film. It\u2019s fine\u2026 I wanted to do physics, but I only found my \u201clove\u201d - I\u2019m not even sure if I do love it, at least not for what it is\u2026 if I loved it surely I\u2019d be digging into it constantly? But knowledge scares me, because it reminds me of my lack of it. Then again, physics is especially the subject that gives me that sense of \u201cwholeness\u201d that I described earlier. But yeah, I couldn\u2019t do physics since I didn\u2019t get a high enough grade. Just because I didn\u2019t really try on my exams\u2026 I didn\u2019t like physics back then: Newtonian mechanics, that kind of stuff is very boring to me. I did pass though\u2026 I passed all my subjects, god knows how\u2026\n\nQ. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nA. Idk if I\u2019d feel refreshed\u2026 this one is difficult to answer if I\u2019m honest. I find that when I\u2019m alone, I don\u2019t expend any energy but unless I\u2019m doing something I love - which is basically only physics haha, it scares me, the prospect of learning it and not being able to comprehend some of the material, so I just avoid it\u2026 but I really do like it when I get it\u2026 sometimes I just get it intuitively though? Like, if you asked me to step-by-step explain special relativity, I doubt I could without gathering my thoughts for awhile, but I understand the beauty of it so perfectly.\n\nQ. What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\nA. Idk\u2026 I\u2019m not too bothered about the physical world, although that\u2019s kind of a lie, I can binge sometimes on food\u2026 and I love eating the same chocolate bar over and over while I do something, but I also have this disdain almost for those that are fixated on it - my mom for example, although I love her to death, she\u2019s far too focused on the physical world to not annoy me a little bit.\n\nQ. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nA. I\u2019m not sure\u2026 kind of curious? I can become so fixated though sometimes. I\u2019m not curious with things that don\u2019t interest me: like I was playing Elden Ring, and in that game I took such little time to explore; I\u2019ve found this is a pattern with story games where I\u2019m given my mission and I kind of just want to reach it\u2026 but then I\u2019ll replay the game over and over again to try out different builds and play styles\u2026 but I just LOVE seeing my character develop from having \u201cmeh\u201d gear to almighty and powerful gear. Those are my favourite kinds of games, I just love that development\u2026\n\nQ. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nA. No, haha\u2026 I\u2019d be pretty bad at it, but again it all depends I suppose. I doubt I\u2019d be very good at it, probably lead everyone to their deaths, lmao.\n\nQ. Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nA. Probably not? It\u2019s hard to say\u2026 I have moments of coordination, like I went out with my friends, kicked a ball about and if I\u2019m really in the mood, I can enjoy it\u2026 most of the time I\u2019m too lethargic and distracted to pay attention to anything that\u2019s going on though.\n\nQ. Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nA. Yeah, yeah I am. Art is a very strange thing to me, because part of me hates it and part of me loves it.

{"submission": "I'm a younger teenager so my functions are still developing but I'm pretty sure I'm ENxP, but I'm not sure if I use fi>te more or if I use ti>fe more, so heres some things about me that I think may be necessary to figuring out my type since I keep going back and forth between ENFP and ENTP \n\n\n\u2022 People often say I'm very thoughtful and I tend to overthink/overanalyze things super often\n\n\u2022 At the same time though I'm also described as emotional and focus more on my own feelings than other people's \n\n\u2022 I'm annoyed by people that are more concerned with \"keeping the peace\" in an environment and ignoring a problem than trying to fix it\n\n\u2022 I believe the end justifies the means and its totally acceptable to do whatever it takes to reach a goal TO AN EXTENT. Like if it doesn't traumatize someone, go right ahead\n\n\u2022 Lately I've been super interested in detective themed things and naturally love things that involve being deductive, analytical, and so on and even like to start \"investigations\" for fun (idk how to explain it) even though I usually turn out wrong (but if this means Ti, then it would be just beginning to develop which is why I'm usually wrong)\n\n\u2022 I can't bring myself to lie and it's almost like I'm physically incapable but I don't feel like it's because I find it morally bad, it's just that it feels like a waste of time\n\n\u2022 I think there are a few examples of me using Fi in the way that they have values like, I value persistence, authenticity, cleverness etcetc\n\n\u2022 Whenever someone does something petty to show that they're \"superior\" I'm more focused on \"well whats the point/logic of that?\" Instead of \"wow, I'd never do that, that's bad\"\n\n\u2022 When trying to \"solve\" something I usually take it apart and try to do it myself and I'll take a LONGG time and open up 6 million different sources before I come to a conclusion but I'll also ask other people about it and I might even get so indecisive to where I come to a point where I ask people to review it all and just come to the conclusion for me (like what I'm doing right now) \n\n\u2022 It's difficult for me to see things as black and white because I can always come up with a way to justify practically anything in my head and can easily see the gray area, always (is this just Ne or is it a sign that I don't have a lot of Fi?)\n\n\u2022 I actually went a long time thinking that I have no morals other than \"don't be a jerk\" but I do have a few, based off of things that I was personally upset by, for example I don't like people being nosy towards me so one of my morals/values is \"don't be nosy\" and I'll get very disappointed in myself fast if I don't follow it, this is just 1 example \n\n\u2022 When I was a little younger I trolled people online as one of my main hobbies and I was just a little jerk thus contradicting my previous statement of \"don't be a jerk\" but that's fine (I feel like this is tertiary Fe)\n\n\u2022 In every test I take (I know tests are untrustworthy but this is other than 16personalities) whether it be Michael caloz, johnstest, mistype investigator, etc I always get ENTP but they also suggest enfp or intp in 2nd and 3rd place\n\n\u2022 I feel like I'm ALWAYS analyzing something and trying to solve it but the whole purpose of my analysis is to come to a conclusion of some sort or make sure I'm right about it so I'm not sure if this points to Ti or Te\n\n\u2022 I'm either VERY good or absolutely awful at reading people, no in-between.

(High-functioning autism as they call it). Also was 80% manic 20% depressed (bipolar type 1). I am on meds for adhd and the bipolar part. I am glad to say I have seen an improvement :)\n\nMy upbringing was kind of chaotic, walking on eggshells.

Don\u2019t have kids but would love to someday. I\u2019d always really wanted to adopt and foster kids.\n\nI love to be by myself. I can usually entertain myself very easily. I get drained by most people but with the right people I can be very energetic and animated.\n\nEven though I love staying inside and am a huge homebody I also enjoy staying active, so I always have to do some form of exercise and/or be outdoorsy. I\u2019m currently into BJJ.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t want to make this too long so if anyone has questions that would help, please ask, and I\u2019ll answer.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.083359286}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.7603784}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.9116197}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -5.1205335}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.2351613}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -8.056304}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -8.086881}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.818326}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.19453}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.258681}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -9.333913}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.499095}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.530913}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -10.7804365}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.90138}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -10.960792}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -11.199285}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -11.254113}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.841386}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.959134}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.00012308525}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -9.531434}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.663707}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -11.276757}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.555024}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.925572}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.355424}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -13.552506}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -13.771565}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -14.079942}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -14.619409}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.838494}, {"token": "PF", "logprob": -15.115663}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -15.276965}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -15.312806}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -15.432017}, {"token": "FT", "logprob": -15.86963}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -16.15353}, {"token": "fp", "logprob": -16.181042}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -16.26683}]}}
{"submission": "**Reasons for high Ti (or preference over Te)**\n\n* I like to rationalize everything and will believe in things that make sense to me.\n* Whenever I'm listening to a debate, I can quickly spot logical inconsistencies in arguments and think about possible counterarguments.\n* I don't really care about efficiency and productivity. I don't really like leading projects and will allow anyone to take the lead if they want to.\n* I'm not someone who is overly concerned with factual data and statistics when researching something. Even though they can be important, the reasoning behind them matters more. If they don't make sense, I won't consider them.\n* Facts are important but the reasoning between them matter more: do they make sense or is there something that seems off?\n* I like to question my position and beliefs because it\u2019s important to be open minded and to take in knowledge and information that could change my mind.\n\n**Reasons for high Ne**\n\n* I have a wide arrange of interests and I can be quick to abandon them if they don't amuse me anymore.\n* My speech pattern usually jumps from subject to subject. Also, I'm always talking about how something reminds me of another thing, which reminds me of another things and etc.\n* I find it very easy to create worlds, scenarios and characters in my mind.\n\n**Reasons for tertiary Si**\n\n* I don\u2019t mind consistency and routine but, at the end of the day, I try to change the ways I do my tasks.\n* I value past experiences that were meaningful but I don\u2019t struggle with letting go of negative past experiences or grudges.\n\n**Reasons for inferior Fe**\n\n* I'm socially anxious and awkward towards people I don't know very well.\n* I don't like dealing with my own and others' emotions. Situations that demand an immediate emotional response make me anxious and unsure how to respond.\n* I have trouble sharing feelings and demonstrating emotions freely.\n* I value my emotional connection with friends and family but I have no problem detaching myself emotionally from toxic people/environments.\n* I tend to treat others fairly and decently but I don\u2019t feel the need to if they are not decent people.\n\n**Reasons for demon Se**\n\n* My mind always wanders and I have trouble living in the moment.\n* I\u2019m very detached from the physical experience of your environment and this is one of my weaknesses. There have been multiple instances where I don\u2019t notice something right in front of me or where I\u2019m so spaced out that those around me call me out for it.\n\n**Reasons for considering ISTJ:**\n\n* Even though I procrastinate a lot, I complete my activities at work and college. I also worry about doing my projects in an organized way.\n* Even though I'm not the most organized person, I tend to have a decently tidy room and backpack.\n* I like to organize my information in my computer by files and categories.\n* I care about punctuality if it's an important event or if there will be a lot of people attending. Otherwise, I'm not punctual at all.\n* When it comes to making a presentation or going to a new place, I prefer planning ahead.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/17ldds3)", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": "ISTJ", "logprobs": {"IST": [{"token": "IST", "logprob": -0.061147183}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -3.4954257}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -3.9863944}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -5.3495708}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -6.4261947}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -6.8616195}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -7.0113177}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -7.330026}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.621412}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -8.176208}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -9.016925}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -9.8031435}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.847701}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.226808}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -10.240197}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.454614}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.52056}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -10.593562}, {"token": "Possible", "logprob": -10.670392}, {"token": "Reason", "logprob": -10.79412}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.016733175}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -4.0999355}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.11722}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -12.893734}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -13.209843}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.2225685}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -13.347702}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -13.587873}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -14.491763}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -14.880956}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -15.238532}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -15.3296995}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -15.368108}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -15.406846}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -15.459249}, {"token": "K", "logprob": -15.475301}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -15.523281}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -15.585427}, {"token": "M", "logprob": -15.864634}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -15.986059}]}}

{"submission": "Could someone help me identify my mbti type? I'm between two but I want to hear your thoughts.\n\nsorryfor the long text btw\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 19, female, 5'5, medium black hair, wear glasses, and I'm Brazilian (I don't know how any of this is pertinent)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnxiety and High abilities/giftedness and undiagnosed depression, social anxiety and possibly autism\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard to describe it, but I've always been extremely shy and timid, the true definition of a shut in. I've never voiced my opinions and feelings and cried often as a child, as I grew up, I realized I was/am trans and met oppression from my family, that was the last straw for me as I isolated myself from nearly all human contact for years, staying in my room conducting reasearchs and studying, quite literally, everything, meanwhile I turned truly apathetic (I was around 12 or 13 by then). At 17 I began to take more control over my own life, I've made friends online and started to listen more to their feelings, later I began to stop ignoring my feelings, still I wasn't able to determine what feeling was what precisely (of course I could with the more simple ones, but I couldn't tell pride and happiness apart). Nowadays, I'm still as much of a shut in as always, and I still have some trouble dealing with feelings, but I am learning.\n\nAs far as religion goes, I've studied multiple and my whole family have been a mixture of Catholicism, African based religions and witchcraft, I personally believe and practice the later one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnemployed, but I study, and love it as much as I don't plan to ever stop doing so. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy latest weekends have been like that I suppose, so neither, I feel normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove to study everything, read, sing, listen to music, play and watch streams of video games. I'm horrible at and hate sports. I don't go out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd question why I earned a trophy of most curious, I'd say I do have more ideas than I can execute, I am also quite lazy due to habit. I'm curious about everything really, practical, conceptual, spiritual, everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not good with people and even worse at leadership, I'm not able to impose myself and more often than not let people talk over me. Still, were I obligated to be a leader I'd probably implement a t\u00e1tica I've read about in programming team management where everyone will do something solo and other will correct anonymously without knowing who it is from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have horrible hand coordination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forms of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI lack artistic talent for anything else than poetry, those of which are philosophic and melancholic, I don't know if I'm good at it for only my friends have read it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's weird, I hate the idea of growing old because I still feel like I have much to learn in very little time, yet I keep on procrastinating and acting as if I had Infinite time. I have a extremely good memory but don't seem to hold my past in them, I forgot some of it and rather evade the rest.\n\nI also have little to no time awareness, and quite often use too much or too little time on stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepends on who, what and why. If it is someone I hate, I won't help regardless. Someone I like, I just wouldn't help if it would bring something negative to them. In a neutral scenario if the person truly needs help I'll do because I most likely would be able to show off some of the knowledge I accumulated in these years, if not, I'd request some sort of payment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Do you need logical consistency in your life?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLogical inconsistency more likely, I try to be logical, but fail some times, my logic is based often in deductions and subjective interpretation of knowledge. I don't require others around me to be logical tho\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How important are efficiency and productivity to you?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant in a grand scale of somethings, but I don't care about it in my personal life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNope, I'm quite naive so the opposite happens, I often get used by people I distrust because I saw no harm in trying to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always been able to learn stuff easily, no matter the style of teaching. I do prefer theory over parctice in learning tho\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you tend to wing projects and improvise as you go?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm probably average at it honestly, I hate not having a plan, but just a general one is fine. I do tend to plan more (and often more than I should) in stuff that require social skills, I prefer to just improvise on those, or I'll procrastinate months getting ready\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll keep studying and participating in colleges throughout all my life span, probably work on whathever I can/feel like or whatever pays more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate?\\* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime and interactions, as said before. Also to loose the people I care about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHard to say, moments my researchs made some developments, compliments I recieved and moments I could use intelligence and/or creativity for problem solving. Also the moments I met my friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe time I came out to my family and the multiple assalts they commited against me. Also high school, it was mostly online but I had to go for a few weeks, I suffered some forms of sexual assalts and retaliated with agression, not stuff I'm proud of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI daydream a ton, probably more than the average person\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about it?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would talk to myself and simulate conversations with people I've met, also probably link stuff I've learned along the years (as example how the medieval churchs are connected to nowadays social stigmas and etc). Once I got bored I'd probably try to find a way out\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make a decision is quick for me, I take time to execute it. I cam change if I learn or deduce something new\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I do process them it's instantly, other than that I could try for years and be unable to understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm overcoming this, I'm still unable to be honest if the truth impact directly the person. Other than that I'm quite blunt (when stating facts or making fun of something)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't often break rules as I barely have any imposed to me, I do question them often and encourge people to break them. Someone wise should be allowed to give advices without suffering oppression, someone wiser will do it rightfully despite the oppression, authority should be questioned for the evolution of it.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": {" IN": [{"token": " IN", "logprob": -0.90351087}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.92020017}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -2.228521}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.6590383}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -4.5355244}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.845909}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.9350605}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.434845}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -7.933264}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.9359016}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.127361}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -8.138071}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.292175}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.488226}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -8.565491}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -8.915096}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -9.186552}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -9.699463}, {"token": " It", "logprob": -9.7242775}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -9.756374}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.3993343}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -1.1155399}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.7950406}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.351913}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -10.1946125}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -10.463823}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -10.688341}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.690296}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.112658}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.219831}, {"token": "t", "logprob": -13.335867}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -13.431143}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -14.003305}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -14.287018}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -14.569563}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -14.697895}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -14.800749}, {"token": "***", "logprob": -14.922747}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -14.97414}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -15.159061}]}}

I ran away from home when I was 3 yrs old, because I felt like my mom was restricting my innate sense of adventure that I was dying to explore. I truly felt as if I was old enough to be responsible. \nMy overall experience of my childhood was one of feeling unsafe and deeply misunderstood.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\nI am being trained to become a professional peer advocate, meaning I am being taught how to work in a recovery-oriented manner. My personal dream and aspiration, is to have a multidisciplinary approach. I firmly believe that healing can be found in community (connecting with other, sharing vulnerability) and creation (both through creative endeavors as well as by recreating, rewriting ones own narrative about the self). I also feel a strong need to be capable of working in different environments and with different people, different projects. Creativity and community are also mandatory for me if I want to be able to function myself. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\nI am great at spending my time alone. There\u2019s always something creative that I can do, or I\u2019d just go outside and absorb the environment, feel refreshed and inspired by it. I have a very vivid inner world, where I am always interacting with my daydream characters, so I don\u2019t ever feel alone when I\u2019m alone anyway. My daydream characters are typically just people from my real life, but also celebrities, the author of a book I\u2019m currently reading, stuff like that. \nHalf of the time, when I\u2019m alone, I just have solo dance and karaoke parties though. With said daydream characters being present in my mind (and with that my experience of reality, even though I know it\u2019s fake) as well. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\nI like activities that stimulate my mind and feed my creative energy. That includes most cultural things, like going to the theater, the museum (those are my favs). I also love thrifting. And birdwatching! \nI love both indoor and outdoor activities - what matters more to me, is how stimulating the activity is. \nI am not very good at sports, mostly due to my shitty hand-eye coordination and my fear of fast moving objects (like balls) lol. And sports don\u2019t stimulate my mental realm, so even though it makes me feel more relaxed afterwards, I\u2019m not naturally drawn to it for that reason. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\nI am very curious and have 1000 more ideas than I can execute, or even put into words. \nMost of my curiosities relate to the human experience somehow, but also to creating things that don\u2019t exist (this mostly applies to my visual art - I despise not being original!). \nI love getting to the core of the human experience and feel like I\u2019m actually getting there. I am constantly finding new puzzle pieces that fit into what I intuitively already felt to be the truth. Nothing excites me more that learning that someone with a great status has written about something in their book for example, and that I already came to that conclusion by myself beforehand! And this happens very, very often. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\nPeople often think of me as a leader-type, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable in that position. Simultaneously, I do tend to take it on, mostly because I love to form new groups. I am usually the one who initiates e.g. e group chat, a group activity, stuff like that. \nI usually end up distancing myself from the formed group and can thoroughly enjoy the fact that I know I made people connect to each other whilst feeling comfortable moving onto the next thing in my own life. \n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\nHmm, not so sure if I am. I am very messy with my approach to things, often going from one thing to the completely opposite thing, to something else and back to where I started. Could be the ADHD though, hard to say. \nI love working with my hands when it comes to creativity, like painting for example. I love exploring what different materials can do and how I can interact with them in innovative ways. \n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\nI am very artistic, but it doesn\u2019t always come easy. I am so inclined on being unique with what I do that I sometimes nearly feel immobilized prior to starting a project, simply out of the fear of my work not being authentic. \nBut, once I get started, I cannot be stopped. I love seeing how things unfold. I suck at trying to plan what I\u2019m going to create beforehand - that\u2019s also what causes me to freeze. It feels very unnatural to approach my creative processes like that. \nMy art is typically \u2018dark\u2019 (according to others), but to me, they\u2019re just about my life. I love to capture the most painful moments in a very direct manner. \n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\nI like to think of myself as a time traveller - I can easily go back into my consciousness from the past and feel like I exist in that time again. For me, the entire experience of the self is always just that - an experience - and therefore, the time in which it finds place is not as relevant. I can feel as if I\u2019m living in the past, present and future in one day, simply because that\u2019s where I choose to let my consciousness go. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\nI easily feel offended when offered help, as if the other person is underestimating my abilities to do it myself, or as if they feel I\u2019m not efficient enough. \nI also rarely think about helping others, I naturally try and see how we can be most efficient by doing things alone together instead. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\nMeh, not really. I don\u2019t like consistency anyway. \nI am not very logical myself, so I find in comfortable when life mirrors that back to me. It makes me feel more connected to the world around me. \n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\nVery important, but also something I\u2019m not always good at. I recognize the importance and can even feel very frustrated when I think of other people as inefficient. \nAs for being productive, I feel constantly torn between wanting to be productive and wanting to just chill and experience life as is without any expectations. It\u2019s a true 50/50 situation for me, this one. Or at least that\u2019s what it feels like. \n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\nI tend to give (unsolicited) advice and can feel offended when people are doubting my truth in regards of their situation. I have often already put so much work into trying to understand something (albeit mostly through just \u2018feeling\u2019 that it\u2019s right rather that basing it off of facts), that when people reject my advice I can sometimes feel rejected as a whole. \nI rationally understand that this is fucked up lol. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\nAnything creative, anything adventurous, anything new and inspiring. \nCreative and mental stimulation are mandatory and I feel they can be found in so many things. I cannot make a definitive selection. I love to find new hobbies and interests. \nBut as for today, I enjoy painting, drawing, learning to play the guitar/ukulele, dancing, thrift shopping, reading (mostly non-fiction), listening to podcasts, going to the theater, the museum or spend time in nature. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\nI am a \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d type learner. Very visual. \nI love just sitting in a class and listening to theory, then discussing it with my classmates. I absolutely need that outlet to process my newfound knowledge, or else I feel like I go insane. \nCreativity always makes me happy, so that\u2019s also great. I love getting out of my head again and creative endeavors can help me do that as well. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\nI am great at coming up with new ideas and am not great at breaking it all up in manageable tasks. I need brainstorm sessions in order to be able to fill in all of the gaps I leave in at first. \nI love to improvise as well, going with the flow of life. \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\nThe description I provided under the question about my career already answers most of this. I aim to build a life that just breathes creativity, innovation and community. I struggle with the latter (could be my C-PTSD, lot of relational trauma). I need novelty and stability to me just means that I won\u2019t get into financial trouble when doing the things I long to do. It\u2019s not much about having X or Y. I\u2019d rather have less and do more than the other way around. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\nI fear not being of importance and not living up to my own full potential, I fear ending up alone because of this. It makes me uncomfortable to realize that most people have certain expectations of someone my age, since my timeline is so different from most people my age. I fear being misunderstood and undervalued because of this. \nI hate it when people are dehumanizing other people for any reason and I hate when I catch myself doing that exact thing. I hate being a hypocrite, but I also realize that this is all so human in and on it\u2019s own. I love that I can always come back to that realization. That, no matter what I do, I am always just human. And then I hate that most people seem to fail to see things this way. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\nLike me being bubbly and excitable for a new project or idea that I\u2019ve come up or crossed paths with. Finding new courage and confidence in myself and being very expressive about that to the outer world. The way my own existence can make me want to dance and smile! \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\nLike my laying under my covers and not thinking or feeling much, just trying to fill the emptiness with snacks and doom scrolling. Not feeling connected to people at all, even losing my sense of having friends and loved ones. \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\nI daydream constantly, unless I\u2019m interacting with an actual person. I always daydream about real people and events and rarely about unrealistic fantasy worlds. Most of my daydreams are a mere reflection of my unmet needs, like the need to feel loved and appreciated, understood, even celebrated. \nI actively involve my surroundings in my daydreams, but also change the backdrop for the situation in my mind. It\u2019s a constant switch between the real world and other locations, it just depends on what the daydream is about. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\nI am already daydreaming about being with other people and turn this situation into a game. Like, we\u2019re in a escape room together and I start to interact with my characters and think about how each of them interacts with me in return. We\u2019d probably just end up in a deep convo. I might fall in love with one of the characters, but we can only express this through subtle body language, for the other people cannot find out. I dream about how she and I cannot wait until we\u2019re out of this empty room. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\nI tend to ask others for advice, since my own mind often isn\u2019t enough for me to figure things out. I also just love hearing other people\u2019s perspective on things in general. \nI can change my mind, but only once I feel like the decision is not in line with my own values (anymore). I often change my mind once I start to listen to my own gut feeling again. Then, I ask advice and eventually change direction. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\nDo I ever? I feel like my emotions are a constant, not sure if I ever even truly process them? I just attach meaning to the experience of the emotion, but that meaning ends up being linked to the experience that caused the emotion rather than the emotion itself. \nEmotions are my inner call for action, they are holy. But I am still learning how to attune to those calls. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\nYes, but only when I already know my thoughts and ideas around a subject are so vastly different that it\u2019d trigger them and create conflict. I avoid conflict like the plague. \nThat being said, I won\u2019t agree with the other person either in a situation like this. I\u2019d just actively listen to them, nod along and think to myself \u201cWow, this shit is fucked up\u201d. But I\u2019m also eager to learn how they came to this vision and often have to ability to just \u2018get\u2019 it based on what I\u2019ve analyzed about them or people similar to them. This is not always the truth of course and I need to learn to not judge too harshly. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\nI am more inclined to see where the rules can be broken before even trying to follow them. \nAnything that is presented to us as being set in stone should be challenged. I am a non-dualist by nature and believe the status quo is full of flaws and very dualistic in nature.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.081733234}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.5178142}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -3.7313704}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -3.812509}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -6.955108}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -7.7452235}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.143835}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.162136}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.597929}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -9.099945}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -9.211002}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -10.088863}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -10.495451}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -10.555716}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.580959}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -10.816088}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -10.901844}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.054653}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -11.092354}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.128553}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0015679495}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.7790604}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.429081}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -9.642088}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.740198}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -10.348999}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.517485}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.192587}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -12.529243}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.588455}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -12.691618}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -13.009506}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -13.083235}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -13.151825}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -13.213896}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -13.334629}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -13.535679}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -13.75937}, {"token": "CP", "logprob": -13.781072}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -13.849997}]}}

Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\nHomeschooled, Christian extremist cult..

Pain is profound, happiness is beautiful, art would be boring without both.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\nPast only exists in our memory, memory is faulty thus we can not rely on it. The future doesn't even exist yet, we can only aim out trajectory and even then we cannot predict the future, thus its too many variables we cannot rely on it. The present is the only thing we have the power over to change and it's too beautiful to ignore.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)?

I often thought I understood something, would explain the process back, but when pen hit paper it was all wrong. It took me years to realize the disabilities I had but before I knew the truth I was determined to learn to read and read a whole book upside-down and have been able to read since. So to answer the question, I will fucking find a way to understand no matter what.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks?

{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\n20, female. I don't know how to describe myself.. I don't really have any perception of myself lol. I think I'm pretty calm and easygoing on the outside, but on the inside pretty chaotic and scattered. I'm a hermit, I don't really like to get involved with many people and prefer to spend my time reading or being at home.\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nGAD, depression, PTSD.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nEssentially I brought up myself, so I had no religious or structured influence. I tended to gravitate somewhat towards spirituality though, but never really deciding on any one religion or thought system in general. Even now, my view on spirituality and the world is less fixed. I take from a lot of different religious and spiritual systems to develop my belief system but it couldn't really be classified as anything. I think I just pretty much succumbed to the unstructured lifestyle, not really having a sleep schedule or eating regularly or anything. Growing up I kinda just did whatever I wanted whenever I felt like it. Even now I tend to do that, I have trouble sticking to a routine for very long or having any sort of schedule. I prefer to let things free flow.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI work in a grocery store. I don't really like it because most of the customers are pretty impatient and treat you like a robot. For me of course ideally I would not even want to work but I want money so it is what it is lol.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nMost of the time I end up feeling refreshed. Especially after a few days of socializing or working, I can't wait to just get home and sit on my computer and act like a potato for hours on end. Sometimes if I have a particularly social day at work it's the most relieving thing to just get off that shift.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI.. don't do sports at all. I am horrible at them.. they are boring.. and I don't really like competition at all. I like going on walks in nature though, but I wouldn't say I really do it a lot. I sometimes just like walking around in shopping areas just looking at things.. isn't that technically its own genre of exercise?\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you?

What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am very curious about literally everything I hear about. If I even hear a word about something I've never heard about, I instantly go to research it. Sometimes to my detriment cause you know being on Reddit a lot you hear about a lot of strange rabbitholes. My ideas are both environmental and conceptual, sometimes I get an idea based on something I see in front of me and will follow it further, such as a health issue that I will delve into deeply and think about what I could do to cure it that might not be obvious. Other times I have very conceptual thoughts, some like I mentioned earlier about spirituality or the meaning of being alive, others maybe more philosophical but you could question if that is environmental or conceptual. I have a lot of ideas about what ifs, like what if we were living in a simulation, and if we were what are the signs that we are? But the thing is that all of that only leads to more questions and loose ends, so you can really question it forever.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI don't like leadership roles. I don't really like the concept of leadership in general because I think it tends to divide people and allows you to see certain people as better when they are just human. It also puts people in a position to pretend to act like they know everything, even if they don't have the answers. If I was to lead I would prefer to take a team approach, and instead let everybody brainstorm in a way that best suits their own strengths. I think one person can't have every strength, and so working as a team rather than with a leader will be the best way to maximize effectiveness and also prevent people from thinking that their work is not valuable and losing morale.\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not coordinated. I literally just cut off part of my finger slicing cheese because I was zoned off. I don't mind working with my hands but ideally not with sharp objects because I am prone to focusing on my thoughts over my body. I do like painting sometimes but not really. I would rather just use my phone or computer over any physical hobbies, but I do want to try developing more.\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI do like to write poems, but I don't do it very often. I love all forms of art. Especially music, poetry, and paintings. But I really love to look at it all. To look inside the mind of somebody else is very interesting to me. I also just like things that are visually beautiful lol.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past is something that haunts me. I try not to focus on it mostly, but sometimes it will come back with a vengeance. Mostly I just tend to remember things that were bad that happened, and what I can learn from them. Everything I go through has a lesson. I mostly try to focus myself on the present, but it's not always easy. I don't even think I tend to focus on any of the 3, but instead they just kinda pop into my head occasionally like hey remember this happened or remember to focus on what you are doing right now. With the future, it's also complicated because I tend to overthink a lot of what could happen. I'm always worrying about the future and what could be. But I tend not to think very long into my own personal future, but I do think about the impersonal future like when I'm thinking about the end of the world or how the Earth is going to flip on us or how aliens will show themselves or how the AI uprising will impact people etc. That kind of thing is interesting to me.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI will help people if they ask. I admit that I don't always want to, actually I mostly don't really want to. BUT I'm also just not going to be like NO I'm not going to help you. So I just do it. I do like to help people if they are having issues mentally, or if they need to be taken care of physically for reasons such as sickness etc. But with some stuff like HEY can you help me move this table or something I will do it but I don't particularly want to lol. I do a lot of things because I don't necessarily want to say no but I don't particularly want to do it either.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nThis one is tough because although I will always say yes to this question logic tends to mean different things to different people. I do what is logically consistent to me personally but some people might look at what I think is logical and view it as illogical or ineffective etc. I do what makes logical consistent sense to me but that might not be the same for everybody.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nNot very important. Sometimes I go kind of insane if I have to be too efficient or productive. I do try to get stuff done before the due date.. but that's just because it gives me anxiety if it's unfinished. Sometimes I do procrastinate very far, like I'll have a month to do something and I'll do it 5 hours before it's due. So I wouldn't really say that important at all because if I could avoid it I would.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI'm not really controlling at all. I think everybody should be allowed to be their own person. If I don't like what you are doing, I just won't involve you in my life. I still think everybody should have freedom. I might not always approve of what other people are doing, but I don't think it's really my place to tell them what to do. I only would if it's something that seriously crosses a line for me.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy favorite hobbies are thinking about things, reading anything, browsing Reddit, and watching video essays. I also have a bad habit of scrolling too far on TikTok a lot. I like them because they are intellectually stimulating I guess? Like if I go too long without any mental stimulation I go a bit crazy. I also like blasting music at 100 and singing karaoke sometimes. Also eating. I like to go out to eat a lot lol. I don't think that's a hobby I'm pretty sure most people do that but.. these are the things that fill the majority of my life.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI can't do verbal learning. Everything will just get tossed into the trash because I am thinking of something else and then I realize I didn't hear anything the person just said. I do a lot better with just reading about things on my own time, I don't particularly try to memorize anything. It just happens or it doesn't, I find that forcing things to stick makes me forget them even quicker because I hate it so much. I do like creativity in my classes because it makes it more fun, and I also like hands on learning too because I think it's easier to remember something the more times that I do it.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI don't break up anything into anything. I just do improvise and let it happen. Everything I do, I do without a plan and just jump into it in hopes it works lol.\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI have no real aspirations. I just want to be happy. I want to have a family. And I want to be free to do the things that I want to do without feeling bound to anything in particular, apart from people who I care about.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nWell I have GAD so practically everything makes me fearful and uncomfortable lol. I hate when creativity and uniqueness are stifled so that everybody can be the same. I think it's the worst thing how people would prefer to have everybody be the same and I can never understand the logic behind it. I know why institutions do it, so that they can control people and make them more malleable towards whatever agenda they have planned for people's lives. But when it comes to people doing it just because, is it because they are brainwashed that they refuse to believe that other people can be different than them and have it be ok? I can't understand it at all. Not everybody has to be the same. Not everybody has to think the same. It's almost like the greatness of being a species with intelligence is that we can do great things by doing things differently. I also hate it when people refuse to believe that their actions have consequences, or just refuse to believe that they are a problem or have a problem. Everybody has problems, but if you don't admit it you are just doing yourself a disservice by lying to yourself over and over. Self awareness is a good thing, and more people should have it.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe highs in my life are rare but they are nice when they exist. I'm very calm, very easygoing, I go deep into my hobbies, I tend to know exactly what I want and where I'm going with what I'm doing. I don't have any dissatisfaction with my life.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI get extremely emotional. I question pretty much everything about my life, wondering if what I'm doing is really best and if I should change. I get very anxious, and I also doubt myself and my perception of reality entirely.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nNot attached to reality at all. I try so hard to be focused on the moment, I try different grounding exercises, etc. I just end up going back to being in my head all the time. I am very unaware of my surroundings and people always make fun of me for it lol. I always miss the most obvious shit. ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M INTENSELY DAYDREAMING. But I am pretty much all the time so it does not bode well. I just think the external world is extremely boring and mundane. My head is a lot more interesting lol.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nPretty much the same things I always think about. Theories about existence, the universe, and life. I also like to think about psychology and behavioral patterns or philosophy. I'll also think about things I've previously read. Pretty much everything I can think of will cross my mind, especially if I have nothing else to do.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nWell. I never keep any of my decisions because I make them in one second and then switch them one second later it seems like. So not very long.. but I also change my mind pretty soon after. I have a hard time settling on one thing.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me awhile to process emotions. I try to acknowledge them as soon as I can, but as far as processing and dealing with them it can take MONTHS. It's a pretty slow process at times. Some things I still haven't fully processed or quite gotten over, because I just tend to push my feelings down a lot of the time or tell myself to just move on. Sometimes I think pushing them down is for the better, but then by the time you realize it isn't it's hard to pick it up again because they've cemented themselves.\n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI don't really like to force myself to agree with people, but sometimes if I'm talking to someone whose a bit more sensitive I will try to avoid saying certain things so that they don't get upset or a fight starts. I guess the key is to just know your audience, but I tend to not like to do it. Sometimes I will though in cases where if I agree with someone they will keep talking about a subject, because I like to hear peoples thoughts on things and sometimes if you act like you know they won't keep telling you.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't really give any fucks about rules lol. I don't know the rules anywhere I go, typically rules don't matter that much as long as you are not being an asshole I notice. But I don't care and will break rules often probably just because I don't pay attention to them. I think it depends on the authority figure we are talking about. One person might not know everything and that's fine, and in that case they can be challenged. But I also don't think you can diminish somebodies potential for knowledge just because they are authority, like saying EVERY SINGLE AUTHORITATIVE FIGURE SHOULD BE CHALLENGED. That just seems stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you anyone who can help!

on them\n\n- is expressing her emotions very easily\n\n- values information only from good sources, loves to read on the internet about nutrition and document herself about it\n\n- she is a very friendly person,can start talking with any age group if she wants to and she usually lets people talk a lot about themselves because she does not like to talk about herself\n- and also does not like gossip at all\n- however, if there is a neutral subject she engages normally\n\n- she always ends up taking initiative and having a leader-like position\n\n-wants to be ready for anything that can happen and usually maps out a plan for the day in her mind and asks us about it\n\n-likes to try new things and making new recipes by adjusting recipes she already knows\n\n-wants to be unique, and also giving her child(me) a different education\n\n-is very open-minded, however when i was little she assumed that if she liked a certain food i had to like it too\n\n-she always used to say that i 100% look like my dad (he is an istp) and act like him, but as i grew up i am acting more and more like my mom but still remained with some traits of my dad's personality(i am an entp)\n\n- always changes her mind \n\n- sometimes she comes up with so many ideas at once about what she should do in a situation \n\n- a very direct person who is not afraid of the truth(she used to call me spoiled and when i asked her if i was a good child she said i was not, i was a spoiled one etc etc.)\n\n- likes to twist information in such a way that it comes to her advantage but when you look at it from every side its actually true\n\n-is very invested in everything she does\n\n-does not care about those couple standards like sleeping both in the same bed etc etc\n\n- when i was little she was not accepting the fact that i percieve the world differently and process information in another way, same with having a different perspective \n\n-jokes come naturally when she socalizes\n\n- she puts ZERO value in having friends, though she has some facebook ones\n\n- i am convinced that when i was little like till 8-9 she was unhealthy or in some kind of grip/loop as she was very stressed because she needed to take care of me(when i was a baby) and also working and i was a very stubborn baby , when my dad came home she used to scream at both of us thogh i dont remember it then as i grew up she was very overprotective and did not let me go to another friends house because \"what if something falls on your head\"\n\n- does not care about how is she looking, giving zero s**ts about makeup(just a foundation and a crayon) and convincing me to do the same\n\n- very invested and organized in what she does and also her hobbies, though she is not very open to learning new things or playing a new game (she just tries to do new things but does not like to learn new things)\n\n- always advices me to not trust anyone, just my parents\n\nidk if its very clear based on this description but yall can

{"submission": "\nI'm an adult, F. Thanks in advance.\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nYes, it did. I grew up a devout Christian, but later with insight I began to question religion itself. I don't believe in any gods now, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fearful of what happens after death. Many times I've come close to deluding myself into believing again.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nRefreshed. I just really want to be alone after spending a lot of time socializing with others.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nIndoor activities like playing games and reading. I like walking as an outdoor activity, or swimming.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? \n\nCurious to the point I start many things and leave them halfway finished. I don't like doing that, but my responsibilities come first, that is, school and family. I'm often curious about things related to art, literature, psychology, and philosophy.\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI would, if everyone in my team would cooperate. I'm assertive and could be harsh as a leader. I used to be the opposite in my younger years, pleasing everyone until it burned me out. I would rather not take up leadership.\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI hate working with my hands because nothing comes naturally. I burn anything I cook, damage anything I try to repair. But I like to clean as much as I can.\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI do writing and some art. They don't have a definitive style; I experiment.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI honor the past, but I'd prefer if I didn't get stuck on it. I like the present, though it's hard for me to live in it. The future is gloomy to me, but I dwell on it the most.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI would help immediately if they're close to me, or if the situation is dire. If they aren't and I still decide to help, it's probably because I can sympathize, or for my own benefit. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes. Without logic everything just falls into disorder.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery, but I slack off a lot. It's probably stress or I'm just sabotaging my own life, which I beat myself up a lot for.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI guess so. Many have said that.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nA long time.

{"submission": "I\u2019ve  been into mbti for two years and for a long time I thought I was an intp. But recently I\u2019ve been learning more about cognitive functions and I\u2019m starting to call that into question since I lean into some fi traits. I\u2019ve done a lot of research, yet I\u2019m still confused, because I can see both fi and ti with in me. I\u2019m leaning toward intp, though I don\u2019t trust my judgement, because I believe I might be biased. Also I suffer from some mental illnesses and disabilities, so that might be skewing my perspective. So I\u2019m reaching to this subreddit as a last resort.\n\n* For starters, I believe I\u2019m a bit argumentative. During conflict I usually won\u2019t back down unless the other person admits their wrong or I realize I was wrong (I almost never \u2018agree to disagree\u2019). But only on certain topics that I\u2019m passionate about and that I truly believe I\u2019m right about. Also I\u2019m pretty keen on pointing out logical fallacies in arguments. But I also hate debates, because of how mentally and emotionally taxing they are.\n* If I\u2019m met with a subject that I\u2019m not knowledgeable on or on the fence about I usually try to get the perspectives of other people on both sides and try to do research on it.\n* In my head I like to come up with stories and fantasies, but I also like to reevaluate my thoughts and opinions on real world situations.\n* Since I spend a lot of time in my head just thinking I sometimes miss things right in front of me, so I come across as forgetful and absentminded.\n* I think a lot about how certain structures in our society affect who we are and what we believe is normal (For example how gender socialization affects how men and women interact with the world differently)\n* I\u2019m usually very stoic the only intense emotions I tend to feel are anger and sadness, but I try not to let it show especially not in public. I get a bit grossed out with conversations having to do with emotions. (For example a lot of adults in my life have confronted me about my mental health, but i usually don\u2019t say anything or I tell them that I\u2019m fine)\n* I struggle with keeping a conversation going and I\u2019m bad with small talk (even with close friends) unless it\u2019s a topic I\u2019m interested in. I sometimes even get annoyed when people approach me, because I hate talking. (I\u2019m severely socially inept lol). Despite this I still crave intimacy from another person. And I do somewhat care about other people but it\u2019s hard for me to express that.\n* I sometimes get obsessed with a certain topic  and I\u2019ll do a lot of research and collect knowledge about that topic I\u2019m interested in just for the sake of it.\n* As a child I was pretty critical about the social norms around me like gender roles and submitting to authority. And I constantly questioned why certain things were considered good and bad in society (I\u2019m still critical about social norms, but I\u2019m less rebellious than I was when I was younger)\n* Currently one of my biggest fears is the fear of judgement or rejection. And I sometimes tend to be sensitive to criticism. When I think I\u2019ve been wronged I get defensive and I become cold, rude and belittling. If I\u2019m pushed to my limit I can lash out violently.\n* Also I\u2019m into art and music I\u2019ve been drawing since 2nd grade and I\u2019ve been to art school. Now art is mainly just a hobby that I indulge in when ever I\u2019m bored. When drawing I enjoy the process and the final product (if it\u2019s good). With music I listen to it as a coping mechanism (sort of) to vent strong emotions if I\u2019m really upset about something. \n* When making decisions or forming opinions I try to come up with what is most logical regardless of how I actually feel. I\u2019m also pretty indecisive though \n* In my free time I like to watch video essays on random topics.\n* I grew up Muslim but I\u2019m now agnostic mainly because there\u2019s no real proof God exists but there\u2019s no real proof it doesn\u2019t, but even if it did I don\u2019t think I\u2019d really care.\n\nI\u2019ll stop here or else it\u2019d be too long. And I don\u2019t have any thing else important to add. Sorry if this is messy or if some of these points don\u2019t make sense it\u2019s hard to organize my thoughts on paper in a coherent manner. And I hope some of these don\u2019t seem too edgy. Anyways I\u2019m mainly stuck between intp and infp, but if you think I might be something else then I\u2019d appreciate if you shared why too.\n\n(again sorry that this is long and rambly)", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP", "logprobs": {"INT": [{"token": "INT", "logprob": -0.22192843}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -1.6438855}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -5.643819}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -7.1820803}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.7596807}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.51492}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -9.015412}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.144757}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.211555}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.234757}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.544927}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -10.164821}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.583182}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -10.876098}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -11.004336}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.130868}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -11.218776}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -11.238984}, {"token": "int", "logprob": -11.252835}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -11.434983}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -9.7583004e-05}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -9.301401}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -12.90497}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.167343}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.1083355}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -14.834242}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -15.398558}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -16.715954}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.744783}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -16.852093}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -17.791838}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -17.977373}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -18.10029}, {"token": "(P", "logprob": -18.19196}, {"token": "PO", "logprob": -18.271694}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -18.311062}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -18.485764}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -18.493275}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -18.561413}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -18.745174}]}}
{"submission": "uhh so my coworker and i got into a situationship but anyways that's for another sub... i'm wondering if you guys can help me type them? they said they don't remember what mbti they've gotten in the past, but my guess is leaning towards ENFJ or ENFP but could be something entirely different i'm not sure!! I'm personally an INFP and we get along sooo well it's kind of crazy how much we bounce off each other. Our humor matches well and we always know what the other is kind of thinking. A lot of our conversations are based on inside jokes and we like repeating what the other said in the past if that makes sense haha.\n\nHere are some of his traits:\n\n* At first glance he seems like a social extrovert to me, but he says he identifies more as an introvert. \n* He's extremely empathetic and gets along really well with everyone. He always acknowledges everyone and they all know him somehow. From day one I always thought he had a genuinely kind heart and warmth to him.\n* He loves sports, fitness, staying active. Huge granola guy and loves nature, earth, all of the above. \n* He's very crafty; good at building things and even used to do a lot of woodshop stuff like making chairs \n* He loves staying in the moment and having fun then and there\u2014 very present. One of my conversations with him was about me worrying about the future complications our relations could cause and that I have all these reasons why we can't pursue anything further. His argument was that I don't need to overthink so much and live in the moment\u2014 it doesn't have to be so serious and the future is uncertain so let loose. :T \n* Very adventurous and spontaneous now; he said in the past, he used to be pretty strict about being on time and expecting his friends to do the same, but over time he's learned to be more fluid.\n* He doesn't mind change at all and constantly seeks adventure; he moves around and once moved to a whole new state with just his van and had no job or house planned ahead. He says he doesn't worry about those things because it will all work out in the end.\n* Very open-end future for him; he never counts anything out and says he has all the time in the world to fulfill any of his dreams or anything he wants to do. \n* Some things he says a lot and lives by: \"It's not the end of the world\" \"No problems, no worries\" \"It's not a big deal\"\n* He remembers a lot of small details!!\n* He mentioned things always weirdly align for him\n* He likes to say he's a lover not a fighter lol; he's quite romantic and gentle but also very intense\n\nFrom my own analysis, I thought he most definitely had Fe and Se in his function stack, which is why ENFJ made the most sense to me. But it's tripping me up how much he doesn't really plan for anything and really go-with-the-flow which I feel contradicts the ENFJ's ability to plan around their goals and future. I'm not sure!!

unable to be efficient in things that truly matters due to my undiagnosed adhd.\n\nI help others and expect loyalty, if they don't show me loyalty then I won't help them again and that's how I control others usually, help them and have a trade, make others be grateful to you so that when I am in trouble they might help me in return.\n\nI don't have many hobbies and I usually like things related to designing and progressing towards a specific ideal.\n\nMy learning style is basically read the book, understand it and then practice, I don't prefer classes as I tend to learn fast so unlike some of my peers I can just read text and be on my way, that's kinda the reason I can study at last minute and still get A ranks and things that involve memory is my weakness, I can't memorize details I can just get a gist of the concept and then fill in the details automatically at times.\n\nI am good at strategising but bad at following it.\n\nOne of my main aspirations is to get independence and then plan my finances towards what I like the most.\n\nI take decision based on logic and I day dream often but can stay in reality and am usually quite observant of my surroundings but also can't find the pen right in front of me.\n\nEmotions aren't that important and I can usually process them fast actually I don't know whether I process them or not and I do tend to regret some of my decisions because I don't like it maybe and I do break rules at times because I think the rule is dumb, I bunked classes because I can learn faster in home so yea.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": "INTP",

{"submission": "Female 40. I posted in the ISFP group but wanted to post here too. Really need help with finding my type. Too much information it seems with a lot of stereotypes. \n\nI'm not artistically driven. I appreciate art, music, movies, etc but am not a creator of such things. I am not too concerned with aesthetics meaning my walks are bare lol and I have no problem rotating out the same 3-4 outfits all the time.

{"submission": "\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\ni am 22 years old and i currently identify as female. i would consider myself more of a creative, i enjoy looking at art and making art of my own. i have a zest for learning, but i\u2019m not the greatest at analyzing or critically thinking which makes me feel inferior to others. i have been told i am considerate, kind, and that i have a calming energy that helps soothe others.\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nyes, i have ADHD-PI, chronic depression, and general anxiety.\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nmy upbringing was not supervised well; it lacked any religious influences and i grew up more under the eye of my aunt and uncle rather than my actual parents who kept me in line when the need arose. i would follow whatever they say because i recognized they knew better and that they only had my best interests at heart and mind. i was a complacent, passive, and sensitive child.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\ni do not currently have one, but if i had to choose it would be becoming a singer-songwriter if that counts for anything.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\ni would feel refreshed in most cases, although there are times where i will feel alone and in need of socializing or at the very least the company of other people. i find that there needs to be a balance of some sort for me and that balance is a central theme to my life.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\ni do not currently partake/enjoy in anything outdoorsy and never have sports-wise either, mainly just those of a indoor nature. i like to write poetry and lyrics, cook, read YA literature and others\u2019 poetry as well as philosophy/self-help books, and indulge in my spirituality in addition to studying astrology to better understand myself.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\ni can be curious, but most times not to the point of outwardly asking questions due to my social anxiety. i like to contemplate a multitude of things such as myself, my feelings (i have a hard time regulating and identifying them due to the ADHD), and existentialistic topics. i\u2019m oftentimes curious over how certain things function, how things came to be actualized in our reality, and over the behaviors/psychology of other individuals. my ideas tend to be conceptual\u2014 they typically revolve around more abstract and less tangible aspects of life. they make me feel crazy at times because they\u2019re not exactly your average joe\u2019s ways of thinking, and i often am reserved when sharing these ideas in fear of ridicule or misunderstanding.\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nno, i\u2019ve always pegged myself more as a follower than a leader (despite what my astrological birth chart says). i have too many insecurities to be good at it right now but if i were to be a leader, i\u2019d imagine my style would be compassionate and oriented towards what\u2019s best for the collective greater good, probably as long as it doesn\u2019t involve a loved one of mine too deeply.\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\ni\u2019m more clumsy than anything\u2014 my mind also has a predilection for being scattered with a patchy memory to boot. i like working with my hands occasionally, but i don\u2019t use them as often as i would like to. if i did, i\u2019d imagine myself making jewelry, painting, drawing, making cosplay, and cooking more intensively.\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\ni do consider myself artistic; my art can he abstract but can and has also invoked emotion within others. i do more appreciating than creating nowadays, but i wish to change that soon. i enjoy art that speaks to me on a spiritual level, art that makes me feel (and think things but more so feel), and art that inspires me.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\ni think both the past and future are illusions\u2014 they don\u2019t technically exist unless you give them the power to, and what we really only have is the present. i follow eckhart tolle\u2019s teachings on \u2018the power of now,\u2019 which state that time is a restraint and what eludes us from the truth that is the power in the present.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nnot necessarily, although i do think it can and does help. but ultimately i do not think as if everything needs logic assigned to it. i believe i lead more with my heart rather than my head.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\ni recognize that they are significant to reach goals, but i unfortunately am not as productive as i would like to be. if things do not require much effort at their core unless its to improve how others perceive me and to show off my creativity, then i am less inclined to expend it.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nmy hobbies are gaming, reading, writing, learning, divination, singing, songwriting, watching (contemporary, horror, fantasy, sci-fi) cinematography or anime, and exploring my surroundings when i feel safe enough or in the mood to do so. i like these hobbies because they help give me a sense of purpose in life and they keep me busy. they help shape who i am in a way, though i do also acknowledge that they do not entirely shape me.\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nmy learning style is linguistic and visual, and i struggle the most with solely auditory learning. i\u2019ve struggled with the average learning environment due to america\u2019s unfavorable education system for those with ADHD-PI. i prefer classes that involve my creativity the most because i value expression of self.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\ni am not remarkably good at strategizing. i usually get overwhelmed by the entirety of a project and thus procrastinate lmfao, but i try to break up projects into manageable tasks when i can. i don\u2019t improvise often but i do wing projects sometimes if instructions aren\u2019t clear to me.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nmy professional aspiration is to make a career/living out of singing and songwriting and personally-speaking, it would be to reach some level of spiritual enlightenment, find true love, and live the best life i can with what\u2019s at my disposal.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\ni fear others\u2019 perceptions of me being less than favorable. or for others to see me as a nuisance or dumb. i fear not being competent enough for society. people prying into my personal life or imposing their beliefs onto me make me uncomfortable. i hate being ignored due to my rejection sensitive dysphoria, and i hate narrow-mindedness and bigotry of any kind because i value acceptance and knowledge. i hate being a bother to others as well because i don\u2019t want to be perceived that way.\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni am not particularly attached to reality; i (maladaptively) daydream very often on a daily basis. i am not usually aware of my surroundings as well.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nfor important decisions, they can take me a very long time depending on the severity of significance. i try my best not to change my mind once i\u2019ve settled on something, so it rarely happens.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nprocessing my emotions take me a long while typically; they are integral to my being and i still don\u2019t understand them very well. they can control my life sometimes and i often bottle them up.\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nyes, more often than i would like to admit. i am just not confident in my argumentative abilities and i fear not articulating my points well enough as well as the pressure of time.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\ni\u2019m not a big rule-breaker and i believe authority knows better most of the time, but i also believe it is up to everyone\u2019s discretion whether they truly know better or not. it\u2019s a case-by-case basis i suppose.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.014944313}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.8155613}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -5.069195}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -7.9505386}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -10.255753}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -10.88349}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -11.956675}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -12.419802}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -12.79158}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -12.798944}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -13.000347}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -13.032999}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -13.52894}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.802246}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -13.884579}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -14.006271}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -14.187948}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -14.49715}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -14.499517}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -14.53945}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.00013977377}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -9.286109}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -10.690621}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -11.6162195}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.990994}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -13.275559}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -13.3527}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -13.908317}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -14.046115}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -14.064641}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -14.391013}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -14.473836}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -15.693849}, {"token": "_F", "logprob": -15.795972}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -15.822946}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -16.196537}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -16.386967}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -16.38797}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -16.543777}, {"token": "***", "logprob": -16.576889}]}}

{"submission": "I have been typed as Estp/isfj/infp/infj/eii/IEI. By various paid face to face videos. When I was with my ex on holiday caught him glancing at a girl and from then on made me really insecure I just would cry even when we were walking outside yes he was an asshole and that\u2019s y is an ex. I went into a job not doing much research into it even tho I thought i did and now regret my life choices but too lazy to go back to school to do anything else. I lived with my mum all my life and when she went on holiday I found it kinda hard to do everything and was kinda stressed. Found out that I would be making coffee and forgot about the coffee until later and it was all cold. I would read manga and stay up all night coz kept on saying to myself just one more chapter etc and then suddenly it\u2019s like 6am. \n\nWhen I was young I thought my mum and aunty were all the people in sailor moon maybe coz I watched too much tv I also thought my mum was a spy maybe coz I watched Kim possible. \n\nI generally don\u2019t like myself as a person I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a kind person. I wish I could go back in time and change choices that I made. I like to fantasise about living another life. I think I had a dream before which was so good I wished I never woke up. Ohh no when I fantasise it\u2019s usually like when I m in bed and should be sleeping. \n\nI used to stare at the sun when I was in the car as a child but I don\u2019t remember exactly why but I have a feeling it\u2019s coz I thought I was special or something. I think it took me a while to grow up compared to other people like I am only now realising reality when before I think I had some sort of god complex maybe I still do abit now. Also one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like myself. I used to move from schools to schools in different countries and in most schools I was quiet and shy and only in one school I went to I was truly happy. I hated when teachers and adults would say I was shy as if it was a bad thing also I felt like it inhibited me and if I was seen as  this then I would need to be shy. I really hated it. \n\nWhen I was in secondary school I was abit delusional and even tho I was in a maths top class I made my answers all wrong as I would drop into a lower grade and then I regretted it. For some reason I think I thought it was cool or something. I don\u2019t remember exactly why.

{"submission": "So, I don't think I've done this before on Reddit, but this was my last resort since quizzes/tests don't really help me. (I just put my answers for that pinned post.)\n\n1. I'm only 13 years old, and I'm a female. I don't think I have much to say about myself, but I'm kind of mature for my age and I often don't talk a lot IRL because I find it hard to get the words out of my mouth easily unless I've rehearsed, or something. \n2. None that I'm aware of.\n3. My family isn't the most religious family on Earth, but they still do believe in God (we're Catholic). We go to church seldomly, like maybe a few times a month or when we have time to. If we're really busy, then we just light those candles. But I don't really have any faith in God. Like, I know that there must be a being that created the world but I don't practice any religious stuff unless my family wants to.\n4. I'm just a student and I don't really like it because of the schedule.\n5. An entire weekend by myself sounds interesting actually! Maybe I'd be refreshed for the first few days but would get anxious after that. I've always enjoyed being by myself most of the time (especially at home), but definitely not for a week.\n6. The activities I do don't require much physical work since I just lie down and play video games if I'm not busy with schoolwork. I do want to get into sports though, specifically soccer (even joined my school's football team for some sports festival). As for that, I sometimes play badminton outside, but only when someone asks me to play with them.\n7. I don't think I'm that curious, though people think I am. The word \"Why?\" comes out of my mouth a lot, at least. I do have a lot of ideas but I don't end up executing them unless I'm in the right mood/it's easy. I get curious about random stuff, really, but I don't pry whenever it's a serious or personal matter. Most of my curiosities are conceptual because I'm not so in touch with the environment.\n8. Taking on a leadership position is fine with me, though I wouldn't be the best at it. I'm definitely organized when delegating tasks and doing the project itself, but decision-making is kinda hard for me since I always get pressured to make the right decision. It usually takes me a while to make a decision and when I do make a decision, I change my mind a few minutes later. \n9. I'd like to think I'm coordinated. Some say I have a good reaction time, which I think is coordinated enough. I'm not sure what to put here though since I barely do any physical activity, lol.\n10. I'm not artistic, I just have the ideas. I think of an artwork/a story I wanna write but I never execute it because I'm not good at drawing or writing. \n11. I want to see myself as an \"I don't care about the past\" person, but I am. I always worry about stuff that's already happened and I'm cautious about not making those mistakes again (but I still do, sometimes). My head is always in the future too. I always think about what I should major in, what career path I should take, how I'll save my money once I do get a job... stuff like that. As for the present, I don't think about it much. I think I'm too worried about the past and the future that I tend to forget about the present.\n12. If someone asks for help then I'd first think if I am able to help them. If it's a small task or a task that I can certainly do, then of course I'd help them. If it's a more difficult task that I can't do/wouldn't bother doing, I'd politely tell them that I can't help.\n13. I do. I'm not that logical most of the time and I'm definitely not consistent (unless it's academics), so I also don't have logical consistency. \n14. Being efficient is definitely satisfying for me. Being able to take two birds down with one stone is enjoyable, but I don't think about it too much.\n15. I find myself unconsciously controlling others sometimes, and it's always for my benefit too. I'm not sure how or why I do it though, sorry.\n16. I don't have many hobbies aside from singing and playing video games. I enjoy playing video games with friends and many people have said that I'm good at singing so I keep doing it.\n17. I learn the most by repeatedly reading/saying something out loud since it helps me memorize the most. A learning style I struggle with the most though is listening (especially during online classes) since I have the attention span of a frog. I have to really force myself to listen so I can actually do that. I prefer classes that have memorization since I'm good at recalling and memorizing things, whether it be a poem, a statement, or a set of words.\n18. It takes me a while to strategize since I always consider the effort it'll take. Like I said before, I'm pretty good at delegating tasks equally. Improvisation is something I'm decent at, but I don't exactly use that method when it comes to strategizing.\n19. Be rich, be cool, get a lover. My aspirations are very simple and I'm not very ambitious.\n20. I have this weird fear of not belonging and getting left out. I always worry whether my friends don't actually want me to be in their friend group, or if they have a separate GC that I'm not in. It's stupid. Blatant racism, homophobia, misogyny, and people pointing out my flaws are the things that make me uncomfortable. I especially hate it when people point out an insecurity out loud and judge someone for that insecurity. I myself have a lot of insecurities (mostly about my physical appearance) so I don't like it when someone judges another unless it's justified.\n21. I sadly not have reached a \"high\" in my life yet. I don't want to say that I do since I'm still young and there's really not much I'm very passionate about.\n22. I think the \"lows\" in my life was the time I actually considered suicide. I was home alone and was crying my eyes out, literally about to drink bleach. I had to talk to an AI bot since I don't feel comfortable on finding comfort in actual people.\n23. I do daydream often. Whenever I do, I get kind of out of it, but I'm still partially aware of my surroundings. \n24. I would just lay down and start thinking about whatever, really. Multiple thoughts come into my mind, no matter how normal or personal it may be. I could start off thinking about what I want to eat, then suddenly reflect on my entire life, and then start to think about the future, then I'd think about life after death, then back to what I want to eat.\n25. People don't give me an opportunity to make an important decision because I take far too long to do so. When I do make an important decision, I start to second guess and then change it. It's pretty annoying, even to me.\n26. I don't think about my emotions too often and if I do, I don't do much about it. Like, if I'm sad and I know that, I would just try to distract myself until it becomes too overwhelming. Emotions are important to me, but I don't do anything about mine at all.\n27. I don't do that a lot. I have my own opinions and principles, so if the person I'm talking to doesn't respect that, then they aren't worth talking to. I wouldn't ridicule them for having their own opinion (unless it's something VERY PROBLEMATIC) so I expect them to do the same to me.\n28. I don't break the rules often unless I have to. Normally, I would say no, but the authority in my country right now and how the government operates is actually ridiculous. Sure, they would definitely know more than a 13-year-old girl who doesn't go outside, but the decisions some authorities make are becoming too inconsiderate and illogical right now.

{"submission": "Soft spoken the majority of the time but around certain people they can be chatty, can fake their excitement/extroversion if they\u2019re tired but don\u2019t want to make the person they\u2019re with feel bad. In a group they find themselves wondering what other people are thinking, and with every decision they make they consider how it\u2019ll impact the people involved, sometimes more than how the decision could benefit or affect themselves. they can do small talk (but don\u2019t enjoy it nearly as much as deeper conversations) but tend to talk more and go into more detail if it is a deeper conversation, they love to talk about things that would take most people a long time to bring up. They\u2019ve been described as humble and and very kind, and gift gifts to the people they love, but are also described as extremely introverted and quiet by other people. Most people describe them as kind but some have described them as a hard person to truly get to know, and someone who is sensitive and does not like being controlled. However, even when they are being controlled or mistreated, they tend to forgive the person who\u2019s manipulating them and stay despite being mistreated, because they still manage to see the \u201cgood\u201d in them. Avoid conflict at all costs, will go out of their way to avoid conflict, but when it comes to someone else they will fight fiercely to protect the other person and have no problem taking on whoever and whatever the problem is. People, sometimes strangers, open up to them easily and tell them things for no reason, out of no where, things that are deeply personal. They put others needs before their own, to the point they don\u2019t know who they are or what they want anymore, and have surprisingly weak boundaries. People have told them that they have a way of knowing what someone is going to say before they say it, some people find that unsettling. They\u2019re optimistic and love humanity most of the time, but also have trouble truly trusting other people, and can find themselves expecting the worst out of a situation and questioning other people\u2019s intentions. They\u2019ve frequently had hunches about people within the first few moments of meeting them that tend to be correct, they describe it as a feeling and say \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong, I know it. Something about so and so is off.\u201d And find themselves reading the persons body language, and eyes most of all, and are skilled at recognizing changes in the body language and incredibly good and reading someone\u2019s eyes. They\u2019ve been right about people being bad/not good people even if everyone around tells them that it\u2019s nonsense, and no one takes them seriously until they themselves see what this person sees. They love to learn things, crave adventure, something exciting. They are also described as lost in thought a lot, can be caught staring at a wall for minutes a time, listening to music and just thinking and or daydreaming. They\u2019re often the therapist of the friend group, and enjoy being able to listen to other people and help them with their issues, but can get burnt out easily and lash out if they take on other peoples problems too much. People pleaser tendencies, can have a bit of a savior complex at times, gets a little upset if their care for other people goes unappreciated. Overthinks chronically, wondering if anything they just said or did upset someone. Can have an all or nothing mentality sometimes.

Te?)\n\n- I'm always speaking with myself in my head, even when outside with my friends, feels like my mind is in the moment but also far away at the same time, also, silly thing but I can sometimes find myself randomly assigning meanings and metaphors to random objects like \"oh the water left in this cup kinda represents bla bla in life\", honestly it's a lil silly but wanted to mention it either way (Ni? Ne?)\n\n- I don't find myself wanting a lot of things tbh and if I do, it's not strongly, I can even be hesitant a lot of times thinking and researching about what is the best option (Lack of Ni?)\n\n- I love writing stories in my head including plot, setting, theme and characters I personalize and design (Ne?)\n\n- I live in the present and rarely think about the past or the future (with few exceptions) I dislike thinking about the past especially, even if it's good memories or nostalgia (Se?)\n\n- I often focus on my surroundings and body movements when I'm outside (Se?)\n\n- I seek attention subtly but when I get it, I dislike it and try to avoid it, then I seek it again (Yes, I'm a retard)\n\n- My memory is actually terrible unless I really care, fish memory you may call it, especially with remembering numbers or dates (Lack of Si?)\n\n- I actually suck at getting things done unless I REALLY have to OR want to, I get distracted from the main task easily and I can't keep my motivation for long periods (Lack of Te?)\n\n- I can be really impulsive sometimes\n\n- I am introverted most of the time but I can get really talkative and louder than extroverts with the right company and time, I always enjoy hanging out but I don't actively look for it and can sometimes avoid it if I'm feeling lazy (Ennegram 7?)\n\n- I actually prefer things being simple and clear, I really hate complexity (except for deep meanings) and would often choose a simple and direct choice (this can be seen as being stupid cause I think smart people wouldn't mind tackling complex stuff)\n\n- However, I've been called smart and/or wise by people before including close friends, girlfriend, family and strangers, of course it's not necessarily true though\n\n- I can get really arguementive sometimes, and really unbothered and uncaring some other times \n\n- I can get sensitive in the wrong times and insensitive in the right times (Fi? Lack of Fi?)\n\n- I hate philosophy but I can get philosophical accidentally when my mind wanders off or when I'm advicing or helping a friend\n\n- My self-esteem is randomized, sometimes I feel cocky (but I never show it and always try to stay humble), othertimes I feel like the lowest of the low (but I never show it and always try to not appear self-hating, unless I let it slip)\n\n- I'm polite with strangers but can sometimes misbehave in public if I get lost in the moment\n\n- Undiagnosed but I think I MAY have ADHD and Bipolarity, I display the symptoms sometimes but it's just a maybe\n\nThat's it for now because it's gotten way longer than I attended, sorry about that but if you made it till the end, thank you, I really appreciate your effort and caring and I would love to hear what you think no matter how trivial or unrelated it is, thanks again", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": "ISFP", "logprobs": {"IS": [{"token": "IS", "logprob": -0.19889703}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.9397417}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -5.243035}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -5.38073}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.402741}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -5.441342}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.468083}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -5.5032487}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.7785783}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.109616}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.2510304}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -7.7906117}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -8.510146}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.567658}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -8.573474}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -8.5967245}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -8.811084}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -9.06103}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -9.177627}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -9.282643}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0006120019}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -8.250057}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -8.498901}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.902452}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -12.658848}, {"token": "Fx", "logprob": -13.047888}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -13.277954}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.606373}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -14.38673}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -14.796528}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -15.05835}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -15.646412}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -15.885918}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -16.65316}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -16.757845}, {"token": "PP", "logprob": -16.803602}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -16.816801}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -16.984926}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -17.057907}, {"token": "NP", "logprob": -17.179361}]}}

{"submission": "I was given a funny exercice in class. Our teacher gave us an almond and asked us to look at it for 5 minutes.\n\nAt first I was wondering what was the point of the exercice. I was not really focused on the almond. I was looking around to see if other people were as confused as me, how they were reacting. Then I decided to try the exercice. I looked at the almond from far then took it in my hand to analyze it closer. I noticed it had a lot of stripes and I wondered why it was the case, why they were formed that way.\n\nOur teacher also said these specific almonds came from Spain instead of the US, so then I asked myself where almonds were originally from. I thought they grew in Europe, but were they originally from America like potatoes ? Then I remembered I liked almond milk but had never eaten a \u201craw almond\u201d before.\n\nAt the end of the 5 minutes, we had to share our thoughts. Some people said they were thinking of what they could do with almonds (aka looking for a practical use like baking a cake). Some people played with it, observed it, threw it on the table, licked it. Some other were thinking of how they really liked the taste of almonds.

{"submission": "so, i\u2019ve been stuck on my type for a while, i\u2019ve jumped from type to type all over the place and it\u2019s really chaotic lol. i can\u2019t identify the cognitive functions that i use within myself for the life for me, and it\u2019s like the different aspects of myself and my identity get all mushed together, making it hard to pick out a clear picture of myself. so, i\u2019m going to give a basic rundown of myself here, and i\u2019d much appreciate if anyone chips in at all. any typology system is accepted by the way, but i\u2019d obviously prefer mbti. also, quick side note, i\u2019ve been diagnosed with autism, and it is quite possible that there are other diagnoses that fit me. so just keep that in mind when reading through. \n\n-i love just simply having a good time. fun is pretty much my main goal in life. \n-i\u2019ve always been intellectually inclined to a certain extent. i spent much of my childhood researching. \n-music is like, my favourite thing in the world. i listen to it all the time, and generally have a varied, diverse taste. i don\u2019t really care whether other people like it or not. \n-i minimize worrying on things that don\u2019t matter, (or that i deem as such), but what does matter, i will worry about extensively until there\u2019s reason to stop. \n-writing has always really resonated with me, i love it so much and it\u2019s possibly my most honed skill. from possibly the age of 8, i\u2019ve been regarded as a writer, and a good one at that. i write poems that teachers grade an A/A+ with ease, and my written explanations for assignments usually carry my mark. \n-reading actually good books has also almost always been a hobby of mine. \n-when i\u2019m stressed out, what will happen is i get this feeling where it\u2019s like i just can\u2019t work. my brain goes into this mode where it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s become an overrun computer, and to try to access it is.. something else. i get this feeling yearly with school, but it\u2019s not usually until later in the year. this year, it\u2019s already happening. i have no idea if that has to do anything with anything, but thought i\u2019d add that little tidbit in there.\n-sometimes i just absorb things, almost like a sponge. it\u2019s like i don\u2019t think and am just experiencing sometimes. \n-while i can be more extroverted, i won\u2019t talk much around people that don\u2019t really interest me. i\u2019d also much rather just do stuff then talk. i way rather experience than just talk/think about it. \n-i become obsessed with the things that i like. it\u2019s usually a very intense thing, and then fades away after not very long. it\u2019s like i just jump from thing to thing.\n-i like writing pieces that explain things in tons of detail. i want the reader to be able to feel and see the experience of what\u2019s going on in what i write, and this is my preferred style of literature as well.\n-i\u2019ve been typed as fi dom a TON, but i\u2019m not sure whether i agree with that or not. lots of the time it feels like i don\u2019t know myself very well, and emotions can stress me out. \n-i really appreciate aesthetic/fashion sense, and going on throughout life according to what i choose, i create a sort of preferred self-image and wardrobe in my head. \nthis is all i\u2019m going to put here for now!

{"submission": "So I've gotten into MBTI for a while now but I still can't figure out my type. I will put in a description about myself and I hope somebody will be able to type me!\n\nI am generally a quiet person and prefer to work by myself. I don't like talking a lot but if somebody starts a topic thats really interesting to me, I end up blabbering about it for half an hour. I'm really outgoing around my friends and like to entertain them, but in general I do not like it when everybody is paying attention at me. I have a hard time expressing my thoughts with people, as they are really complicated. I think a lot to myself about all the possibilities that could happen, and I tend to analyze people a lot. I am often detached from the outside world and get lost in my imaginary world. I get bored easily and start daydreaming about scenarios that I wish could happen. I am a creative person, I like to implement my imagination in real life, but a lot of the time I find myself procrastinating/having no energy to actually start a project or something. I tend to see many of the people around me as dumb for being illogical and not thinking outside the box. I lose patience with those who cannot keep up with me and get mad. I've never been an overly emotional person, I usually keep all my emotions to myself. If I'm angry at someone, I barely express it. I also think with my head instead of my heart. I always try to find the most logical solution in every problem. Usually, I don't like hanging out with many friends all at once, and I like to only spend time with one close friend. For memories, I always recall past events and memories when something happens, using past experience to guide me in the present. Please tell me if i need to add more info.

{"submission": "\n\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n31, man, enjoy going to the gym, computers, analytical stuff, currently overweight and going back to the gym and getting on a diet. I used to powerlift. \n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nOCD and ASD\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nPretty introverted. Was called the class clown. I was strictly religious. At first I thought it was silly then I really got into it. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nLast job was a software engineer. I didn't like it because it was too hard, even though I was good at it.  \n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI usually spend most weekend by myself or with my girlfriend. It's an occasion when I spend time with friends or have someone over. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like playing guitar, I'm not good at sports per se, especially team sports, but I'm decent at disc golf. I used to snowboard every weekend growing up and picked it up insanely quickly, but never got over the hump of intermediate-ish skill.  \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm very curious. I have many great ideas but don't usually follow up on them. My ideas are usually about new careers or apps to build. Almost all conceptual.  \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI used to lead projects in school because I felt that if I didn't, I would fall behind or not get a good grade. I was a bit of a diplomat and wanted to make everyone happy but actually completing the job we were assigned was my top priority. I think I would be an okay leader because I want to get things done without anything extra that would take time away from the essentials. \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI sometimes have reflexes like Spiderman. I feel overall that I'm not coordinated, but not clumsy. \n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI'm pretty poetic, I can paint a little bit at an elementary level, I like playing piano when I get a chance. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past haunts me. I feel like mistakes I've made are the worst thing ever. The present is okay, I don't spend much time here. The future is full of opportunities but i dont often seem to get there. \n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI usually help because if I asked for help, I would like help. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes I do. \n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nPretty important. \n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nYes. It's mostly subconscious because I want to feel needed. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nSolving puzzles. It gives me some brain stimulation. \n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMostly by doing. I struggle with verbal instructions. Memorization yes, logic yes, creativity and physical senses no. \n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI wing projects and improvise as I go. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally, I just want to be really good at something. Personally, I want to have good relationships. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear being singled out and told I suck or am bad at something. Confrontation makes me uncomfortable. I hate arguing because it makes me uncomfortable. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nBeing in good relationships. Having people that love an support me. Having career success.  \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nLosing friends. Being an outsider. \n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nNot very attached to reality. I daydream often. I'm aware of my surroundings while I daydream to a degree. \n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI'd probably freak out thinking I'm the only one left on earth. How do I get out of here?\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI often make instant decisions then change my mind when more information comes in. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nVery long. They are important but not something I'm often aware of until i stop and digest. \n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going?

{"submission": "I\u2019ve been on the fence abt whether if I\u2019m an INTP or ISTP. Any advices on which one I can be? \n\nHere\u2019s a bit about me & what others say about me:\n\nMultiple professors have told me that I am very quiet, but very thoughtful. All of my critiques of others art pieces have been helpful and to the core (I attend an art school and critiques of everyone\u2019s work is a daily thing). A specific professor have also told me that she likes how I take a very intuitive approach to building my artwork, having an abstract idea and building my way up in an unconventional way.\n\nBecause my focus is in the arts, I\u2019ll be mostly talking in context of my work style in art. When I am given a topic to work on, my first thought is for it to be telling a story in a way that is not direct. It has to tell something, no matter what it is, but I will never present my idea on a silver platter for my audience. My process in creating the artwork, if I am proceeding with a technique I am not familiar with, I start off with what I know onto a path that I will figure out myself- I don\u2019t like to be constrained to a certain way of doing things, even if it might be the best way (Like sewing on wire, building a chair out of brittle sticks, etc\u2026 All sorts of concepts that I want to experiment on, that I somehow have a certain confidence will work out - though sometimes it doesn\u2019t). \n\nI work very differently when creating art compared to when I write essays. When creating art I am obsessed with the unconventional and the novel. But when writing things like essays I prefer to stick to a certain way of writing that makes sense - it\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t like to make something unique, but to me writing is something that is either comprehensible or not, and the most general must be the most understandable.

{"submission": "More details in the comments. \n\n\n1) 16F\n\n2) I have always prided myself in being caring and kind to others. People always tell me how kind I am, and sometimes people even say I am the kindest person ever. This made me aspire to be deemed as the kindest person in the world when I was 11 years old, and I literally went around helping people in order to gain their approval. I still cringe about my attitude back then. This was something that I only did back then, and I only did that when I was 11 years old. \n\n3) when I was a kid, I was never organised. Seriously. I just wanted to do whatever I felt like doing. Though it is true that I have never been a risk-taker, and I only engaged in simple yet productive/fruitful activities like listening to music, writing, reading and so much more. Now, i am a very rigid person as i plan in my head the things I have to do during the day. It\u2019s almost a natural process for me to plan out what I want to do. Maybe I also did that as a kid too? \n\n4) I am rather sentimental. I love the feeling of nostalgia as a look back on my past memories. Reminiscing used to be one of my favourite hobbies. Now, my life is much more hectic, so I rarely have the time to reminisce fully. When reminiscing. I dont get the same nostalgia that I used to have, which honestly alarms me to a degree. I guess it\u2019s a sign that I\u2019m changing\u2026why is that alarming too? \n\n5) I hate taking risks. HATE it. The thought that I may DIE while doing the thrilling activity just irks me. I also dont Like Doing things like guessing what topic May come out in a test, or not studying a chapter before a test. I always prepare as much as possible to avoid any bad consequences. I also used to hate teasing or pranking my friends as I absolutely do not want to hurt their feelings and (esp) make them mad, leading to a conflict that I have to navigate through and stress about. I fear that things will end up rough between me and my friend, and end up stressing/catastrophising excessively as a result of it. I can only calm down once things go back to normal. \n\n6) I constantly need validation from others. Whether be it compliments, words of encouragement or approval of a decision, I constantly used to chase after my friends\u2019 opinions. I may be much more independent now, but I subconsciously still seek it. I just need some reassurance that I am indeed a good person, that I am indeed beautiful and that (esp for now) the decisions I make are reasonable and aren\u2019t stupid. When it comes to making decisions though, I am still more inclined to making them on my own. I just need validation from my friends, that\u2019s all. \n\n7) when someone criticises me, I have mixed reactions. I can get very defensive about those criticisms, and I can even start analysing each piece criticism my friends gave me in order to rebut/make sense of them. I even try to recall if their criticism 100% matches what I remember. I can be very hurt about it and May even question my self-worth as a result of it. One time, a friend of mine hurled insults at me, and soon my whole friend group left me. As a result, I kept wondering if I am truly worthy of having friends and if I am actually a good friend or not. I kept thinking that I am a toxic person to others and am someone who hurts people\u2019s feelings/someone who people disapprove of. I started to question if any of my friends view me as a good person. I even questioned if I am special to them/if they prefer others over me (admittedly I have the desire to be #1 to others). \n\n8) I have grown to become a rather objective and rational person. I try to use my logic than my emotions when it comes to making decisions, and I even try to use logic to understand things. I especially enjoy creating insights that are unique from others\u2019, as well as making connections between ideas in order to understand a concept better. It\u2019s always an internal process though, and the moment I try to verbalise my thoughts, my insights become marred with logical fallacies. \n\n9) I have always been a perfectionist. I zoom in on the details and try to make things perfect. This especially applies to myself. I have always been strict with myself about my English. I need it to be coherent and perfect. I assess my ability and progress in English - and actually anything - with my past memories.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": "INFJ", "logprobs": {"INF": [{"token": "INF", "logprob": -0.64757794}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.1089771}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -2.5865333}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -3.5174873}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.959977}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -4.4486146}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.4760594}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.410088}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -6.566605}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.082728}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.590552}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.8706784}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -8.281083}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.730571}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -8.792035}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.809949}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -8.894774}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -9.043527}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -9.175811}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.380506}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -1.9816675e-06}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.564798}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -14.736443}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -15.824923}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -16.815666}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -17.367775}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -18.625235}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -18.703714}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -18.86867}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -19.016428}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -19.196741}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -19.266775}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -19.402264}, {"token": "JS", "logprob": -19.747128}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -19.899017}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -19.962372}, {"token": "JJ", "logprob": -19.974968}, {"token": "JI", "logprob": -20.291655}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -20.390074}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -20.41157}]}}

Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI like to teach myself concepts through YouTube because I find that most teachers don't do the best job. I love it when I can just figure out a rule and apply it, or memorize it. I don't love very logic-intensive theoretical math classes but I do love solving math problems quickly and just getting the correct answer. I don't like learning random information either that feels unnecessary. I don't really engage with my physical senses when I'm learning and learning something physical, such as driving, is 100% so much harder for me than just memorizing a history lesson. \n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nDefinitely. I have always loved drawing and painting since a young age. I'm also developing an interest in writing, which I consider an art form. Most of my paintings are attempts at realism and depict either myself or my family members. My study notes are kind of an art form too since I have very neat handwriting and enjoy making calligraphic titles. I am an avid appreciator of art too: I adore anything from the Renaissance to Impressionism. \n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past is something for me to learn from, and reflect on: unfortunately, it's easier for me to remember bad memories from the past. I have trouble keeping perspective in the present and often things seem to be brighter in the future. I have many goals and aspirations for the future. I used to have my entire medical career path planned out, but now I am unsure if I want to pursue medicine. \n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI usually try to help others fix problems if I know I have past experience, the skills, or the knowledge to do so. My thought process is I'm capable, so why not just help someone move past this problem? If someone I am close with asks for help, I will do so out of my own affection for them. \n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI'm not truly sure what this means but I do value doing things because they make sense. I don't see the point in putting in work into something for example, if it isn't logically the correct course of action. \n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nVery important. I have many goals and an overloaded schedule. Without efficiency and productivity, I would not be able to get what I want. I sometimes do procrastinate but nowhere near the levels of true procrastinators. My sister is an ESTJ and I admire how hard she always works: we both have different work routines and systems that we have catered to ourselves. \n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don't believe that I control others directly, however, people often open up to me for no apparent reason and I question why I have all this information about them. \n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI love reading, watching TV shows, painting, listening to music, playing board games, and occasionally writing. They just spark creativity, logic, or emotion. \n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI like to teach myself concepts through YouTube because I find that most teachers don't do the best job. I love it when I can just figure out a rule and apply it, or memorize it. I don't love very logic-intensive theoretical math classes but I do love solving math problems quickly and just getting the correct answer. I don't like learning random information either that feels unnecessary. I don't really engage with my physical senses when I'm learning and learning something physical, such as driving, is 100% so much harder for me then just memorizing a history lesson. \n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI usually make a rough plan on when I'm going to work on a project and write down my daily tasks in a planner. I don't make a step-by-step plan because I know I won't stick to it and I hate breaking down tasks. I'm usually an all-or-nothing person, so I just sit down and work until I'm finished. \n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI hate failure - it's my worst fear and the hardest thing to get over. I've been told I have a high ego and can't take criticism from people I love sometimes because I hate disappointing myself and others. Sensory intensive experiences with strangers like doctor's appointments make me uncomfortable. \n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nI feel calm and act logically. I'm productive and not on my phone.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nBinging junk food, procrastinating, using social media way too much, feeling empty or very insecure about everything. \n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI'm fairly attached to reality in that I don't daydream about surrealistic topics. I do think and reflect a lot on things that have happened or will happen in the future. I usually stare out a window or at one specific point when I do this. \n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nUsually, I have a gut feeling when I need to make a decision, but I do think about the decision fully before making it by weighing the pros and cons. I rarely change my mind or have regrets. \n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI find myself reflecting on my behavior a lot and I'm very self-regulatory. Emotions are a part of me but I don't make decisions based on them: I just acknowledge that I have certain emotional reactions to things and I learn from those experiences. \n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nOnly if they are an authoritative figure (like a teacher I can't piss off) or if I simply don't feel like fighting someone. Otherwise, I will make it known that I disagree if I do.

{"submission": " I already have a good idea of what my type is, I just wanted to see if anyone else can possibly make any assumptions. This was written a couple of months ago.  \n**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI\u2019m an 18 year old girl. I\u2019m what someone would call an ambivert, but I really don\u2019t like using that term as everyone technically requires social interaction and alone time. I\u2019m more of an extrovert with huge NPC energy due to my terrible social anxiety.\n\nI have been told that I am ambitious, well-rounded, opinionated, creative and smart, but also arrogant, argumentative, and stubborn.\n\nI\u2019m very quiet normally, I mind my own business. When I\u2019m with my friends, I\u2019m super chatty and weird.\n\nI have been typed as an ExTx 3w2, but I\u2019m leaning towards ExTJ because of the fact that I prioritize Te over Fi.\n\n16p and those other tests that disguise themselves as cognitive function tests (which they are not- they prioritize letter dichotomies and then use the functions as part of the description later) have typed me as an IxTX.\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI\u2019ve had a depressive episode during late 2020-early 2022. Because of that, I have been diagnosed with depression. As of now, however, I am doing fine.\n\nAs a kid, I\u2019ve almost been diagnosed with ADHD because I did really badly during school. Turns out I was doing bad at school because I didn\u2019t care at the time. I\u2019ve also been diagnosed with generalised anxiety recently, and I suppose it makes sense, due to how fricken stressed out I am.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy mom\u2019s religious and it drives me nuts- not because she\u2019s religious, but because of the stupid shit she says. She\u2019s homophobic, racist, sexist, whatever you name it. She doesn\u2019t like it when I eat meat on a friday, and she uses God as a threat, saying that \u201cGod is watching you\u201d and that \u201cGod will punish you.\u201dMy dad just exists? Idk. I hang out with my cats more :)))\n\nI don\u2019t remember much from my childhood other than being bullied at school and being hit at home. I was a mixture of being bossy, hyperactive and arrogant as a kid, but all of that has toned down A LOT as an older teenager.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI\u2019m studying Biomedical Engineering. It wasn\u2019t my first choice: my first choice was to become a doctor, but to be honest, I wasn\u2019t too interested in becoming one.\n\nI like my major because it combines both medicine and engineering. It is a developing field and I get to apply the stuff I learn. In the end, it\u2019s worth it.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI normally feel lonely, I don\u2019t realize it until much MUCH later. I mostly focus on completing work and doing my hobbies.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI\u2019m more on the artsy side. I like to draw, paint, read, write fanfics, and play the piano. I do workout though, it helps me maintain myself and I temporarily feel better.\n\nI am planning on using some of these hobbies as a side hustle- namely the art.\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI suppose I am curious? I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nI\u2019m not curious for the sake of being curious, I\u2019m curious because I think it would be useful, which is why I like STEM a lot- it\u2019s a genuine interest of mine, and it pays out in the end. I tended to dislike subjects like history, geography and english lit because I didn\u2019t have a use for it- I may not see the use for it, but if someone else does, that\u2019s fine.\n\nAs for my ideas to execution ratio, I would say they are the same. I do tend to execute most of my ideas, except for the ones with bad consequences. They\u2019re mostly conceptual? I don\u2019t focus on the environment or helping people out for the sake of making the world a better place.\n\nThe only ideas I can think about are hobbies related, namely because I\u2019m trying to survive in school and do my best. When it comes to my hobbies, mostly story writing, I try to make systems and write my own lore.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI would enjoy taking on a leadership position, and as a university student who\u2019s still trying to get out of the effects of a two and a half year pandemic, it\u2019s a little hard, but I enjoy it. With experience, I would be good at it. I would make sure people get their stuff done on time, while being fair - I don\u2019t wanna be the reason why people don\u2019t wanna go to work. That has happened to me before and it sucks.\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI guess I am coordinated lol\n\nI do play the piano, but I depend more on my memory, thus, I suck at sight-reading. As an engineering student, I\u2019ve only worked with my hands in my Electric Circuit Analysis class, and it was my favourite class despite the math getting complicated near the end of the course.\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI am artistic. I don\u2019t draw for the sake of expressing my emotions- I have done that once and felt really uncomfortable. \n\nI draw for the sake of expressing ideas- If I think something is cool, then I will draw it, which is why I draw characters from my favourite games a lot.\n\nI\u2019m more into sparkly, magic things IG.\n\nWhen it comes to traditional artwork, I don\u2019t like abstract art too much. I\u2019ve seen some pieces that make no sense. I\u2019m more into artwork that conveys meaning or fanart of my favourite characters.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI have to admit, my childhood was shit, so I don\u2019t really hold too much value of the past. The only value I have is from the lessons I\u2019ve learned (eg. grades don\u2019t indicate intelligence, being a dick isn\u2019t cool, etc\u2026).\n\nThe present is something I usually try to focus on? I usually plan out for the next week or whatever. I do have a 5 year plan but not all the details worked out. I\u2019m slightly sucky at long term planning and \u201cpredicting the future\u201d.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI usually help them without hesitation, mostly because they ask me for help at something I\u2019m good at. For example, during high school, I used to top my math and science classes, and people would ask me for help because of that. I don\u2019t mind, until they take advantage of me or just leave me to get help from someone else. I don\u2019t know why I help them, I just help them because they asked for it I guess.\n\nThe only time I don\u2019t help people is in an area I\u2019m unfamiliar with, in that case, I just send them away to find another person.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes. If something doesn\u2019t make sense, I won\u2019t care about it. That is why I hate my mom\u2019s stupid traditions and stuff.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nThese things are very important- they cut back a lot of unnecessary work. Whenever there is a task, I usually look for an easier way to do it, and I end up getting more work done for the same quality.\n\nOne thing I keep in mind is to study smart, not hard.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don\u2019t think I control others? At least, not that I know of.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m working on a group project for uni, I make sure everyone does their part- I don\u2019t know if that is considered controlling.\n\nEven if I were to control others, I wouldn\u2019t micromanage them - they need to be creative to some extent but also get the work done.\n\nThe only thing I do however, is to push people to live up to their potential and offer solutions as part of their problems.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nAs I said, my hobbies are more on the artsy side. I mainly use them as a destressor from my STEM heavy lifestyle, and also I think it\u2019s good to be well-rounded and have lots of hobbies.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nVisual-kinesthetic?? Idk.\n\nI\u2019ve heard students learn effectively from all three learning styles, and frankly, most of my learning has been visual up to now. Auditory learning isn\u2019t my style because all the info goes from one ear and out the other, and my memory is pretty shitty, but if I practiced it with the other two, it would be good.\n\nThe only reason why I\u2019m majoring in biomed. engineering was because I picked up some random anatomy books as a kid, thought it was cool, and did some totally (unrelated) science experiments. School was so boring as a kid, and I didn\u2019t do good until the 7th grade, because that\u2019s when they started looking at my grades for high school.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI normally strategize whenever I\u2019m faced with a task, and I would say I\u2019m good at it. The only time when I wing projects and improvise is when I don\u2019t care about so much - hence my terribly written, last minute essays for english class.\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI want to be successful, and most of all, remembered.\n\nMy goals involve: getting enough credentials to put on my resume during uni and after that (masters in engineering and also one in business administration, and possibly a phd), becoming a successful engineer, and making sure all my hard work pays off.\n\nI have a personal goal, and it is to become the best version of myself: The pandemic didn\u2019t account for much of that, and now that I\u2019m in uni, I\u2019m breaking out of my shell little by little.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI guess somebody taking advantage of me. I don\u2019t normally emote a lot because I don\u2019t want anyone to know how I\u2019m feeling. But it\u2019s kinda bad to the point I don\u2019t realize my own feelings have been hurt when someone offends me. One thing that makes me uncomfortable is talking to people on a personal level, I guess that\u2019s another reason why I didn\u2019t settle on becoming a doctor- these guys talk to a lot of people and comfort them and etc\u2026\n\nI hate not living up to my fullest potential- which explains why I felt like shit and developed depressing feelings during the pandemic. I also hate it when others don\u2019t live up to their potential, and I criticize them (not out loud).\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the highs in my life look like- maybe it\u2019s when I accomplish something. I have won multiple awards for piano, academics, and other smaller things. It\u2019s not in the form of awards, but also personal things, like artwork. I treat art like I do regular work, and after having artblock for so long, completing something is a great accomplishment.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe biggest low for me was the pandemic. According to my doctor, I was despondent, lazy, unmotivated, and very blue. I lost sight of my goals and ate a lot of food and felt really lonely.\n\nI actually mistyped as an INTP because of that.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI guess I\u2019m a mix of being a daydreamer and being realistic. The only occurrence of me being realistic happens in my academic life - I anticipated that engineering school would be tough, and it is. I remember our class had a discussion about our first semester of uni so far, and some kids were talking about romanticizing studying and all that stuff, and I was like, how?\n\nI daydream when I\u2019m at home: I like to create stories and stuff. I normally spend a decent amount of time daydreaming until I realize I\u2019m hungry or something.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nIn a worst case scenario, I would have an existential crisis - I don\u2019t like being alone with my thoughts for far too long. Otherwise, I would probably daydream. It would still be weird to not do anything.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nNot that long. When I make an important decision, it\u2019s because I know it will benefit me in the future, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t make the decision in the first place. I can\u2019t think of examples of me changing my mind, but granted, my memory is shit.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me a very long time to process them. Just last month, I dropped a friend. I was very pissed off around her, and I didn\u2019t know why. The final straw was when she was being really bossy when discussing course selection, and in the end, she told me to quit biomedical engineering in favour of software engineering because \u201cit\u2019s the future\u201d (which biomed is too). That\u2019s when I realized, wait, I thought i hated this girl cuz she\u2019s ugly or something, but now I realize that she\u2019s a jerk and I was pissed whenever she\u2019d open her mouth.\n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNot that I can think of. I try to keep the conversation flowing naturally regardless of any opposing opinions, it makes the conversation more organic and interesting. For example, a friend asked me if I watch the world cup, and I told her, I\u2019m not really into that.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI\u2019m mostly a rule follower, unless the rules are stupid. There was a rule about not having bags in the science classroom in highschool, and I remember going on a very long rant about it. The principal (who was new) had a good reason to not bring backpacks in because of labs.

{"submission": "(I go on a huge rant here; I don\u2019t really follow any structure or specific questions so if it\u2019s not specific enough to what mbti measures, just let me know and I\u2019ll delete it and answer some questions, thank youuuu)\n\nHey\u2026 I\u2019m 16, male\u2026 \n\nUmmmm, I like to write? Sometimes? I need to be in a pretty specific state though, and it\u2019s not a lovely one. Although I do live for it in a way? It\u2019s very intense\u2026 it\u2019s one where I wonder whether my love or anything I do matters and I always come to the conclusion that no, of course it doesn\u2019t. And I hate it, I want to rebel against it\u2026 like a man growing angry at their old age: their bones are more frail, muscles are not what they used to be and now they struggle to do what they used to enjoy\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the inevitable\u2026 it encapsulates me in so much beauty. Trying to swim against a tide\u2026 trying to claw your way out of the void\u2026\n\nThe agonising yet alluring idea that we were thrust into this world against our own will: we gazed into a well, not full of water, but full of abyss. And the figure of chance stood beside us and, with an indifferent nudge, pushed us right in, where we would be thrust into a world characterised by the same sense of randomness; many even get thrust in and don't last a few minutes. The passion, the smouldering hatred against chance that a special few feel as the void envelopes them is one that I find tremendous beauty in. Scraping at the void and reaming at the one who pushed us in as we plummet deeper is a hopeless struggle, but I find beauty in acknowledging that and in spite of it, persisting because your soul says you must. Now, I don't find pure beauty in this alone, without any additional developments; it is foolish to waste one's life away scrapping at something that could never be. But I find incredible beauty in the immensity of the attempt; and even more so in the transition from such a powerful sense of obstinacy, into a solemn, accepting glide. Drifting with the same ardour as one tried to project into a climb. And in this, I find happiness.\n\nMan\u2026 there you go\u2026 that\u2019s the kind of mood writing puts me in\u2026 a realm of pure intensity, where it ironically feels as if everything is the same: pointless.\n\nI\u2019m also very damn judgey\u2026 like VERY. I despise overly-positive people; I despise the collective where everyone huddled together and does hand symbols and talks about why life is so beautiful and perfect\u2026 that shit annoys me. \n\nI also struggle with my own expression sometimes though, ironically, since you wouldn\u2019t expect that from someone who just said all that\u2026 but I really do, I dunno if it\u2019s a self-image thing or what? But I find it hard to \u201cjust do\u201d things? Like mentally, when I reflect on my expression I\u2019m like \u201cwhy?\u201d I don\u2019t see why I feel the need to say what I say and to write what I write. I\u2019ve always had the outlook that as people, we just kind of go on and on and on and on\u2026 like, there\u2019s this piece of clay and artists and the like come along and mould it into this and that and this and that and I suppose they have the right to do so, just as much as you and me but I don\u2019t see what effect it has? It\u2019s virtually the same thing every time\u2026 every love story, every song, every book\u2026 there\u2019s never anything truly unique that says something someone else hasn\u2019t said before; everyone reaches the same conclusion that life is about accepting and being happy; we all go down this same journey of expression, rebellion and into acceptance and it\u2019s pointless\u2026 it is.\n\nIt\u2019s the same lives that we\u2019re living just over and over and over and over\u2026 each of us just experiencing it for ourselves: childhood, school, first love, friends, heartbreak, parenthood etc.\n\nIt\u2019s just the same thing but each individual experiences it for \u201cthe first time\u201d - I guess this depends on your religious beliefs - and none of it is truly diverse or special but, I find such sadness yet beauty in the insignificance of everyone\u2019s experience in the grand scheme of things yet the significance that it all holds to the individual\u2026 I don\u2019t know how I feel about it or what to make of it if I\u2019m honest :/ I guess I\u2019m still figuring all that out.\n\nSee I\u2019ve always considered that emotions don\u2019t interest me\u2026 I\u2019ve always believed I really don\u2019t see too much depth in them because, I\u2019m honestly pretty sure they\u2019re archetypal as hell\u2026 but this shit? This interests me\u2026 and I suppose it is emotions? But to me it\u2019s more implications\u2026 but I guess that being said I\u2019m focusing more on my own reaction to it than anything\u2026 which makes me feel pretty damn selfish tbh haha\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 but after constantly seeing others doing the same thing, expressing the same shit over and over and then wanting to do it myself? I cant help but feel like a bit of a hypocrite. Even then, even if I wasn\u2019t critiquing it, it stills makes me feel selfish for believing I should express something that has already been expressed countless times\u2026.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": "INFJ", "logprobs": {"INF": [{"token": "INF", "logprob": -0.5665277}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -1.7758535}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -1.9662641}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -2.1479945}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.8086104}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -7.1062407}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.2793975}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.5421004}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -8.122127}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -8.861514}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.874581}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -8.937518}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -9.710761}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -9.888541}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.211682}, {"token": "Intro", "logprob": -10.301694}, {"token": "Int", "logprob": -10.302398}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -10.310466}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.486493}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -10.64383}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -8.418666e-06}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -11.979655}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.350932}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -16.031466}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.279633}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -16.437395}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -17.345615}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -17.523241}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -17.840715}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -18.308743}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -18.344025}, {"token": "PS", "logprob": -18.60306}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -18.61983}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -18.635195}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -18.88919}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -18.903374}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -18.941246}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -18.960543}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -19.156162}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -19.335526}]}}

But i go to yoga because its  calming and you don't sweat, I hate sweating\n\n**\\* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\n i mean im not constantly curious, but i do have my moments. for example, if there are stairs at my school that i have never seen before, i would go up there to see where it would lead me. I like to know how other people perceive me since i dont really have my own sense of identity. I also like learning abt things that don't make sense, like the unknown, we don't rly know much abt the ocean which makes me curious, and i like things that are abt like ghosts and stuff like that, which u cant prove with science\n\n**\\* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?** \n\ni do like leadership positions because im good at managing things, or giving people tasks. When we're planning a trip with friends, im the one who makes all the plans, going there and this, choosing the hotel, transport, almost everything. \n\n**\\* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?** \n\nim not clumsy, i don't really get lost, (but its not always) since im pretty perceptive of my surroundings. i can find a store pretty quick, but sometimes i cant find it, when it's right in front of me. But when im inside a big store that sell the same item of different variants, my brain stops working. Since I'm majoring in architecture, i draw a lot and make models a lot, but honestly i don't really have an opinion about it since its something i have to do in order to get a grade. But to be completely honest, im pretty bad at making models compared to my friends, im pretty average at drawing too\n\n**\\* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI like listening to music a lot, but i cant think of myself creating music. I like meaningful songs i also like meaningless (but it doesn't mean like songs with weird beats and bad lyrics, its either good lyrics bad beat or good beat and bad lyrics) songs, i mostly enjoy witch craft and beautiful soundtracks from movies. My fav song atm is Jhene Aiko - Stay Ready, i really like the lyrics and her voice. I like songs that are new, I don't like kpop because they all seem repetitive, but also because they seem like they're doing it for relevance, money and not just for the sake of creating good music. I also like browsing Pinterest, and adding pictures that fit the vibe im looking for. I also like drawing, i imagine something so beautiful but the drawing i did\u2026. Well it\u2019s not what i expected it to look like, it looks so bad. My friends are really good at drawing architecture stuff, but im not on their level which makes me wonder if im just pursuing something that im not made for. There are kids that are worse than me but they are trying, unlike me. I think I'm not desperate enough\n\n**\\* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?** \n\nI don't really have an opinion about past, but sometimes i perceive people and analyze them, about present, i really try to enjoy it, but right now im dealing with issues about my future, so i tend to think a lot about the future. Im always making plans for the nearest future. When i don't plan my week it feels so wrong. I'm also making plans for months, right now I planned my life until September. When I have to do something I need a plan, I can't do spontaneous because it makes me feel uncomfortable. I need to know what I will do in advance and not just say it without thinking \n\n**\\* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?** \n\ni would help them, i like helping people, i like it when people are happy because of me. But when im not in my mood i wouldn't help them\n\n**\\* Do you need logical consistency in your life?** \n\nprobably yes. I dont know if it counts as logic, but one time we were looking for parking but the cars kept returning so i thought they are going back for a reason, but Mom was like nah lets at least try. And yes there was no parking and I was right. And there are double doors where i live because it is cold in the winter, and i didn't know which ones were closed, so i js looked at where it was wet and followed it. I'm someone who learns from other's mistakes, because I hate failing\n\n**\\* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?** \n\ni try to be productive but im just lazy and phone addicted. But when I pass the day where I did nothing i kind of feel guilty, because i just wasted a day doing nothing\n\n**\\* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?** \n\nI dont know if it counts but when im talking to someone who has upper hand, i tend to talk to them with like im a pitiful person, so they will feel the need to talk to me nicely and help me. (english isnt my first lan so this came out a little weird) my friends do say i tend to be bossy, which im not sure if i am. I try to be nice to everyone so they can be handy later\n\n**\\* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?** \n\ni like playing sims, making up stories, making them cheat on each other, i create a little story in my head and play it out. I like watching horror games for the sake of the lore, i like watching tv shows for the same reason. I like puzzles, or detective games\n\n**\\* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?** \n\nif i have to learn about some building materials i have to know what that thing does and how it feels like, and looks like, so when im imagining i can know what it is. im not good at straight-up memorizing, i can only memorize when i understand how that thing works or what's it about. When given assignment, I prefer assignments that give long deadline, and specific points on what I have to do and not just vague. I honestly do work better under pressure. \n\n**\\* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?** \n\nwhen im doing an assignment, i tend to plan how im gonna do that first, break it down into simpler terms and get to it. \n\n**\\* What's important to you and why?** \n\nEducation and health, no one can replace a skillful worker, living without worrying abt money. \n\n**\\* What are your aspirations?** \n\ni aspire to be someone like dick Grayson (corny i know), because he's emotionally mature and a good leader. \n\n**\\* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?** \n\nI fear of failing. I dislike people who judge others for no reason, let them live, if they're happy it doesn't matter. But this doesn't involve immoral, and weird stuff like identifying as an animal\n\n**\\* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?** \n\nreally sociable, making new friends easily, patient, not stressing, productive\n\n**\\* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?** \n\nwanting to kms i guess, not looking forward\n\n**\\* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?** \n\nim not sure, i would say i do think about stuff a lot, but sometimes im not aware when someone is talking to me. I like to walk because when im walking i think a lot\n\n**\\* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?** \n\nidk\n\n**\\* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?** \n\ni realize stuff like, collecting small details, subconsciously, and combining it into one decision. When im making an important decision I try to look how it would affect me in the future and pros and cons\n\n**\\* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?** \n\ni think emotions are important, i think experiencing all emotions makes us human, anyone can get angry, or happy, and i try to understand where they're coming from and why they're doing that\n\n**\\* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often?** \n\nI try not to ,but i think i do that so i wont be judged, and kind of validated i guess, but if its something that's clearly weird then i will judge them\n\n**\\* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nhonestly, compared to my friends im more of a rule follower unless its a dumb rule that makes no sense\n\n**\\* What is the ideal life, in your opinion? you see, im worried a lot about my future, so a life with no worries yet not so boring would be perfect**\n\nFeel free to ask me questions.

{"submission": "(I go on a huge rant here; I don\u2019t really follow any structure or specific questions so if it\u2019s not specific enough to what mbti measures, just let me know and I\u2019ll delete it and answer some questions, thank youuuu)\n\nI\u2019m 16, male, I think I\u2019m an INXP? Although I\u2019m open to anything if I\u2019m honest.\n\nUmmmm, I like to write? Sometimes? I need to be in a pretty specific state though, and it\u2019s not a lovely one. Although I do live for it in a way? It\u2019s very intense\u2026 it\u2019s one where I wonder whether my love or anything I do matters and I always come to the conclusion that no, of course it doesn\u2019t. And I hate it, I want to rebel against it\u2026 like a man growing angry at their old age: their bones are more frail, muscles are not what they used to be and now they struggle to do what they used to enjoy\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the inevitable\u2026 it encapsulates me in so much beauty. Trying to swim against a tide\u2026 trying to claw your way out of the void\u2026\n\nThe agonising yet alluring idea that we were thrust into this world against our own will: we gazed into a well, not full of water, but full of abyss. And the figure of chance stood beside us and, with an indifferent nudge, pushed us right in, where we would be thrust into a world characterised by the same sense of randomness; many even get thrust in and don't last a few minutes. The passion, the smouldering hatred against chance that a special few feel as the void envelopes them is one that I find tremendous beauty in. Scraping at the void and reaming at the one who pushed us in as we plummet deeper is a hopeless struggle, but I find beauty in acknowledging that and in spite of it, persisting because your soul says you must. Now, I don't find pure beauty in this alone, without any additional developments; it is foolish to waste one's life away scrapping at something that could never be. But I find incredible beauty in the immensity of the attempt; and even more so in the transition from such a powerful sense of obstinacy, into a solemn, accepting glide. Drifting with the same ardour as one tried to project into a climb. And in this, I find happiness.\n\nMan\u2026 there you go\u2026 that\u2019s the kind of mood writing puts me in\u2026 a realm of pure intensity, where it ironically feels as if everything is the same: pointless.\n\nI\u2019m also very damn judgey\u2026 like VERY. I despise overly-positive people; I despise the collective where everyone huddled together and does hand symbols and talks about why life is so beautiful and perfect\u2026 that shit annoys me. \n\nI also struggle with my own expression sometimes though, ironically, since you wouldn\u2019t expect that from someone who just said all that\u2026 but I really do, I dunno if it\u2019s a self-image thing or what? But I find it hard to \u201cjust do\u201d things? Like mentally, when I reflect on my expression I\u2019m like \u201cwhy?\u201d I don\u2019t see why I feel the need to say what I say and to write what I write. I\u2019ve always had the outlook that as people, we just kind of go on and on and on and on\u2026 like, there\u2019s this piece of clay and artists and the like come along and mould it into this and that and this and that and I suppose they have the right to do so, just as much as you and me but I don\u2019t see what effect it has? It\u2019s virtually the same thing every time\u2026 every love story, every song, every book\u2026 there\u2019s never anything truly unique that says something someone else hasn\u2019t said before; everyone reaches the same conclusion that life is about accepting and being happy; we all go down this same journey of expression, rebellion and into acceptance and it\u2019s pointless\u2026 it is.\n\nIt\u2019s the same lives that we\u2019re living just over and over and over and over\u2026 each of us just experiencing it for ourselves: childhood, school, first love, friends, heartbreak, parenthood etc.\n\nIt\u2019s just the same thing but each individual experiences it for \u201cthe first time\u201d - I guess this depends on your religious beliefs - and none of it is truly diverse or special but, I find such sadness yet beauty in the insignificance of everyone\u2019s experience in the grand scheme of things yet the significance that it all holds to the individual\u2026 I don\u2019t know how I feel about it or what to make of it if I\u2019m honest :/ I guess I\u2019m still figuring all that out.\n\nSee I\u2019ve always considered that emotions don\u2019t interest me\u2026 I\u2019ve always believed I really don\u2019t see too much depth in them because, I\u2019m honestly pretty sure they\u2019re archetypal as hell\u2026 but this shit? This interests me\u2026 and I suppose it is emotions? But to me it\u2019s more implications\u2026 but I guess that being said I\u2019m focusing more on my own reaction to it than anything\u2026 which makes me feel pretty damn selfish tbh haha\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 but after constantly seeing others doing the same thing, expressing the same shit over and over and then wanting to do it myself? I cant help but feel like a bit of a hypocrite.

{"submission": " \n\n17 Q\u2019s\n\n1. What\u2019s your biggest fear?\u00a0\n\nI think that my biggest fear is probably either not living up to my potential or not living my best life and regretting most of my life/life decisions\n\n1. What\u2019s your biggest desire?\n\nTo be happy/be my best self\n\n1. What are you \u2018\u2019the best\u2019\u2019 at?\n\nI\u2019m not \u201cthe best\u201d at anything in particular, I think that I\u2019m pretty good at a lot of things but I can always think of someone that does the things that I\u2019m good at that is better than me\n\n1. How do you see yourself right now?\n\nI see myself as a total mess that can either clean up my act, focus, and do the work to figure out my life and what I want out of life, or I can like fail and die I guess idk\n\n1. How do you see yourself 5 years from now?\n\nI see myself out of college, but debating if I want to go even further with my education or to start a career with the degree that I receive and focusing on my career in that sense. Maybe I\u2019m finally in a relationship/have been in a relationship and travel in my free time with them\n\n1. How do you express yourself?\n\nHumor and connections to fiction that I like (talking about it with others, relating myself or others to characters I like, relating things to themes of stories I like, etc)\n\n1. How do you feel about those near you (family, friends)?\n\nMy family is complicated, I used to like the ones that died, but now I have issues with them due to things I\u2019ve found out, I don\u2019t talk to some of them, and I have a good relationship with my mom (but I do blame her for some things), my relationship to my sibling is good (we have an age gap so its as good as it can be for our ages) and my dad is extremely complicated (our personalities don\u2019t clash and I have authority issues \\[from him\\]). My friends are good, I am selective with my friends so I mostly don\u2019t have issues with them and we have good relationships \n\n1. How do you feel about strangers?\n\nI try to keep to myself, but I often find them tedious and annoying, but if I have to deal with them I do it in a friendly manner\n\n1. How do you view change/uncertainty?\u00a0\n\nI think that change is good, if you\u2019re not changing you\u2019re dead. Uncertainty, however, is scary. While I don\u2019t mind change having a feel for what\u2019s going to happen makes me feel better than being absolutely uncertain\n\n1. How do you make decisions?\n\nI think that it depends on the issue, but I either run through all the angles that I can think of, come up with the pros and the cons of the situation, and make a decision. If I think it\u2019s more complex I will ask others what they think just to make sure I am thinking about the issue correctly and ultimately make a decision\n\n1. How do you solve logical problems?\n\nSort of the same on how I make decisions in general\n\n1. How do you deal with your emotions?\u00a0\n\nI think about what I\u2019m feeling, or if I\u2019m feeling spicy I just feel it, and I will talk to my closest of friends about it, but I also will distract myself with activities I do like reading, or climbing, or anything really to get out of feeling negative emotions\n\n1. What drives you in life? What do you look for?\u00a0\n\nMy own well being and happiness as well as being the best/well educated/healthiest version of myself that I can possibly be. I want to ultimately be happy and be able to be independent and completely stand on my own for reliance and my own enjoyment\n\n1. What do you hope to accomplish in your life?\n\nTo be the best me\n\n1. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you?\n\nI want to avoid falling into the traps many of my family members did and turning out like them and being miserable, angry, or toxic. I do not want to be one of those miserable old people that absolutely ruin the future for new generations. I want to be able to stand on my own, be independent, maintain my autonomy, expand my knowledge and experiences, and help people out when I can \n\n1. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself?\n\nI want others to see me as a good person who is intelligent and capable. And funny too. Like super funny. I see myself on the other hand as a mess just being propelled along by life\n\n1. Describe how you experience each of: a) Anger; b) Shame; c) Anxiety\n\nA) Intense anger I repress and get major headaches for, but I mostly just feel it and try to work it out through external hobbies or tasks\n\nB) I feel intense guilt/shame for different things I usually just sit with it and eventually get over\n\nC) I am perpetually anxious so I just live with it at this point and I can function with it unless it\u2019s absolutely terrible then I shut down for five minutes and then \u201cpuke and rally\u201d essentially \n\n26 Q\u2019s\u00a0\n\n1. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nIntense, I grew up in a very strict authoritarian type household where a lot of rules and expectations were placed upon me . It eased (a little) as I got older and after my sibling was born but it\u2019s still a little rough at times, especially since my father has an explosive temper and is very anal so a lot of stresses have been present in my Homelife for as long as I can remember\n\n1. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI work part time since I\u2019m a full-time college student. I hate it, it is tedious and annoying, and arguable beneath me, but it pays the bills and I don\u2019t have the time to find another right now\n\n1. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nAwesome. I love having the house to myself and being able to do whatever I want, and if I get lonely I can always go out or invite someone over, but I\u2019m typically content by myself \n\n1. What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like a mix of things both mental and physical and I cycle through a lot of hobbies. My most consistent ones are reading, watching movies, video games, photography, drawing, rock climbing, skateboarding, puzzles, and probably more that I\u2019m not thinking of right now\n\n1. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am very curious/inquisitive I ask a lot of questions constantly much to the chagrin of my friends and family. I definitely have a lot of ideas that I cannot execute due to practicality issues, but also the amount of ideas I generate and how the contradict other ideas. My ideas are more conceptual that environmental where I think about \n\n1. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo I hate leading people, not because I\u2019m necessarily bad at it, I usually do fine when I have to lead people, but people are such pains to deal with that I would rather do something myself or just go with the flow. My leadership style is more or less just communicating what needs to be done, getting it done as efficiently as possible, and making sure everyone\u2019s needs are met so they don\u2019t annoy me or others\n\n1. Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nKind of, I\u2019m decently coordinated but I had to really work on it because I was very clumsy and awkward and I still have my moments. Despite my shaky hands and dropping things I do like working with my hands when given the opportunity and that can encompass anything, whether it is just trying to fix something, drawing, climbing, or just something to stimulate my brain while doing something with my hands\n\n1. Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nKind of, I like to draw when I can and that\u2019s mostly just different faces and facial expressions, but I mostly take photos and that just encompasses anything that I think looks cool, or I doubt I will see again or will happen again\n\n1. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI have mixed feelings about the past, I am simultaneously scared of it and scared of repeating the same mistakes, and look back on it and miss the simpler more nostalgic times. Present I am just moseying along and being bounced around, and I am scared of messing up the future\n\n1. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf it\u2019s something not annoying to me I say I\u2019ll do it, but if it\u2019s something annoying I\u2019ll probably make a joke and do it anyways because I believe in helping people when I can and would probably feel guilty if I didn\u2019t help\n\n1. Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI guess?\n\n1. How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nPretty important, I like to do things as efficiently as I can, put as little in get as much as I can out kind of thing, but I kind of suck at the productivity thing\n\n1. Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t think that I am, I usually try to keep away/stay to my own devices, but I have been told that I\u2019m very convincing to others and have a bigger effect on them than I\u2019m aware of but I don\u2019t really know what that means and what they mean by that\n\n1. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI have a mix of hobbies, and I just like them because I find them stimulating to an extent and they provide a different mix to freshen up my life a little bit\n\n1. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is visual and tactile, I struggle when people tell me things at length because I space out a lot so if someone is droning on and on I will accidentally space out and get lost in my head. I do that a little bit with visual too but usually I get lost in the image so it still relates to what I\u2019m learning. I prefer classes that involve logic and creativity, memorization is boring, and physical senses are fine, but I find logical and creative tasks more interesting and fun \n\n1. How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI\u2019m pretty okay at it, not the best but better than average. I am good at mentally breaking down tasks and organizing how I want to do things, but (and this is why I think I suck at strategizing) I sometimes miss details or don\u2019t predict something right so then I have to improvise or wing it which I\u2019m good at. I live by the mental philosophy of plan where I can, improvise when I have to \\\\\n\n1. What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI\u2019m still figuring this part out. I just want to be happy and live a fulfilling life at this point\n\n1. What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy fears are probably being used, dying unhappy/unhappy fulfilled, and not living up to my potential. However thinking about my future and taking the steps to improve my life makes me uncomfortable and I don\u2019t really understand why yet. I hate people that are locked in their ways and aren\u2019t open to new ways of thinking, especially if they are locked into ways that are harmful to others\n\n1. What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have gotten a few school awards, and I got into a scholarship program at the school I\u2019m at right now. I got a few awards in wrestling when I did that too\n\n1. What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nGetting stuck in ruts and fighting my parents and just being alone and stumbling along in life, not really getting a break, but not moving forward in a meaningful way\n\n1. How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nMostly detached, I daydream very often, but I have gotten better at becoming more present and aware of reality as I\u2019ve gotten older, but that is something that I had to work on. When I daydream at home I am somewhat aware of my surroundings since I pace a lot, but I\u2019m not super aware I\u2019m just not bumping into things if that makes sense\n\n1. Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nFiction that I like, fake scenarios that are totally fictitious , scenarios that could happen, the meaning of life, or anything that comes to mind\n\n1. How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI try to gather as much information and as many perspectives as I can to ensure that I make the right decision and then I go into pros and cons. While trying to make a decision and weighing all of the factors I\u2019m pretty flexible to the influence of others, but when I make up my mind that\u2019s typically the end of discussion\n\n1. How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nA while, I\u2019ve always had a hard time feeling my emotions, or understanding why I\u2019m feeling the way that I feel, but emotions are important to me so I\u2019ve been trying to work on that\n\n1. Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYeah, not super often but I will to keep conversation going and it usually depends on the situation I\u2019m in, if I think I can have an enjoyable time being honest I\u2019ll be honest, but if I think the person or people will be annoying and I don\u2019t feel like dealing with them I\u2019ll just appease them to keep things going smoothly or just remove myself entirely. But I usually don\u2019t try to appease others\n\n1. Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nPretty often, but not huge rules, if I think something is stupid or pointless I will not go along with it. I do think that authority should be challenged because I have authority issues and also just value my personal everything\u2019s more than people trying to be in charge of me. I understand authority and do follow it (if I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid) but I question it often. This will often lead to the authority figures explaining themselves and I typically agree with what they\u2019re getting at and go along with them\n\n21 Q\u2019s\n\nPersonal concepts\n\n1. What is beauty? What is love?\u00a0\n\nBoth are relative, beauty is what anyone thinks is appealing, and love is how and individual feels intense care and affection towards things and people in their lives\n\n1. What are your most important values?\u00a0\n\nDoing what is right, being right, being a good person, and living the best life I can\n\n1. Do you have any sort of spiritual/religious beliefs, and why do you hold (or don't) those beliefs in the first place?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI\u2019m agnostic, I don\u2019t think any religion is right, but god things aren\u2019t testable so I can\u2019t prove there is or isn\u2019t one so any god can be the one whether we invented them or not, but it doesn\u2019t affect how I live my life so I don\u2019t particularly care\n\n1. Opinion on war and militaries? What is power to you?\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t like both, war is stupid and unfortunately profitable which is annoying, and in American at least, we put way too much stock in the military and we should divert those resources to other things. Power is influence or literal strength \n\nInterests\n\n1. What have you had long conversations about? What are your interests? Why?\u00a0\n\nEveryone, I like to discuss anything I can with those close to me. My interests are in fiction I like, science, climbing, philosophy, and general life stuff\n\n1. Interested in health/medicine as a conversation topic? Are you focused on your body?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYes, my mom is a nurse, close family friends are doctors, and I like science so I talk about it a lot with them and I enjoy talking about it. I am focused on my body because I like being healthy, or at least the idea of it\n\n1. What do you think of daily chores?\n\nBoring, but sometimes there is a weird comfort in doing some of them. But usually tedious\n\n1. Books or films you liked? Recently read/watched or otherwise.\u00a0\n\nI like a lot of books and movies and I\u2019ve seen/read a lot of them but the one\u2019s I like the most or have read/watched the most recently are the spider-man films, invincible the comic book series, fullmetal alchemist, jjk\n\n1. What has made you cry? What has made you smile? Why?\u00a0\n\nI usually can\u2019t cry, and I smile a lot but not usually because I\u2019m necessarily happy\n\n1. Where do you feel: at one with the environment/a sense of belonging?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t\n\nEvaluation & Behavior\n\n1. What have people seen as your weaknesses? What do you dislike about yourself?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nProcrastination. I dislike my lack of discipline and ability to sometimes do what needs to be done. I also just feel like I\u2019m lacking in all of my traits and can improve all around, which is good in the sense that I feel I can always improve and work on myself and gives me something to do, but bad when I\u2019m not feeling super hot\n\n1. What have people seen as your strengths? What do you like about yourself?                        \n Honestly I don\u2019t know what others see as my strengths, I feel like I\u2019m not typically talked to about my strengths and what I\u2019m good and, and if they do it\u2019s when I\u2019m not around. I think my strengths are my intelligence, creativity, wit, charm and I like all of those things about me\n2. In what areas of your life would you like help?\u00a0\n\nEmotionally, and with my future\n\n1. Ever feel stuck in a rut? If yes, describe the causes and your reaction to it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYeah, I\u2019m in one right now. Usually school or work or monotony cause them or a fight with my family and I usually just become detached and float around, being propelled through life kind of just feeling like an observer other than a participant\n\nPeople & Interactions\n\n1. What qualities do you most like and dislike in other people? What types do you get along with?\u00a0\n\nI like humor, blunt honesty, intelligence, and creativity in others, and I dislike people that are stuck in their ways, out of touch, delusional, and stupid. I can get along with anyone if I tried hard enough, it just depends on if I want to or not\n\n1. How do you feel about romance/sex? What qualities do you want in a partner?\n\nI strive for romance, I would love to be in a relationship with someone I really like, but I will prioritize myself and my life, and given where I\u2019m at right now it would be very hard to start a relationship that will last so there\u2019s no point really so I doubt that will happen anytime soon. As for sex I don\u2019t care about, but I\u2019ve also had some traumatize experiences in that department so that might be part of it. As for qualities in a partner I just want someone that I view as an equal, that has a sense of humor and is totally open and honest with me\n\n1. If you were to raise a child, what would be your main concerns, what measures would you take, and why?\n\nMy main concern would be if I was being a good enough parent and raising them in the best most optimal way for them and if I was providing a good enough environment for them to grow up in. I think there\u2019s a lot of experimentation and feeling it out since all kids are different, but I would study some parent books to raise them as best I can at first and then when they develop personalities and stuff I would have to go with the flow\n\n1. A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward and outward reaction?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI would question them and ask to explain and talk to them about it. And probably judge them\n\n1. Describe your relationship to society. How do you see people as a whole?\u00a0\n\nI would love to not live in a society and be totally on my own. I think people as a whole are annoying, but I have to deal with them so I try to make it enjoyable when I can. \n\n1. How do you choose your friends and how do you behave around them?\n\nI do it based on if I vibe with them and we bounce of each other well and if our beliefs generally line up\n\n1. How do you behave around strangers?\u00a0\n\nI avoid them when I can, but if I have to interact with them I am friendly and try to make the conversation as fun, interesting, and enjoyable as I can", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -1.5149997}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -1.6689895}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -2.0207086}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -2.0836053}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -2.1330552}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -2.8725286}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -2.95262}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.140473}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -3.6243005}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -4.521075}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -4.9419465}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -5.5959306}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -6.1207814}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -6.1452928}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -6.1518598}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -6.791224}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -6.8028073}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -6.8388314}, {"token": "After", "logprob": -6.8481374}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -6.914664}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0029743758}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -6.1253557}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -8.156056}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -8.370595}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -9.482516}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -9.603263}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -11.066272}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -11.452085}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -11.570878}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -11.711305}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -11.727929}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -11.830577}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.280372}, {"token": "COMPLETE", "logprob": -12.334226}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -12.346494}, {"token": "__", "logprob": -12.694985}, {"token": " CON", "logprob": -12.7748}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -12.811513}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -12.985984}, {"token": "CP", "logprob": -13.069031}]}}
{"submission": "I first wanna say that I think I'm either INFP or ENFP and nothing else but I'm very indecisive.

Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI'm 25 years old. I'm not too sure of my gender honestly (my sex is biologically male though). You guys will see that this is a general pattern in the way I think: I'm never too sure of pretty much anything. I tend to express myself in ways that most people characterize as feminine. I used to think I was trans (and I still wonder...) but I also enjoy stereo typically male things like mixed martial arts. \n\nI dont know if by \"general descriptions\" I'm supposed to think in terms of physical or psychological traits so I'll do both. I'm indecisive, I interact with people I dont know in a way that is reminiscent of a skittish cat of the type that runs away and hides under the table whenever visits come. I like the arts, all of them. I love art. I tend to lack confidence. Physically I'm not tall, I'm 5'8 or 1.73 for the non-americans (such as myself). I have brown somewhat curly hair. I'm thin and slightly muscular but I also do have a bit of fat. I'm shortsighted so I use glasses.\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nAutism, generalized anxiety disorder-\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nOoo MAMA! What a question. I remember being raised by my uncles and grandparents for a chunk of my childhood. They were subtly toxic but I was happy, somewhat. My mom took over my upbringing when I was a teenager and she's very religious and terrified of satan. She thinks nearly everything is satanic and has subliminal messages, and I shared her fears for some time. She's a woman that loves to point at other people's flaws and who has extreme emotional outbursts that she never apologies for or even acknowledges. My dad is passive. My experience growing as a teenager consisted of hiding in my room whenever they fought. Also whenever my mom got mad at me and treated me horribly my dad just sat quietly and let it happen. If I talked back he teamed up with her and then they both mistreated me.\n\nAlso my mom was in weird cults in my early childhood and at some point I remember going to a place far in the countryside and we had to wear these white biblical looking garments and we also had to venerate the mother earth, or something. I ate cat food that one time, out of my own volition. I remember liking it but I wouldn't do that again. Haha.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI do nothing. My dream is to draw for a living so I can live as a recluse, but I struggle with disciplining myself properly, which stunts my artistic development (basically I'm not skilled enough to get comms). I really wish I had better self regulation skills so I could practice all day everyday and get good in no time. I feel so ashamed of myself, of my uselessness. My high school friends all have their diplomas or jobs or something and I've got nothing. I tend to avoid them, even though I wanna talk to them. I'm terrified of being asked \"what have you been up to?\"\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI spent christmas and new year alone last year and LOVED IT. I felt profoundly free and happy I even started to dance around at some point.\n\n\u2022 \tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good  at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like to read and I like to know what other people think about everything so I tend to get sucked into comment sections of nearly every social media. I tend to engage with media just as a excuse to engage with the comments. I NEED to know what people think, I need my own thoughts to bounce off of everybody else's thoughts. I also like to draw and write. I write both stories and poetry. I draw original characters. I honestly tend to dislike the more technical aspect of the arts, I like the part where it consists of just emotional expression and exploration of ideas. I really dislike details.\n\nI also like to watch MMA. And I like to read books and watch movies.\n\n\u2022 \tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What  are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nMy ideas far surpass my skills and my commitment abilities which frustrates me constantly. My ideas are mostly just about situations. \"What would this character do if Y character did Z and then if X character said to another character something along the lines of 'what if (...)'\"\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNO. NO. NOOOOOOO. My leadership style would be \"uhhh... can someone else take over?\"\n\n\u2022 \tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you  enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI feel coordinated but most people will always tell that I'm not coordinated at all, but I'm feeling more coordinated as of lately because I do much more physical activity.\n\nI'm a super recluse so my physical activity is just dancing around my room or shadow boxing or doing calisthenics or using my single dumbbell or my single resistance band (I use it mostly for my hips, I wanna have a..GRRRRRRREAT ASSSSSSSSSSS)\n\n\u2022 \tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular  artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of  art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI kind of accidentally answered this already, but only kind of. I like to draw original characters, I like to write very very short stories like sub-flash fiction I mean. I like to write poetry and I do so in very direct ways such as\n\n\"Yummy yum\n\nI like ice cream\n\nYummu ice cream\n\nDAMN, so good\"\n\nI also like to engage in surrealistic automatism. I also keep a dream diary and like to get artistic inspiration from that.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI'm terrified of the future, resentful of many things of the past, and oddly kind of enjoying my present. I often think of Paulie Walnuts saying \"I'm alive, I'm survivin'\"\n\nI don't know how I exactly deal with anything, I'm extremely scatterbrained. I kind of just \"do things\". I often feel like if I managed to level up my organization abilities and executive function in general I'd do a lot of stuff.\n\n\u2022 \tHow do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI struggle to engage with my memories so this one question is making me a bit frustrated. Hmmm! It depends, when I'm busy I go \"wait a sec\", but more often than not I'll drop whatever I'm doing and go help, given that I know and trust the person asking me for help and that I like them also. Back when I lived with my parents I hated to help because they were so judgmental and awful in general.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI honestly don't know but I'm inclined to say yes.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery. My inability to be efficient and productive is very painful to me because I consider these things to be extremely important in life.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI dont think I do but I could be one of those people that are manipulative without realizing which is a great fear of mine.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nSpreading my opinions in the interwebz and creating and consuming art. I dont know why I like to do this, I just know it feels like my entire mind refuses to do anything else.\n\n\u2022 \tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you  struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?\n\nI hate memorization and In order to learn things I tend to just opt for direct engagement. So if I wanna learn how to draw, I draw. If I wanna learn an instrument I just play it. If I want to learn a language I just grind anki and duolingo and do lots of exposure until my brain just figures it out. I don't often think actively.\n\n\u2022\tHow good  are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable  tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you  go?\n\nI make plans and then I forget half of them (or simply dont feel like executing them to a T) and then I wing most of the activity.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI just wanna get enough money to live comfortably with ZERO need for other human beings at all.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nGetting a severe life changing (or ending) illness. Having to live with my parents again. I mean, those are my fears. I'm also afraid of humiliation which makes me afraid of people. I'm afraid of being misinterpreted. \n\nIt makes me uncomfortable when people think I have intentions that I do not have. I hate people who are dismissive and cruel.\n\nI don't often know why I feel the way I feel and I don't think about it at all, I just take my feelings and if I see nothing wrong with them then I just keep em rolling and try to do something about them.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nNot living with my parents.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nLiving with my parents, it felt like being kidnapped for years.\n\n\u2022 \tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of  your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream often and I'm sometimes completely unaware of my surroundings. There's been sometimes I've hit myself with furniture or something. It's a very common occurrence for me to be asked \"how'd you get that cut/bruise?\" and then I answer (completely earnestly): \"I dont know\"\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI imagined myself dancing around, then yelling to see if there's echo and then sitting and saying \"I'll just meditate forever and find enlightenment, there's really nothing else to do is there\" but then I get bored and frustrated and start walking back and forth trying to convince myself that there's something else. Then I start acting indecent for reasons I don't really understand.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI can take very long or impulsive make a random choice. I very often change my mind.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI have no idea how my emotion-processing process works but I really value my emotions.\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nOh yeah, but not completely. I often half-agree with people or give non-answers that don't really mean anything but sound like I made an statement. What can I say? I hate conflict, I don't like it when people get angry at me. Sometimes I'll tell the truth as peacefully as I can if I feel its important and the only possible right choice.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI only break rules accidentally, I usually try to follow them because I don't like to get in trouble. It's easy to say \"rules are meant to be broken\", but then you get punished.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": "INFP", "logprobs": {"IN": [{"token": "IN", "logprob": -0.044317663}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.2505517}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.681866}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -6.874436}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -7.470984}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -7.9458814}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.024389}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -8.041082}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.784792}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.434462}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.479803}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -10.396551}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -10.398788}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -10.488226}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -10.510855}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -10.576805}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -10.779478}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -10.943045}, {"token": "Either", "logprob": -10.991644}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -11.155188}], "FP": [{"token": "FP", "logprob": -0.0004776208}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -7.931731}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -9.576354}, {"token": "FX", "logprob": -11.387807}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -11.707217}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -12.05687}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -12.644486}, {"token": "xF", "logprob": -12.785317}, {"token": " FP", "logprob": -12.856008}, {"token": "xx", "logprob": -12.95605}, {"token": "XX", "logprob": -12.987023}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -13.014806}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -13.794845}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -14.286878}, {"token": "fp", "logprob": -14.654791}, {"token": "CP", "logprob": -14.711937}, {"token": "FPS", "logprob": -15.033907}, {"token": "xp", "logprob": -15.091192}, {"token": "AP", "logprob": -15.5004635}, {"token": " x", "logprob": -15.57575}]}}
{"submission": "Hi there! I'm currently writing a character and I'm not sure what his MBTI type is. I'm gravitating towards INFP and ISTJ (his Fi and Si seem quite prominent) but I'm honestly not sure. Especially since some of his traits could be (indirectly) caused by his trauma. I hope my description will help. \n\nThe character is a guy in his 20s who survived a fire as a teen. His whole family died, except for him and his little sister (who he saved from death). Unfortunately, as a result of the fire he ended up with bad facial scarring, a few amputated fingers and PTSD. He's a difficult but at the same time very caring person that would risk his life for his friends and family. \nThe character's been raised by parents that cared a lot about living an eco-friendly lifestyle. During his adult life, he becomes a climate and animal rights activist. His morals are quite extreme (think: verbally attacking someone for using non-vegan shower gel, but even protesting at a friend's modelling show). He doesn't shy away from starting huge arguments, even with loved ones, which sometimes make him come off as very unfriendly. He doesn't see anything wrong with his behaviour though, because he believes he's making the world a better place. \nThe character is bad with change. He values routines in his everyday life and freaks out over small things like having the furniture rearranged. He likes things to stay the way they are and expects this from his loved ones too. For example, in the story he throws a scene when his friend cuts her hair without 'informing' him about this a few days in prior so he can mentally prepare himself for the change. \nHe tends to play the victim at all times, even when he knows he's in the wrong, can be manipulative and sometimes guilt trips people by bringing up his PTSD.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": "INFJ", "logprobs": {"INF": [{"token": "INF", "logprob": -0.2343645}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -2.0813322}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -2.700038}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -4.9961195}, {"token": " INF", "logprob": -5.2625475}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -5.986953}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -6.8924932}, {"token": " IS", "logprob": -7.3633738}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -8.565965}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.844224}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.04452}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.215728}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.710845}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -10.106658}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -10.465478}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -10.534577}, {"token": "ENT", "logprob": -10.696719}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -11.19534}, {"token": " This", "logprob": -11.453378}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -11.712466}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -8.180258e-06}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -12.387996}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.334516}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -14.246362}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -14.759372}, {"token": "PT", "logprob": -15.092895}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -15.400596}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -15.584006}, {"token": "JT", "logprob": -16.42504}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -16.796408}, {"token": "JS", "logprob": -16.818726}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -17.541267}, {"token": "JP", "logprob": -17.560986}, {"token": "...", "logprob": -17.573662}, {"token": "*", "logprob": -17.59277}, {"token": "/", "logprob": -17.603193}, {"token": "**", "logprob": -17.676481}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -17.708508}, {"token": " -", "logprob": -17.805439}, {"token": "-", "logprob": -18.108845}]}}
{"submission": "(I go on a huge rant here; I don\u2019t really follow any structure or specific questions so if it\u2019s not specific enough to what mbti measures, just let me know and I\u2019ll delete it and answer some questions, thank youuuu)\n\nI\u2019m 16, male, I think I\u2019m an INXP? Although I\u2019m open to anything if I\u2019m honest.\n\nUmmmm, I like to write? Sometimes? I need to be in a pretty specific state though, and it\u2019s not a lovely one. Although I do live for it in a way? It\u2019s very intense\u2026 it\u2019s one where I wonder whether my love or anything I do matters and I always come to the conclusion that no, of course it doesn\u2019t. And I hate it, I want to rebel against it\u2026 like a man growing angry at their old age: their bones are more frail, muscles are not what they used to be and now they struggle to do what they used to enjoy\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the inevitable\u2026 it encapsulates me in so much beauty. Trying to swim against a tide\u2026 trying to claw your way out of the void\u2026\n\nThe agonising yet alluring idea that we were thrust into this world against our own will: we gazed into a well, not full of water, but full of abyss. And the figure of chance stood beside us and, with an indifferent nudge, pushed us right in, where we would be thrust into a world characterised by the same sense of randomness; many even get thrust in and don't last a few minutes. The passion, the smouldering hatred against chance that a special few feel as the void envelopes them is one that I find tremendous beauty in. Scraping at the void and reaming at the one who pushed us in as we plummet deeper is a hopeless struggle, but I find beauty in acknowledging that and in spite of it, persisting because your soul says you must. Now, I don't find pure beauty in this alone, without any additional developments; it is foolish to waste one's life away scrapping at something that could never be. But I find incredible beauty in the immensity of the attempt; and even more so in the transition from such a powerful sense of obstinacy, into a solemn, accepting glide. Drifting with the same ardour as one tried to project into a climb. And in this, I find happiness.\n\nMan\u2026 there you go\u2026 that\u2019s the kind of mood writing puts me in\u2026 a realm of pure intensity, where it ironically feels as if everything is the same: pointless.\n\nI\u2019m also very damn judgey\u2026 like VERY. I despise overly-positive people; I despise the collective where everyone huddled together and does hand symbols and talks about why life is so beautiful and perfect\u2026 that shit annoys me. \n\nI also struggle with my own expression sometimes though, ironically, since you wouldn\u2019t expect that from someone who just said all that\u2026 but I really do, I dunno if it\u2019s a self-image thing or what? But I find it hard to \u201cjust do\u201d things? Like mentally, when I reflect on my expression I\u2019m like \u201cwhy?\u201d I don\u2019t see why I feel the need to say what I say and to write what I write. I\u2019ve always had the outlook that as people, we just kind of go on and on and on and on\u2026 like, there\u2019s this piece of clay and artists and the like come along and mould it into this and that and this and that and I suppose they have the right to do so, just as much as you and me but I don\u2019t see what effect it has? It\u2019s virtually the same thing every time\u2026 every love story, every song, every book\u2026 there\u2019s never anything truly unique that says something someone else hasn\u2019t said before; everyone reaches the same conclusion that life is about accepting and being happy; we all go down this same journey of expression, rebellion and into acceptance and it\u2019s pointless\u2026 it is.\n\nIt\u2019s the same lives that we\u2019re living just over and over and over and over\u2026 each of us just experiencing it for ourselves: childhood, school, first love, friends, heartbreak, parenthood etc.\n\nIt\u2019s just the same thing but each individual experiences it for \u201cthe first time\u201d - I guess this depends on your religious beliefs - and none of it is truly diverse or special but, I find such sadness yet beauty in the insignificance of everyone\u2019s experience in the grand scheme of things yet the significance that it all holds to the individual\u2026 I don\u2019t know how I feel about it or what to make of it if I\u2019m honest :/ I guess I\u2019m still figuring all that out.\n\nSee I\u2019ve always considered that emotions don\u2019t interest me\u2026 I\u2019ve always believed I really don\u2019t see too much depth in them because, I\u2019m honestly pretty sure they\u2019re archetypal as hell\u2026 but this shit? This interests me\u2026 and I suppose it is emotions? But to me it\u2019s more implications\u2026 but I guess that being said I\u2019m focusing more on my own reaction to it than anything\u2026 which makes me feel pretty damn selfish tbh haha\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 but after constantly seeing others doing the same thing, expressing the same shit over and over and then wanting to do it myself?

{"submission": "* How old are you? What\u2019s your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n18F. Suspected enneagram 8w7. Not sure what else to say here lmfao.\n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI grew up in a Christian family. In my family, they make it a known taboo to believe in any kind of theology but Christianity. It was kind of forced upon me for my entire life. I assimilated into it, to avoid being alienated from my family, but inside I have always been skeptical about religion. Any time I criticized the religion to my mother\u2019s face, I was treated like my perspective was invalid, told to shut up and continued getting Christianity shoveled down my throat. It makes me quite angry to think about it, and I resent any kind of \u201cecho-chamber\u201d belief system, to this day. Whether it be religion, politics, or what have you. At first I suppressed my inner critic, and followed the herd to avoid being invalidated, but in my teenage years I\u2019ve become much more outspoken about my perspectives and I enjoy debating and discussing topics with people. I feel like I can get a bit aggressive at times, though. I like to MAKE SURE people hear my point of view, for example I\u2019ve gotten so in depth about expressing my point that it leaves the person I\u2019m speaking to feeling bewildered and attacked, even though that wasn\u2019t my intention. I think this habit is fueled by the anger that\u2019s been embedded into me from all the time I spent with a metaphorical muzzle on my face as a child.\n\nMy family is also pretty emotionally distant, and that\u2019s rubbed off on me. They never really said \u201cI love you\u201d to me, or spent much time bonding with me, and I think it\u2019s made me into a very detached and isolated personality. I tend to suppress my emotions because I feel they are insignificant, and my friends have complained to me that I\u2019m emotionally distant. I once had a friend look me in the eyes, dead serious, tell me that I should get evaluated for \u201csociopathic tendencies.\u201d It cracked me up. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a sociopath haha, but it definitely got me thinking about how my behavior affects people. I try to be more friendly, and am getting more comfortable with expressing my emotions now.\n\n* What do you do as a job or career? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI work at a grocery store. I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on it. I\u2019m just doing what I gotta do to get money. I suppose it\u2019s nice to socialize a bit. I\u2019d rather be out getting crossfaded but whateverrrr\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude0b. Joking, not joking lmao. I\u2019m going to school for graphic design. And it would be a dream come true for me to make a living off my music one day, but I gotta focus on a more stable career for now.\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nSounds good to me. I usually prefer to be alone, anyway. (Not that I don\u2019t enjoy a good party lol). I\u2019d probably use that time to brush up on my guitar and music theory studies.\n\n* What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor activities?\n\nI have a lot of hobbies, because I like to keep myself busy. Mostly artistic kinds of stuff, like drawing, painting, macram\u00e9, and musical instruments. I\u2019m a great craftsman and I find pleasure in creating things. \n\nAs for sports, I\u2019m not huge on sports, but I am good at them. Right now I\u2019m only into weightlifting and yoga, but I played a lot of sports back in elementary and middle school, and I was always one of the best on my team. Made some good memories back then.\n\nOther outdoor activities, I like to go fishing, camping, hiking, biking whatever else you see people doing in North Face advertisements. I\u2019ll never turn down an opportunity to spend some time in nature.\n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would say that I\u2019m moderately curious. It really depends on if the topic at hand is something that interests me and/or is important or not. I will either be completely uninterested or be all in on something. And I don\u2019t think I have more ideas than I can execute. I take my ideas and projects one at a time, and am locked-in focused on it until completion. My ideas are conceptual, I am a creative and a visionary and I like to first consider the meaning and purpose behind the things I do/create.\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would be your leadership style?\n\nI\u2019m indifferent to taking leadership, but yes, I am good at it. I often tend to naturally gravitate toward leadership positions, because I\u2019m typically the most fit for that kind of role in a group setting. I would like to efficiently execute plans and ideas, and make sure everyone\u2019s needs and perspectives are accounted for, without sacrificing the quality of the group.\n\n* Are you coordinated?\n\nYes. Very much so. I think you can tell from my previous responses, that I am quite physical and coordinated. I\u2019m not really sure what else to say.\n\n* Are you artistic?\n\nYes, again, very much so. Art is my favorite thing in life. It\u2019s my biggest talent. However, I feel my art kind of differs from what most people think of when they hear \u201cart\u201d. I\u2019ve noticed most artists create from a place of extreme emotion or passion, and are highly in tune with their own feelings and interests. That\u2019s not exactly the case for me. I prefer to take a more methodical and practical approach to my art, and convey a message or practical purpose, rather than an emotion or idea. For example, in the past I have been big into anime and manga, and I wanted to illustrate my own manga, so I studied anatomy, color theory, perspective, and etc. I got very good at the more practical side of art, if that makes any sense.\n\n* What\u2019s your opinion about past, present and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nUm\u2026 I guess I don\u2019t really have an \u201copinion\u201d on that? The past, present, and future are just kind of, things that exist. I live with em, I guess?\n\n* How do you act when other\u2019s request your help? If you would decide to help them, why?\n\nFirst I would evaluate wether or not it\u2019s worth my time and/or effort to help them, then if I decide to help, I would help because it\u2019s quicker and easier to get things done with two people rather than one, and it\u2019s cool to be nice and help people out.\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes. If something doesn\u2019t make logical sense to me, I won\u2019t accept it.\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI\u2019m pretty laid-back, productivity isn\u2019t always my main concern, but I\u2019m not unproductive either.\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI mean, not really. I don\u2019t know why anyone would want to control someone, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want anyone controlling me.\n\nNow that I think about it, I can sometimes be quite persuasive / demanding, carefully picking out how I do or say things to someone to manipulate their reaction, in pursuit of something I want. If that makes any sense.\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? \n\nI am a kinesthetic learner. I learn by doing things. I seem to learn easiest when I can get a logical and brief explanation followed by a hands-on type activity.\n\nI struggle when there isn\u2019t anything I can physically observe and/or do, like sitting down and listening to a teacher talk for an hour. I won\u2019t retain any of that shit man.\n\n* Are you good at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks?\n\nI\u2019d say so. It seems to be the most productive to break tasks into a bunch of smaller tasks / increments, that way the sense of completion and accomplishment comes with each increment, and keeps me motivated.\n\n* What are your aspirations in life?\n\nThe only aspiration I have is to master guitar, get better at singing and make a manageable career off of it.\n\n* what do \u201chighs\u201d look like in your life?\n\nI\u2019m usually actively engaged in the group, cheerful, and just want to spread love and support when I\u2019m at my highest. But I am simultaneously rational and confident in my own beliefs and opinions.\n\n* what do \u201clows\u201d look like in your life?\n\nAt my lowest, my bottled up emotions usually all burst out into a fit of anger, followed by depression. I will have a short outburst then mope around lol.\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what\u2019s around you? \n\nI never daydream. I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t have the gene or something lol. I don\u2019t really understand how someone could dream while fully awake.\n\n* Imagine you are in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI probably think about what I\u2019m gonna do when I get out of the room. Then I\u2019ll think about how I\u2019m gonna get out of the room. Then I\u2019ll get out of the room. That sounds boring asf.\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you\u2019ve made it?\n\nI like to carefully consider every option and potential outcome before I make an important decision. And because I\u2019m so careful about approaching the decision, I usually don\u2019t end up changing my mind.\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nNot long, usually. I don\u2019t really feel significant emotions very often. I try to be the best emotional support I can be for my loved ones though.\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes. Because sometimes my unsolicited input isn\u2019t necessary or productive to the conversation or relationship. And like I mentioned earlier, sometimes I\u2019ll carefully pick out how I say or react to things to get what I want.\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged?\n\nAbsolutely. I break rules when I think it\u2019s okay to. And if the authority is never challenged, nothing will ever improve, and injustices and inconsistencies will remain.", "clean_guess": "ENTJ", "llm_guess": "ENTJ", "logprobs": {"ENT": [{"token": "ENT", "logprob": -0.16927177}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -2.4333498}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -3.3922217}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -4.261931}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -5.0227036}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -5.112185}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -6.39346}, {"token": " ENT", "logprob": -6.4984975}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -7.3314824}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -7.5703835}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -7.6296926}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.7496953}, {"token": "INF", "logprob": -7.7901177}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -8.016912}, {"token": "Ex", "logprob": -8.667894}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -8.685833}, {"token": " INT", "logprob": -8.746555}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -9.098499}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.20878}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.456224}], "J": [{"token": "J", "logprob": -0.47590223}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -0.9710995}, {"token": "RE", "logprob": -13.309971}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.471815}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.699995}, {"token": "Js", "logprob": -13.922541}, {"token": "j", "logprob": -14.059076}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -14.605225}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -14.874548}, {"token": "L", "logprob": -14.953308}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -15.247414}, {"token": "PJ", "logprob": -15.7487545}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -15.902225}, {"token": "M", "logprob": -16.05208}, {"token": "R", "logprob": -16.089909}, {"token": "-J", "logprob": -16.206013}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.226522}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -16.40363}, {"token": " J", "logprob": -16.571793}, {"token": "O", "logprob": -16.592358}]}}

{"submission": "I know I'm some XXTP type (istp, intp, estp, and entp), but none have stood out on what fits me best. \n\nAbout me: I'm 19, AFAB, and genderqueer. I have ADHD and \"high functioning\" autism. I'm a college student majoring in animal sciences. I consider myself a passionate person. I do not care much for what others think of me. I talk a lot, and I'm very opinionated.\n\nAs a child, I did very well academically, but teachers (and parents) always had issues with my behavior. I got in trouble for blurting and not following instructions. My interest was art. I had a tough time making friends and my peers called me annoying. In 8th grade I joined the debate team. It was a good fit for me because I love a good discussion and don't back down from conflict. I was never in sports in high school because I just do not enjoy them and I've got a bad leg.\n\nI always feel like I've been inbetween an introvert and an extrovert. Technically I lean toward introverted because being around people wears me out, but I've got a high tolerance. People say I'm an extrovert because I'm so talkative and I'm definitely not shy. If I spend too much time by myself I get sad and lonely, if I spend too much time around others I get overwhelmed and can cry or lash out.\n\nI'd say I'm a curious person. I'll often have questions pop into my head but I forget to look them up. For example I'll see a squirrel and think \"What do they do all the time? Where do they go when I don't see them?\" but other times it's like \"how many times have I put on a shirt in my whole life?\". It's usually little things and I'm not worried about always knowing the answer. Some things you'll just never know. I ask a lot of \"why\" questions.\n\nIf I were in an empty blank room, I'd first ask \"Why am I here?\". Then \"How long will I be here? What am I waiting for?\". I'd look around and notice if the carpet is old or something like that. \n\nMy opinion about the past, present, and future is that the present matters the most. You're always living in the present and it's dumb to get into \"what ifs\" that either didn't happen or are extremely unlikely to happen. I don't mind it when it's plausible things, but the further away from reality the less interested I am.\n\nI've taken some philosophy classes and I enjoy it. It's fun to think about tricky questions and new perspectives. I like the Ship of Thesus but I don't like \"do we live in the Matrix?\" type questions. I can see why some people want to question reality but it seems pointless to me. It doesn't matter if we live in a simulation because there's no way to definitively prove it and even if you did it wouldn't change anything. I think philosophy can go down a rabbit hole of questions that can't and don't need to be answered. Like I said earlier, somethings you'll never know and that's okay.\n\nI like to keep my hands busy. I doodle in class while I'm listening. I work in the food industry and I'd rather make parts of orders than stand at the register. I also worked as a server and mostly enjoyed it. Something about following the same steps is really nice. \n\nIf you've got any more questions for me I'm happy to answer them :)", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": "ENTP", "logprobs": {"ENT": [{"token": "ENT", "logprob": -0.5423984}, {"token": " EN", "logprob": -1.6090145}, {"token": "EN", "logprob": -2.116911}, {"token": "IST", "logprob": -3.773178}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -3.8146286}, {"token": " IN", "logprob": -3.9220543}, {"token": "IN", "logprob": -4.766329}, {"token": "EST", "logprob": -5.1018085}, {"token": "INT", "logprob": -5.6829243}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.904808}, {"token": " EST", "logprob": -6.413746}, {"token": " IST", "logprob": -6.515253}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -6.5288067}, {"token": "IX", "logprob": -6.8184395}, {"token": "ES", "logprob": -6.947357}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -7.1039085}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -7.2384624}, {"token": " Based", "logprob": -7.260746}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -7.6397705}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.6522484}], "P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.0001789881}, {"token": "J", "logprob": -8.643232}, {"token": "x", "logprob": -13.94367}, {"token": "X", "logprob": -13.950052}, {"token": "H", "logprob": -14.913282}, {"token": "F", "logprob": -16.551802}, {"token": "p", "logprob": -16.696983}, {"token": "Ps", "logprob": -16.756445}, {"token": "Px", "logprob": -17.151098}, {"token": " P", "logprob": -17.376923}, {"token": "FP", "logprob": -17.75442}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -18.030048}, {"token": "TP", "logprob": -18.181402}, {"token": "XP", "logprob": -18.32615}, {"token": "B", "logprob": -18.427122}, {"token": "R", "logprob": -18.558838}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -18.732306}, {"token": "D", "logprob": -19.24057}, {"token": "<|end|>", "logprob": -19.25343}, {"token": "W", "logprob": -19.320263}]}}

{"submission": "Sorry this is going to be a long post :)\n\nI've been struggling to type myself because I've found lots of holes where I don't quite fit into the system. I understand this is supposed to happen to some degree since it can't entirely map out all aspects of a person's personality.\n\nContext:\n\n* I've been struggling to type myself, largely because after COVID I forgot how to socialise and created a whole new personality for interacting with others and how they would perceive me (something like ENFP, but this is not how I approach situations internally).\n* After COVID, there were two personality transformations that I made. There first when I became, I'd like to say quieter, but I really don't know, because my mum praised my cousin for being a quiet achiever (yeah, I know). The second was when was after my teachers kept saying I was to quiet, so I became more outspoken (that's the ENFP part)\n* I've always made objective decisions in some situations but about a year ago, that changed and I made a lot more objective decisions\n* I've typed INTP in a lot of different tests and I also resonate a lot with the 16Personalities description ( I know the test is inaccurate), like this statement for example: \"Imaginative and curious, Logician personalities can find endless fascination in the workings of their own mind.\"\n* I'm fairly introverted in new situations, I don't approach new people and keep to myself\n   * Example if you want to read it: My friend (ENTP) made 2 new friends after at an exam while I just spent the whole time staying at my seat eating a sandwich and eavesdropping on the people in front of me\n* When I'm in a comfortable situation (being acquainted/knowing around 50% of the people around me), I can be really extroverted and attempt to spark some form of conversation with almost anyone within this group\n\nNow onto the Cognitive Functions stuff\n\n* I'm definitely an intuitive - my Se is fairly weak unless I'm actively paying attention. I'm alright with Si, as usually when I'm trying to understand stuff, after developing an understanding, I will make connections with previous information\n* My Fe is also kind of wack because sometimes I can easily notice social dynamics and people's emotions fairly easily and have picked this up in situations where some of my friends (ISFJ and ESFJ in this case) haven't noticed. Other times this can completely fly over my head, especially when my Ti is most active\n   * just to show you how bad, here's an example (you can skip if you want, it's not really that relevant): After a test, Friend A was saying comforting words (i thought to) to friend B, who was crying but then went to hug friend C, and I was like \"Why are you hugging friend C?\" And then friend C turned with tears streaming down her face. Not one of my proudest moments and I felt so bad afterwards\n* My Fi is alright, I'd like to say that i am fairly aware of my emotions when they come, but i despise talking about them, especially more personal emotions. I also can be sensitive sometimes\n* My Te is also fairly strong to: in group projects, I like to take the lead and prefer it over following others, especially if I think I can do it better. I also get annoyed in projects if not everyone is completing their parts, but I guess everyone does to so yeah\n* My Ne is also fairly strong: I like to come up with new and random ideas and just run with it. But I don't really like brainstorming tasks, (which could be at fault of the assignment since I usually already know what I want to do).\n* I don't really get Ni so I'm just going to throw random information in hopes that it might help you\n   * When I meet people that I'm interested in, I like to create little profiles of them in my head. These are usually more deep then just your favourite colour or something:\n      * this person is regarded as \"smart\" because of their good grades but their scared they won't make it because they just memorise the details and don't really develop an understanding of whatever they are learning and thus won't be able to apply it (When I came to this conclusion I hadn't studied with that person before)\n      * (BTW I'm not trying to be creepy, I'm just trying to understand them better)\n      * I don't really know if this qualifies as Se or Ni but I play basketball and sometimes my brain kind of just maps out a path to follow thats usually leads to a goal. Mind you, I'm really not that good so this is always really exciting for me. I also have no idea how to spark this\n\nWow! This ended up really long!
