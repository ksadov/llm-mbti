{"submission": "The most consistent thing I've heard about myself all life is that I'm stubborn and impulsive. I often act on my whims without thinking about consequences. I've done and said many things that I regret. I think about future to some degree but it's more like set of imagines of things I would like to try or see or accomplish than concentrate plans.\nI have hard time making choices. Once I focus on one thing there's other that pop up in my head and I constantly ping pong between different ideas. I moved from town to town most times that any person I know. New month - new crush. I changed my college major few times, to be honest still don't know what I want/should do. Being trapped in something that I don't feel like doing or not good at got me scared. I really want to achieve something, be expert at what I do and being unbeaten, irreplaceable. I can lie about things just to impress someone, appear cooler than I'm. My life is never enough, always feel like there is something missing, like now I have amazing  supportive loving bf yet I can't wait to love be something greater than than like things we see in movies/books, I'm never satisfied with what I have. Sometimes I think that whole my life I'll be chasing some amazing thing that will never become reality. One of the worst things you can do to me is not remembering me. It's make me angry, not matter how many years passed by since the last time we saw each other or for how long we knew each other. When I walk into room I want my presence to be noticeable and make impression. I don't actually care if you think how nice or evil I'm as long as I blow you over I'm fine with it. \nMy bf once told me if we ever break up it would be leaving, he's the emotional one in our relationship and I could leave if I met someone or have other exiting opportunity and just feel like it. And it was one of the most insightful things someone ever told about me. What if the thing with some else could be more amazing than what you have? \nI want to be one of these people who feels like sunshine, who people ask for advice or turn to with any kind of problem. When I walk into room I want my presence to be noticeable and make impression. \nI can easily and immediately express emotion. When I mad at someone or feel sad I can immediately talk about it and explain why and how I feel. In relationships with people I have need to know everything about them, what they are thinking, feeling, they dreams, I feel bad when I find out they didn't share their problems with me. When I think about my loved ones I think about as as team and hope to go through things together. I can easily spot when someone is feeling down or happy. While I can be blunt at times and say what I think in hard way I care about well being of these around me. But I'm not someone who put others before myself and think people split on better and worse ones. When I'm out with friends but don't drink they often joke if I'm sure because I act bubbly, fun and outgoing - meeting with people energize me and put in good mood. Of course certain people can drag me down but definitely not all. \nI can be most objective person and have ability to see every side of conflict. Life isn't black and white and get mad when people think I'm arguing when I just explain different perspectives. I want to know what's going on behind scenes and people motives. I get very excited about things and like learning/trying it out but mostly likely to touch subject superficialy. \nSometimes I feel like I live more in my dreams than in reality but I also like doing things. New places or cuisines from different countries. I get easily fascinated by things/ideas/people. I tend to steal personality or look of people/characters I'm amazed by. \nLong detailed things bore me, even if it's just recipes. I make a lot of list and plans but mostly fail to finish anything I started or even go from planning to actually doing it.\nI need logical consistency in life. I need things to make sense to me whether it's my friend decision or end of mystery novel. I ended up not liking a lot of books because of their endings, like this person couldn't be murder I won't accept that solving. I still can't get over fact that Bridget Jones in last film choose Marc Darcy over second guy. They clearly don't got along that well so why don't try with someone who  is also great and have a great chemistry? And if her and Mark are soulmates like movie try to convince us they'll eventually find their way to each other.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/167d6he)", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Looking for MBTI typing help, but I would also enjoy insight on other typology theories (esp socionics bc its slightly similar)\n\nI would also appreciate anyone willing to go more in depth and give me more questions / a typing session\n\n\n\nManifestations of my cognitive functions\n\nTe\n1. See the importance, but not necessarily good at it\n2. It feels like an expectation I hardly fulfil\n3. Enjoy planning but rarely commit to big plans\n4. Prioritise efficiency in simpler tasks\n5. Ie: My first instinct is to try thinking out of the box to find what I think the best way of doing something is (some might say is Ne)\n6. I can differentiate Te and Fi, but it can be tough choosing between them due to (2) and also because I value Fi\n\nFi\n7. I\u2019m constantly thinking about what I like, value, and my stand on certain topics\n8. This makes me quite stubborn, self centred and emotional (I tend to have outbursts of emotions)\n9. I used to express controversial opinions a lot when common beliefs did not make sense to me, but I have learnt from the backlash and now try to express them less, though my thoughts haven\u2019t changed\n10. My morals are usually guided by reasoning, where I need to be able to explain why certain rules should be followed (a trend I see is that most of them end up at \u201crights\u201d, which is hard for me to explain further)\n11. Smaller traits like needing to have a special identity and being into typology-ish things all my life might be related to Fi\n\nFe\n12. I enjoy a harmonious group (ie. social practices that everyone follows) (but not in a situation where this turns possibly oppressive), even though I don\u2019t really go with the flow and neglect my own needs \n13. I kind of value the socionics definition of it. I love strong emotional atmospheres. Like listening to melancholic songs and feeling the emotional expressions of the instrumentals and vocals. \n13.5. When it comes to actually expressing emotions, I can\u2019t find the right words, I use metaphors and pictures.\n14. I often act oblivious to social tension because I do not know how to deal with them, though I can be easily influenced\n15. However, I have observed that I am not well aware about the people around me, I live in my own world\n16. I\u2019m gradually learning about the importance of Fe matters (its more about maturing ig)\n\nTi\n17. I\u2019m very into analysing and creating systems, hierarchies and categories\n18. I feel the need to rephrase everything I learn in a way I can understand better\n19. A dislike for ambiguity makes me search for an explanation / reason behind everything (eg. delving into philosophy and quantum physics even though I do not intend on any actual practical use, or just asking questions in my mind frequently and reflecting on observations)\n20. I cannot live with a jumble of unfiltered information, and I need things to make sense (It\u2019s hard to explain but basically everything needs to link together nicely and I need to make sure I have everything) (Love mind maps)\n21. Although I place value on Ti, it is hard for me to be completely logical, impersonal and objective in my decision making\n\n\nSe\n22. Most manifestations of this are related to the socionics definition of Si (ie. I enjoy indulging in comfort, I often choose whatever is physically easier)\n23. But it\u2019s not that I prioritise immediate physical comfort over everything else (ie. I try to be eco-friendly despite any slight inconveniences it may cause)\n24. I like thinking about the optimal space and state I would like to be in \n25. I can get quite sensitive to some sensory experiences (eg. it\u2019s hard to sleep unless its completely dark and silent, having to wash my feet whenever I step into the kitchen)\n26. It is quite difficult for me to be \u201cin the moment\u201d, as I space out a lot, though this may be due to factors such as the rise in social media scrolling\n\n\nNi\n27. Ni is like the \u201ccome and go\u201d function for me, where it\u2019s really like the \u201caha moment\u201d that appears every now and then, but I do not get to hung up on them because I need the security of accuracy (19)\n28. I do place interest and value on Ni stereotypes like symbolisms and dreams (I have a diary just for dreams), but of course, this isn\u2019t a good way to type \n\nNe\n29. I can often \u201cspit out ideas like a machine gun\u201d, except for in situations under extreme stress or when I really don\u2019t know anything about the given topic\n30. Again, stereotypes, but I\u2019ve been commonly described as creative all my life\n31. I do frequently bounce on different ideas and it is hard for me to commit to one unless I\u2019ve spent enough time with it and got attached (I get attached easily)\n32. I blame Ne on my constant oversharing and annoying explosions of messages sent to my friends\n33. Despite all that, I doubt that I have fully mastered this function, I\u2019m not good at constantly churning out new ideas on the spot for an extended time and keeping conversations going\n\n\nSi\n34. Probably quite strong, I want the security of proven sustainable methods when I get really stressed out and uncertain\n35. Points in (22)\n36. I\u2019m often scolded for being careless, I don\u2019t notice small details, except for when I\u2019m casually staring at a building analysing its structure etc\n37. I guess I am a person of habits, I naturally fall into the same routines without noticing\n38. Sensory association is pretty common for me, I look at aesthetics, themes (and concepts) and they just become registered in my mind as a fuzzy ball ready to be connected to other stuff. Its basically like listening to a song and imagining a place / scenario (like: staring out of the window of a rocket in silence as I depart earth that is about to be destroyed!!)", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "1) Happiness is overrated. I don't understand people's need for constant pursuit of happiness. Happiness is a fleeting and unstable thing. I want peace. I don't strive to have Happiness in life, I want peace. Things will never be happy 24/7. I will feel sadness, anger, stress, and love. There is a beauty to every emotion. Sadness allows you to feel every little thing. Anger fuels passion. Love drives us forward. Happiness let's us stay in the present. Stress helps us avoid mistakes and mishaps. Peace is accepting that there is a beautiful balance in all emotions. To say you only want Happiness is minimizing the beauty and need for the other emotions. I want peace in life and the ability to take things as they come, process them, and move through them. I haven't achieved complete peace but its my goal in life, not Happiness. \n\n2) Our values are stronger when they come from logic rather than emotions. Emotions are unstable and often inconsistent. If your values were based on emotion, they would be prone to shifting from feeling to feeling, never maintaining a set of core values. Logical values (personal or subjective values) are much stronger because there is a reason for them, a system we can rely on to justify our feelings, a way to maintain fairness in our values. For example, I find it odd that peoples view on eating meat to be an emotional value. When it's emotional, it's unfair. Which animals you deem \"ok\" to eat is essentially based on how cute you find them. That's not fair. I find the logic value should look at the emotional intelligence of an animal to determine the Morality of eating it. Or even have consistency and either think all animals are ok or none are. It makes no sense to me when people don't stop and break down the various aspects and logic behind their beliefs and values. \n\n3) I really don't know who I am. I see so many versions of who I could be. So many paths laid out for me in life. I can't choose. Who I am and how I act can shift from moment to moment.

{"submission": "Hi! I'd like some outside perspective on my type. I'm so deep into MBTI I can't judge myself accurately anymore and I keep getting really different results ...\n\n \n\n*Personal concepts*\n\n* **What is beauty? What is love?**\u00a0\n\nThat's a very complicated question. Beauty can be aesthetic beauty, as it can also be found in beautiful emotions, such as when something moves you or you feel at ease and in tune with the moment. Love is beautiful as well, I'd define it as a deep fondness of the thing that's loved. \n\n* **What are your most important values?**\u00a0\n\nImprovement, open mindedness, equality, honesty, duty, depth, passion\n\n* **Do you have any sort of spiritual/religious beliefs, and why do you hold (or don't) those beliefs in the first place?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI'm naturally skeptical, but as a good skeptic, I doubt both my earthly and my spiritual side. I have now come to accept both. \n\nI've believed in God for a short time in my childhood, because my friend at the time was a firm believer and she explained religion to me as if it was factual and that's what led me to believe her. Nonetheless, I could never feel a natural faith in religion and, eventually, I found arguments that explained every gap religion sought to explain, and I no longer had any reason to have that faith anyway.\n\n I must say, though, that I am a spiritual person. I am into astrology, energies and things of that sort, although I wouldn't stand by their veracity. Nonetheless, I can still feel connected to mysticism, it feels right, and some things have happened in my life that have made me at least question my beliefs. \n\nI believe now that your spiritual life doesn't have to rely on facts, the point is to let go of pure rationality. As humans, we have a spiritual side which it's interesting to explore, and the mere fact of the universe's existence is crazy enough for me to be open minded to anything being true.\n\n* **Opinion on war and militaries? What is power to you?**\u00a0\n\nI hate this question. Obviously war is not a good thing. Power to me is just a totally arbitrary system that we have created as humans to distribute opportunities and resources. I'm ok with leadership, and I find it necessary in a lot of cases, but being a leader shouldn't make you more important than the rest of the group. I'm always appalled when I think of how leaders would have no power if we just stopped listening to them, they're just as human as you and I, but they're up there because people obey them, and people obey them because half of the time their lives are at risk and the other half of time they benefit from that person being powerful. \n\nEvaluation & Behaviour\n\n* **What have people seen as your weaknesses? What do you dislike about yourself?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPeople have described me as weird, controlling, selfish, overly sensitive, distant, tactless, rude...\n\nI can see where these criticisms come from, but I believe I just have a really hard time with social cues, which makes me be perceived unfairly. I do admit I tend to overstep my boundaries and meddle in people's issues trying to fix them. I think my biggest flaw is actually being perfectionistic. I know this can sometimes be useful, but it turns against me making me unsatisfied with life, it's hard to maintain a stable self steem since I judge myself a lot for my mistakes, and I'm also really hard on others.\n\n* **What have people seen as your strengths? What do you like about yourself?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPeople have described me as intelligent, unique, good at expressing myself, helpful, genuine, mature, good\n\nI like my depth, my mind is a very interesting place to live in, I also like that I am reliable, passionate and driven. I am energetic, interesting and fun, and also very honest and spontaneous.\n\n* **Ever feel stuck in a rut? If yes, describe the causes and your reaction to it.**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot really, if I feel stuck I just try to move forward, but I'm always planning some kind of change in my life so it doesn't happen often. When it has happened, it might be because I'm feeling down and it's hard to get out of bed and do stuff, or I might be wondering when things will get better. I usually get out of the rut by finding a solution or making a decision, or just waiting because I know it won't be long til I'm back on my feet.\n\n**People & Interactions**\n\n* What qualities do you most like and dislike in other people? What types do you get along with?\u00a0\n\nI dislike fake people, I find it very hard to relate to socially conforming people, and I like interesting and intelligent people. I have a wide array of friends, my friends are usually people I admire for their personality and values. I get along with XNTP, IXFP, INFJ, ESTP. Ti and Fi users mostly...\n\n* **If you were to raise a child, what would be your main concerns, what measures would you take, and why?**\n\nMy main concern would be to raise them properly and not give them any trauma lol. I'd inform myself as best as I can to give them the best life possible, as it would make me very happy and fulfilled to give someone a chance to live a happy and fulfilling life.\n\n* **A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward and outward reaction?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI'm usually a bit taken aback, I might judge them internally at first, and then I'd try to see where they're coming from and I'd give my opinion. I don't usually let it show when I don't agree, as I don't want them to feel judged, but I let it be known (does that make sense?).\n\n* **How do you choose your friends and how do you behave around them?**\n\nMy friends are people whom I'm comfortable and I can be myself with, and I connect with them on a deeper level. I'm usually really genuine and barely hold anything back, I'm also quite insecure and worry what they think of me. I'm affectionate and honest.\n\n* **How do you behave around strangers?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nDepends on the context. If I'm at a party, I can act sociable, fun and I'm not as shy. I try to make things interesting and get to know new people. If I'm meeting people that are not my equals (teachers, older people...), I'm really reserved and cautious, I inhibit myself a lot, and I can't bring myself to be fake-nice even if it's good for the situation. On the other hand, if it's my equals but it's not a party situation, I'm also reserved, I'm not shy but I don't seek out interaction either unless something about them has caught my eye or they approach me first. \n\nExtra: Thank you if you've read all this, hope it wasn't too long. If it's worth something, I have spent an embarrassing amount of time on this post because I keep rewriting and selecting different questions and, oh well, I don't know what that says about me but it might be relevant lol. \n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am a 13 year old girl. I'm pretty aware of things in my life if that helps, like for example I know whats right and wrong (not letting people take advantage of me, knowing the signs, etc? It makes sense to me but I can't really describe it) but I'm trying to figure out if its me being aware or just common sense since I can't find a good word for it.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNo\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don't have a job\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI don't know I can't really think of how I would feel I'd have to be in the situation to know exactly but I think I would just be relaxed, and kinda lonely? Maybe I would be refreshed if I were exhausted from the week/day before or I really wanted alone time.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI never really thought about it, I like sports maybe I only like the idea of them and I've never tried any sports. I would only play a sport if I felt comfortable playing it, I like to think that I'm just too lazy to do sports but really I'm just awkward atleast thats my description because when I think about sports Im worried I'll embarrass myself I wouldn't beat myself up about it though because I don't really care but I care yk? I would rather spend years practicing than go in with little practice. For some reason I feel that sports are embarrassing, not for other people but for me I cant really explain it well.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI don't think I'm really curious I don't spend my day thinking about what could be or how something can change. If I am thinking about something I would say its probably conceptual most of the time like if I see a picture about space or some video about it I'll be curious and start thinking, \"Well what if \\_\\_\\_?\" or \"Wow so many unknown things\"\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nCan't say, I would need to be in the situation to answer this\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to LOVE art, drawing was my favorite thing to do and I would spend hours every day and more during summer drawing, doing origami, or making pockets for my supplies in notebooks or just the pages with glue or tape, I would have just stacks on stacks of art and I think I had about 4 notebooks that I used to draw in. I really liked digital art too, my art wasnt and still isn't really good but I dont care much because It's something I enjoyed doing and I still get really happy and in the zone when I draw or do something creative like mess around with glue and craft.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI don't care much for either too much, maybe sometimes I'll compare/remember the past and future with what is in the present but I'm usually just in the present, I think that I am a more in the moment person because after events or hangouts etc I cant feel the way I felt in the moment so I really like to stay in the present more so I can feel it. I don't know exactly what you mean by how do you deal with them but I'll try to answer. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nDepends on what it is, If it's something I know how to do or I can do it then I would say yes. If I do decide to help them I don't really know why I would do it, I just do.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nNot really.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nImportant but not super important.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don't think I control others, but if I did it would probably be because of something personal? Or what I'm feeling, I don't know exactly how though.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI don't really have any hobbies now.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is visual I think (I took a test before answering this). Sorry I won't answer the other questions because I can't think\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'd say I am okay at strategizing. Sometimes I wing it and sometimes I improvise or sometimes I do both so I can't say much for this question.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nHonestly I don't really know. I just want to be rich to where I won't have to work or have a comfortable job, thats my goal.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy only fears are the dark and rollercoasters, rollercoasters just make me uncomfortable because its not really scary but you can just feel your stomach drop and the wind doesn't make it better, even if I close my eyes I know I am on it and I would think to myself about if it's just some internal issue but I'd rather not. The dark is just self explanatory (I think thats the right word) its the DARK, what's inside of it? I would rather be in a room with light where I can see EVERYTHING than be in a room where I can't see anything, I've thought about it and even if I were in the dark with headphones blasting and nothing to see to give me the illusion I am safe what if something were to grab me. And now I see this answer is getting way too long so I'll stop here.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI feel like I am just unable to daydream, I can have a good imagination but trying to visualize in my head about things (I think thats what daydreaming is? unless it can be me and my thoughts then I will say no I don't daydream often) and dreams doesn't work for me so I would say I am pretty attached to reality. I pay a lot of attention to whats around me, but not in a super spy threat detected way. I'm more observing, in my head, when I walk into a room i pay attention to whats in it. (people, whats on the walls?, how I feel, what I should do)\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nAnything, but I won't leave that as an answer because If someone gave me that answer I would be confused. If I were in that situation maybe I would think about how weird it is or something like, \"Wow is this what it's like to be literally lonely?\"\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI think I take pretty long, I'm trying to think of what I did in the past but I can't really think of what I did before. I don't usually change my mind when I make decisions unless I should or think its a better thing to do.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI think I process my emotions a little slow, I find that I'm kinda mood swingy like if I'm crying or feeling something I'll just be thinking about the situation that made me feel that way, I don't ask why but in my head if needed I comfort myself like, \"\\[my name\\] It's okay\"\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNo\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't break rules often or ever. I don't think authority should be challenged or that they know better, if they arent doing anything that harms then its whatever? I'm not a rule breaker, I'm too scared depending on what it is but if were at my lowest I feel I would be prone to just give up and say yolo. I'm like that kid who never played ding dong ditch with the rest of the group because I felt it was too scary not really scary but like \"what if\" scary (covering it up with \"I am just too lazy\" or \"I don't wanna\") and also I just felt I shouldn't.

{"submission": "(1) I view the world through a subjective, self-referential lens. I both consciously and unconsciously make judgements on right / wrong, good / bad based off of how I would like things to be. I have a hard time accepting the world for what it is, always wishing things would be better.\n\n(2) I have a soft heart and have fallen for sob stories. I believe what little I can to help those in need, I will do to the extent of my ability. I sympathize with others by seeing myself in others or if it\u2019s a cause that I can resonate with. I can get to the point where I feel sad when I realize I can\u2019t do enough to help others realize my ideals for them (especially when it happens to be their own), and I feel like I\u2019m constantly struggling against the way the world is, but on a deep level I still believe that kindness and goodness will ultimately be rewarded.\n\n(3) I am not confident in things requiring a high amount of attention to physical skills, reflexes, and meticulous attention to appearances. I am skeptical of, and tend to be wary of people that live physically / dangerously, or people that I feel put a lot of attention into the way they look or are overly concerned with coming off the \u201cright\u201d way.\n\n(4) It is difficult for me to truly admire or look up to anyone. I am aware that there\u2019s often a lot more than what they show the world, and that everyone ultimately walks their own path. There is only one me, no one else can be me.\n\n(5) I have a tendency to eat the same food, go to the same places, and listen to the same music over and over again. I tend to categorize knowledge, remember facts, and use what I feel are trusted sources so I can build up a reference catalogue of information. When I make a decision, I cast the net wide, gather as much info as I feel I need to, and pick what I feel is the best option. However, I tend to be a procrastinator and indecisive.\n\n(6) I am aware of and can understand feelings that don\u2019t come from the same basis as my own, but when I have to make a choice, it\u2019s hard for me to ignore my own feelings and go with what I feel is the most right to me. For example, a friend of mine had someone close to them die. I would give basic condolences, but if I felt that the person was not a good person in my view, I will also let the friend know how I really feel about him / her and feel it\u2019s my duty to let my friend have an accurate understanding of what really went on in their relationship.\n\n(7) It\u2019s difficult for me to travel somewhere and only see the \u201cup sides\u201d of the place, I tend to be naturally skeptical of say, certain travel YouTubers who are cheesy and extremely positive about everywhere they go, when I feel like I would have to get at least a decent understanding of the actual social and political issues so as to come to a more truthful understanding. This ties closely to an interest in history and sociology.\n\n(8) I don\u2019t have a keen understanding or grasp of aesthetics, a lot of things I approach from a very functional perspective. Don\u2019t count on me to decorate a beautiful home. I don\u2019t like being tied down by \u201cstuff\u201d, with the rare exception, because I value mobility and I feel like I can better engage my feelings, my thoughts, and have meaningful experiences when I don\u2019t have to focus a lot on the materialistic world. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m as in touch with hot / cold, physical sensations as some other people are.\n\n(9) When I feel anxious, I become more critical and combative, a bit more aggressive than usual. I find fault in everyone and everything, and I feel strongly driven by a desire to correct things and make them simpler, better, but I am also very lacking in organizational skills. I feel highly repressed and tied down by rules and expectations, because I feel like they assume guilt before innocence when they don\u2019t even know me on a personal level or my intentions. I guess you can say I have a problem with authority. The fastest way for me to lose respect for someone is when someone uses their position of power to step over me, instead of using their personal qualities to make them deserve my respect.\n\n(10) I am not entirely rejecting of tradition and convention, but I MUST interpret them and follow them in a way that suits ME and makes ME comfortable. External expectations and pressures, I don\u2019t thrive under them at all.\n\n(11) Through both life experiences and self-analysis, I believe that the right people will come to me. It\u2019s futile trying to fit in and gain the favor of a group that never intended to view me as an equal in the first place.\n\n(12) My way of informing is dumping it all, giving all the knowledge I feel the other person needs.\n\n(13) I am at my best when sharing ideas, rather than creating. I might not have much \u201ccreativity\u201d in the sensual / physical sense, I prefer to engage and hopefully influence with my feelings, my thoughts, my attitudes.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I hope this post will gather some informed folks.   \n\n\nHello there. This is my first time posting on Reddit after several months of cultivating information about MBTI from some of you. I don't really like to resort to asking people even though I know it would help to understand MBTI typing. Of course, I know this sub would have a lot of people as \"not so\" informed as me, but I also read a few of you who have a very great grasp of what MBTI is. That alone, I think, would be worth a shot, given how exhausted I am reading some points I clearly do not understand.\n\nI really don't know how to start, so I would answer the guide questions the sub provided. May you continue reading, thanks!  \n\n\n**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am female and just turned 22 last month. I am quite interested in everything, except sitting down and doing the same thing. I was really interested in programming. I even started teaching myself, BUT I got tired after some time. It was one of my dreams to learn to program, but my focus is just so bad sometimes. One day I had it, next week I didn't. I wanted to have a routine, but I am bad at making it. But if someone would help me, and mentor me, that would be excellent because I am very good at learning things. I am also excellent at following directions. Although I would question it sometimes, I am very good at producing results. Maybe, I really just need some determination.\n\n**Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**\n\nI never had any medical condition that would greatly impact my mental stability. Though, I think I have to mention that I am anemic. This condition actually influenced my concentration as I would get tired easily. But, because I am currently taking iron supplements, the symptoms are not as strong as they were before. I am healthy, though not as active as I was before. \n\n**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy mother is very religious. She would not let me play outside unless I was done praying with her. This is not the type that would get me beaten up if I refused, but I did get intense stares so I never really had the chance to refuse. Clearly, I am just afraid to do it. Yet, I did remember getting scolded after fighting over a chalk with a neighbor while she was praying. That's where I got some little discipline. I would never do that again. That neighbor was so eager to steal my chalk, so I shouted. Ugh. In case you are confused, I used to draw to our walls. So, I needed that chalk. I also used the chalk to calculate basic math, you know, kindergarten math. I was four or five I think. However, my mother was so loving, she gave me colored pens. Now, the walls had permanent inks.\n\nI think it is important to say that even though my mother is religious, she would not force me to do every religious thing, but she would teach me some things. Notedly, religion was not the forceful part, it was the tutoring. I remember in the second grade (late), one mistake in any subject on my exam would be equivalent to one tiny pinch that would make me bend my body. You know classic motherly disciplinary action from being stupid. Well, at least that's what my mom always says. I was intensely (at least for me) tutored by her from the day I got to hold a pencil. I remember answering simple geometry questions during my first grade. Of course, I was not anywhere near a genius, so I would get pinched again. My mother had so high expectations and was very eager to show people that I should be on top. I was never let to play if I was not yet done with her exams (and perfected them). With these actions, I always miss to play with my neighbors. Well, they were not the best people I know, but they were the only people in my town. So in conclusion, I never had any solid friends. And if I made one from my town, I always ended up destroying it because I was not the kind of person who would conform to their expectations. AND THEY HAD SILLY EXPECTATIONS. I mean, they>! tried kissing!< in front of me. They asked if I would like to join, OF COURSE NOT. I was maybe 8 at that time. It was a nightmare. At that time, I felt that I was never in my group and was constantly asking if I was right for my age. Neither of them thought the same way as me and I was comfortable being with adults because they were often quiet or discussing things that I was interested in or gentler to me.\n\nTo add, I was also very competitive. I think my mother's actions really influenced me. In every competition, even simply playing children's games, I really like to win. I think that also created some cracks with my childhood friends. Well, they were not really friendly too, so I just really decided that they were not worth my time. So, I never really tried hard to understand them, even though I tried to please them sometimes.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI just graduated with microbiology in my diploma. The whole course experience was actually just dreadful. I mean, I never liked it in the first place. I was contemplating to shift during my second year because it was boring for me. BUT, the friends I already had were very kind, and thinking I would leave them would not be a very excellent decision. Because I never liked any course except computer engineering which was not available at my university, shifting would just give me a new environment and would not fulfill the satisfaction I was looking for. So even though the course was not really for me, I somehow enjoyed laboratory activities, especially discovering some things I never thought I would see under a microscope. It's fascinating, but still, I was not happy. Graduating with flying colors would not eventually equal how much I liked the course, it would just mean that I was afraid of failing because I would be extended. I needed to get out the FASTEST way possible. I was not on a consistent dean's list and this was the ultimate decision maker of my grades because the time that I was out of the list, I would pursue getting on the list just to keep track. I remember two perfect exams I just made because I was angry about the low GWA (for me) I had last semester. I was so angry at that time because I let myself be filled with sadness I thought I just created myself. So I perfected the exams and got a 4.0 on that subject. And it's just because I was ANGRY at myself. Then it disappeared and I went back again to a stressed student who needed some help with her priorities.\n\n**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nThat would be refreshing for me, even though I think a week would be too long to stay at home. I would spend the week on vacation. I love my friends, but the topics they would share would most likely be their interests that would not really suit me. I am fine listening to them, but it's finer to have a vacation for myself. I really like experiencing things alone as I would learn some social things. I am very awkward, but I'm fine with a stranger. I would think that my friends would judge me so I mostly prefer to go or experience things alone. A stranger would not have existing information about you, so you're free to try and manipulate the set of impressions you can present to them. Well, just being nice would be enough. I just don't like overthinking things, even though I do it almost every time.\n\n**What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage?**\n\nI do prefer outdoor sports and some indoors. I play basketball and archery. I also like strategic games. I don't like sit-down games though they look interesting to me. I like watching chess, I just don't have the guts to learn it by the book. More like, I like watching people think. I always try to predict things and associate them with social and behavioral cues, crossing out things and adding new information. This was easier for me. This was how I learned basketball and some of the chess moves and techniques when I was younger without watching a video or reading a book. However, I forgot most of them now, mostly because I have no one to play with. \n\n**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI think I am moderately curious. Well, if I would compare my curiosity to my younger brother, I would fall low because who else would destroy a fully working machine just to see what's inside and use the important mechanical parts to build a boat?? Nah, not me. And yes, I would have many ideas and I would not execute them. And I do think many people had that too. Most of my ideas are conceptual and abstract, and I don't remember several of them now. May be if I come across related things or when I'm working on something. But I did remember one thing, mostly observed by my peers and I never had any experience as I would like to have. An example: \"When you have a crush on someone, you would likely appreciate the things that you wanted to have that you found in them. It's not just about liking them, it's about admiring the things you wish you had that is likely to be present in someone. That is why sometimes you mirror your crush's appearance and match them instead of actually talking to them.\" This statement usually describes a *preliminary admiration*, if that's even a term. Another is \"WE can be conditioned to something powerful. That is why I believe that a great environment creates geniuses in their field.\" This statement actually explains why the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer. And for the poor to get rich takes very few coincidences that would make them realize that they can. They are not getting a good environment and usually, people surrounding them would just do the same. That is why education can be an important factor for change (education in any form, even not going to school). \n\n**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI am not the kind of person that would volunteer as a leader. I would want some of the members to choose their own. If I would be chosen, I don't really bother. I became a leader a lot of times during my younger years and some currently, and I really like to set up a meeting where we would brainstorm on the suggestions we have and pick one of the most voted and another one for an extra in case the first choice would not work. And I also like to make them choose what part they want to work for. If they would not present themselves, I would plan some areas (equally) to which the whole project would contain and select people according to their talents (if I know some of them) or select at random if we're complete strangers to assign the parts. That would be time-bounded, including time for necessary corrections if there is. THESE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN OUTSIDE MY FRIENDS (CIRCLE). My friends are really procrastinators and it is always difficult for me to make them understand that I need a specific amount of time to polish the projects we have to work on and submitting their part during the day of the deadline would be my nightmare. I mean, I procrastinate too, but they are just GOD-TIER. My other friend doesn't actually care about passing late, so I often help her with some parts of the assignment. She was somehow depressed because of certain pressures in her life. We felt the same thing (as I did during college), but I just had more control over my decisions. She was breaking. So I often get stuck stretching my patience even though I am really about to burst. Well, that's a friend, so I have to respect her flaws and be there for her no matter what. But I would be lying if I said I would like to experience that again. \n\n**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nIn my normal self, yes. I like my hands. I love to write. I also do archery so I need to be fully aware of my arms. I am coordinated, I think. I also have good reflexes. I think my body's well. :) I also learn a lot with my body just by physically experiencing things and I usually do DIY because I don't really have enough money, just like I made my archery target board.\n\n**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI was not as artistic as my mother. I am not also as artistic as my friends but I do like art museums. I enjoy looking at them and predicting what they may mean. I really never met anyone in my life who has the same view of the world as me, at least in real life though. I am not also very talkative online so I would have many friends. My friends in real life are the only ones I talk to online, too. I have some online friends before but some are older than me and the conversation never really worked. They got really busy with their work irl and quit social media. So sad.\n\nI think I express my thoughts in writing. In high school, I often write poems. I also write letters to my friends just because I express myself truly and deeply through words.\n\n**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI remember the past, but I seldom dwell with them. Most of the time, they are traps that would impact your potential in the present. Well, of course, I still remember things, but I don't like it. I wonder more in the future. \"Where could I be in 10 years\" \"Am I going to be rich?\" Such childish nonsense, but I still do to escape in reality some of the time. I also believe that living in the present will determine the future. So, I do every time I'm in my normal self. Maybe this would be the cause why I survived college even though I don't like the degree itself.\n\n**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nYes, I would grant it. Sometimes I am busy, but I still give time to my friends if they need someone. Even though I always observe that I am not receiving the same thing back. I just wanted to be kind, for I know the world needs that. And they're my friends, I always want the best for them.\n\n**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nNeed, yes, but I'm not always using it. I am sometimes impulsive and I hate that part of me. But even though that exists, impulsiveness created some 'fun' in my life. I was a rule follower during my childhood and it's fun to take some risks sometimes. But I am mostly logical throughout my life and check my existing values every time I am getting a difficult moral situation. I also would like to mention my ability to check logical fallacies. I am good at detecting those things which would really help me judge people's behaviors that are not just making sense. This comes like a superpower in some situations, where I can correctly guess that someone's pretending or lying even if we just first met. The statements they are just saying would not make sense. I don't know, other people (friends, family) do not go into this detail when they first meet with somebody.\n\n**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nVery, especially during schoolwork or group work. The thing is, I noticed that many of my classmates actually do not respect the concept of time. And when there would be a group meeting, most of them would be talking about other things and not about the work that must be done. I mean, I usually procrastinate myself, but that's just because I have a good knowledge of my abilities and some of the work may be finished within hours before the deadline, especially essays that I could just sit for 2 hours maximum. The thing with group projects is that they would be huge and have plenty of activities that the group should divide among the members. And I have very little patience with those people who would actually choose to do other things than what is planned. My friends are often like that, and I don't like it. I am not a meticulous person, but I can be if needed. I am not the most productive of the group, but I can produce results. Some just can't, and really, I hate it. I don't know, it's just one of my pet peeves. I mean, it's okay to deliver imperfect work, just tell me what part are you having difficulty with or why you decided to delay things.  I always give consideration. Just, you know when someone's just throwing their part and then they just let you finish it. \n\n**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don't like to control others just because I know it is not ethical, at least on my set values. But I admit, I have the tendency to do so. There were many instances, several of them were from my younger years. Those were BAD, because I was a control freak and I never liked anyone that's opposing me. Now, there are still remnants of it, especially the patience I have for somebody, but I have undergone some character development. I learned to be humble and actually treat people as people. Coming from me, this is a very huge jump. I think I learned some of these things because of my friends, the same friends I mentioned earlier. Those people have HIGH EQs, at least compared to me. That is why I still remain friends with them because they accept me for who I am, even though I am sometimes a pain. Well, I have the same sentiments as them, too :).\n\n **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\n1. Writing - I write to keep my mental health stable. I also don't like to express all my true feelings to my friends, so I write. \n2. Basketball/Archery - This makes me think that I'm really worthy of an opponent, even though I am not the best at these events. I pursue them because they are entertaining and would usually serve as my escape route from studying pressures and some personal problems.\n3. Jigsaw puzzles (I just remembered)- The only hobby that keeps me sitting (with some stretches) for 5-7 hours straight. You know what, I reckon, maybe I can learn chess? Well, it's just as entertaining as it looks! \n4. Watching movies - I like watching romantic movies when I'm stressed, horror movies when I am feeling happy, action movies when I have free time, and sad movies so that I can feel that I have a reason to cry several times a year.\n\nI'm sure I still have more, I just don't remember as of the moment.\n\n**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI learn best when I'm experiencing it myself. Often in sports, I just don't rely on the instructions, I have to practice it myself, though I admit knowledge does come from reading first (principles). I often struggle with PowerPoint presentation that just contains texts of their own so I often record the class or write down notes the way my teacher explain things and what conclusions I can draw from their statements. I think this was how I survived college. \n\nI dislike memorization for I don't really learn much from it. I like concept reading where I can answer and analyze many situations relevant to the concept. I also use logic to answer them, that's how scientific essays usually work in exams. \n\n**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI don't usually intensely strategize except when I need to manage my time. Because I didn't have an organization that I would lead in college, I was usually free and was able to manage projects without thorough planning. So my plans would usually just live in my head and the default process of tasks is that I would complete the easiest ones and focus on bigger parts later. Even though this would appear slightly spontaneous, I usually don't like improvising. Especially if the time was given before completing a project. Even though I usually don't have thorough plans, I can maintain in achieving a particular goal that I can work on until it's complete.\n\n**What's important to you and why?**\n\nMy family, close friends, and books even though I'm not a bookworm. It's not a hobby, but whenever I'm tired or restless, opening a good book is really like drinking a delicious tea in the morning. \n\nFamily, friends, they're the ones that supported me and were there for me since the beginning. Without them, I think I would not appreciate the world and the happiness it can offer.\n\n**What are your aspirations?**\n\nI really wanted to be a person who could deliver her duty to someone and would make them happy or satisfied. That's why, instead of taking and re-enrolling myself in computer engineering, I wanted to be a doctor. At the current age, I can learn programming if I want to, given the online resources that are accessible, even though I know it would be harder than enrolling myself again. I also wanted to give back to the community and just help other people by performing my best in my job. I want to directly affect them, just like in healthcare. Medicine just fascinates me and being able to actually study for something that I love and that directly affects people would be enough routine in my life. It also involves research which is something I liked when I was in college, though the process going through is not really that likeable. But the feeling after completing it is just a chef's kiss, especially if you see the hard work you did paid off.\n\n**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI am not usually scared of anything, except big spiders and the ocean itself. I even made a vow to myself that I would not travel on a ship. I panic when I cannot touch the sand with my foot. I even panic seeing rocks under me, so yes.\n\nI am uncomfortable being ignored (with friends; I'm numb with my family), when people cut me off when I'm talking, jogging with normal people in the morning (I usually like to be with someone), some intense criticism (from friends and family: would really hurt me), and performing drama (I hate this). These things would make me uncomfortable because they either hurt me or just make me think little of myself. Strangers don't usually affect me as much as the people who I'm close with.\n\n**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nYou will know that I'm in my nice zone if I am considerate, understanding, smiling with no reason (maybe I'm not just aware), and just talkative which is so not me in my normal days. I am so nice which I don't even understand. Also, I can just be sitting reading all day. When I'm focused, I am usually like that. I also don't mind the noise in my environment, I'm just practically calm. I also do not overthink things and let everything go with the flow. \n\n**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI would be angry at all times and be sarcastic to all the people I talk with. I would be honest with what I think and just basically *turn off* my emotions. I also become ruthless, especially when I think someone is not giving me the things that I deserve. I also become a perfectionist and overthink things a lot. I shout at people when they are annoying me and I would hate anything that's unclean and say every little thing I noticed that would not be up to my standard. I would criticize a lot of things and why they exist (not people). I would also become annoyed with everyone not in particular and would act like a smartass to anyone and in my head call them idiots. No kidding, in my lows, I act like a queen (that's angry all the time), even though I am not. And this is contrary to my lowest. \n\nAt my lowest, I would isolate myself for days without contact. I even would deactivate my social media accounts. I just don't feel like talking to anyone. And after days, I would be okay and back to normal. That's where I would share some of my problems (not deep reasons) with my friends and what I felt. You would not appreciate confronting me before I isolate because I would be angry at you for invading my privacy, even though we are close. And my friends understand these things. They are such very lovely people.\n\n**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI think I am very realistic. I do daydream just to escape temporarily from all the stress I just did to myself, but I can easily go back and finish the task I'm working on. When I daydream, I just stare because I can forget where I am, maybe my mind is trying to keep me at rest. I could also be lost in some music, but I would not be aware of my surroundings if that's the case. \n\n**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI would be thinking why I would be there. I mean, who would put me in that room. To be honest, I would try to escape. But if it's something I choose myself to ponder things, I would be thinking about the future. I would really like to talk to my future self if I am following the right path in the present or if I need to switch to another track. I was always not very sure about the path I chose but I am able to hold it firm until someone or something can make me realize that I am wrong. It never happened. That is why I like to talk to my future self if she could reassure me because I am not confident with the decisions I have made and will be making in the future. \n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt would take me days or even weeks to decide, especially if it's a very significant turning point in my life. I also would have done basic research on its consequences if it's possible. I also would ask my friends about it, even though they would not likely help me because our interests would not really align. And when I make my decision, I don't usually change it. It would be very hard at that point to change sides.\n\n**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nJust like when I'm making my decisions, I process my emotions hours to days before I respond to things. I am not very self-aware unlike my friends so I would need constant help checking myself. Emotions are just as important as any other part of me. They are the reflection of my subconsciousness. Something that I'm not aware of, but I'm fully capable of feeling. That is why in some situations, when usually I can't gather enough logical explanations, I would just trust my gut and decide with it. That's why I'm impulsive sometimes. \n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nIn some situations, yes. But NO to most people who would exist in my life consistently even if they were not so close to me. I would try to deliver my point of view. I am not very rash and aggressive in these situations, but I would not lie about my point of view. I would try to gather their views and explain to them why I think the opposite and try to make them understand me, too. And if they refuse to understand, like they would fight to dominate, I would not be elaborating because I know I could just waste my time and I don't like to be involved in conflicts I never aimed to join. There are some situations in which I could say yes because I know I would not meet that person again so setting the impression to them would not be very important. I would try to get out of the conversation with these types of people as easily as I can.\n\n**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nNo. I don't break rules but I think skepticism/criticism towards authority can still be done. And they never know better. I don't also know better. It's just a matter of values. If I think the authority would be abusing their power, I would not hesitate to give them a piece of my mind, especially when it affects the people I protect. However, when it happens to me and it's not affecting anyone else, I can be patient and ignore their shortcomings. I also think that I am capable of breaking the rules but I am just avoiding unnecessary conflict in my life.\n\n**What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nMy ideal life would be a life in which I would not seek approval from other people and those people would not be very judgemental of me. I mean, a peaceful life where people would just be kind and gentler would be enough. I have no materialistic standard for this, just peace overall.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI think these things would be all. I know this would not be enough to know my whole life, but at least I know it summarizes good points of my behaviors and overall experiences with the help of the guide questions. >!I often was identified as INFJ, which I don't relate much.

{"submission": "Everytime I go online and ask for my type with me including some long tangent in depth of my cognitive functions. People describe me as ENFP. But I am so shy In real life and it doesn't convey properly in my text because Im not very in depth or anything. I am extremely socially anxious around people, but I hate being by myself. Yet I find that even though I dislike being by myself, being alone is what I do pretty much 24/7 Im always on my computer to 5 am or whatever on any game or doing something to get dopamine whether thats learning or messing around on a video game. Sometimes I just freak out and think all my friends hate me so then I go online and befreind like 500 people enjoy that dopamine and then never speak to them ever again. \n\nWith people, I can be super energetic but usually with most, I am worried I'll come off as weird and that they'll hate me. I'm also worried that I'll attach to tehm, because I tend to attach to anyone nice to me and obsess over them. I'm 90% sure I have ne, even though I lack imagination, I think I have ideas? just that I'm so scared to talk about them because I feel like I'm dumb.  I have fi, used to be stuck with that because I dont know who I am but I am always just wearing what I want and may have messy hair and I also never wear makeup and stuff I never conform to anyone. But at the same time I always worry when people are being excluded. But also I'm terrible at comforting people. I have si but I hate thinking about my past ,its just triggering but I am the first to notice when the surroundings of an area are different to how they were in the past. I thought I had se like I used to skateboard and parkour but now I just dont notice the present at all, but I'm not in imagination either, I'm just too busy having anxiety to think properly at all. Idk if I worry about 12 diff things or only one thing but Ik that I am not in the present, I dissociate quite a lot. The present just reminds me of the past now. But sometimes I can be very energetic and stuff and I run on adrenaline rushes sometimes. But I also have severe sensory overload. Its not like I think about the future either though... I really dont know. If it helps I also have autism, adhd and ocd.   Ti I score very high on pretty much every test cuz I love accuracy and I learn for the sake of learning a lot. Idk if I have ne because I have no idea how to read between the lines, I tend to overthink bodylanguage and get stuck on things. But Im also very open minded and can see how any idea can be good. Like if someone says that a method is bad I can be like \"but what if it isn't because...\"  so idk. I also did roleplay a lot. I'm pretty much never me, I'm just always feeling like a fictional character so maybe that counts as being in imagination I'm not too sure but thats all I do to cope with reality so... But I also dislike reading...\n\nThese are my most recent results. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs8fc1lgf2mb1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4c541c6268eb001b4c6fa3dc00d4183eb7b5266\n\nhonestly don't think I think outside of the box.

{"submission": " \n\n I paid money to be typed but recently I have had many reasons to believe I was mistyped, so I'm giving my typing another go.  \n\n\nFeedback appreciated, I'm fucking tired of flip flopping between types \ud83e\udd27  \n\n\n**What do you study or do for a living? How did you come to do that? What do you like or dislike about it?**  \nI'm currently studding psychology and ding freelance translations. I've been into psychology since I was a teen so I bit the bullet and decided to try it on professionally after realizing that if it kept my interest so far is because it definitely has a lot of meaning to me.My mom has been hinting ta it for years too, telling me I have a knack for it and I think she's right.\n\n  \n**What else do you do on a daily basis? What are your interests and hobbies? Why do you do them?**  \nI have avery chill routine, wake up and make my mom breakfast before she goes to work, then start on the laundry and have my own breakfast reading the news on my interest fields, start my translations, stop for lunch and watching some Youtube or TikToks, work some more, make dinner and have it while watching some Netlix or something, then study. I love music (I'm specially into Kpop), typology, fashion, cooking and baking competition shows, learning about new cultures,, photography and videography, color theory. I do them because obviously they fascinate me, make me curious and give me pleasure.\n\n  \n**What are your values, and why?**  \nWhat does 'value' mean here? Just what I like or morals? This is super vague but I'll bite: I value truth, I'll take it at any cost, better an ugly truth than a beautiful lie, ignorance isn't bliss is decadence. I value freedom, nothing else has nay meaning or value without it. I value beauty, not just visual but anything that makes you elevated, like you just experienced something that proves the existence of God. I value wisdom, we were given mental abilities so e can learn and knowledge is power, but true knowledge is understanding, not just information. I value honor, be someone worthy of respect, don't do lowly things.  \n\n\n**Describe your relationships with family and friends. What do you like and dislike about them?**  \nI dislike super self centered people to the point where they become a nuisance to others, people who make empty promises, who are hypocrites and apply double standards, who never take responsibility or recognize mistakes, who love to talk badly about others or just won't shut up about other people's lives when I couldn't give a shit, who lie compulsively just to get attention etc.  \n**What do you look for in friends? In romantic relationships?**  \nGood character, honest, personality that is pleasant and interesting to me, give me attention and respect me and my boundaries.  \n**What conflicts have you encountered recently with other people? Why did they happen? Which kinds seem to happen on a regular basis?**  \nPeople who can't decide even simple things like what movie we're gonna watch for themselves, who make careless choices than want to change it at the last second inconveniencing me because they didn't really know hat they were picking in the first place. People who can't communicate clearly and directly about what they want and expect me to guess what they would like hen they don't even know it themselves.  \n**What are your strengths? What do people like about you? What do you like about yourself?**  \nI'm pretty smart and shrewd, it's extremely hard for something to get past me and fool me or catch me off guard without me clocking it miles ahead. I'm very direct and won't sugarcoat things thought in the recent years I have learned to deliver with more tact and care. I'm pragmatic in that I'm realistic and will always call a spade a spade and recognize that what I want and what is possible or more advantageous are many time very different things. I'm very ethical and take a hard line approach when it comes to the principles I believe are nonnegotiable.  \n**What are your weaknesses? What criticism do you often face from others? What do you dislike about yourself?**  \nI'm very inconsistent in my efforts when it comes to taking care of the house or my well being, I can't sustain a diet, exercise routine or house chores productivity schedule for long. I get distracted very easily by things that seem interesting and waste a lot of time jumping from video to video or article to article, my mind is very restless and needs fun most of the time. I used to be too cutting with people and I still am very impatient which at times makes me rude. I have a need to be good at things from the start that has stopped me from even trying some things or putting myself out there with others.  \n\n\n**In what areas of life can you manage well on your own? In what areas of your life would you like help?**  \nI'm good with budgeting, scheduling things, keeping tabs on resources but wish I didn't have to cook and clean everyday.  \n**What things do you dislike doing? What things do you enjoy more than others?**  \nAs already mentioned I dislike house chores and anything that demands waiting, also hen people ask me do to things for them they definitely can and should be doing themselves. I love studying my areas of interest through reading or watching content, analyzing people using typology is also a big hobby of mine.  \n**What goals, aspirations, or plans do you have for the future, and why?**  \nI wanna be healthy and happy, feel in peace with myself. Would love to have much more money and a much more full social life. Being proud of yourself is essential for complete self esteem and I wanna make my dreams reality.  \n**What kinds of things do you do to manage and/or beautify your environment (your room, your house, etc.)?**  \nBesides cleaning not much since I live with my mom so it's not my space so to speak. I do buy a bunch o cute gadgets and kitchen accessories though, they make working more pleasurable My room though I love decorating and ill alter it every new season (I love following a theme like 'all' or \"Christmas').  \n\n\n**If you won the lottery and didn't have to work anymore, what would you do?**Study music and photography, travel constantly, spend a lot on aesthetics.  \n\n\n**What traits do you find endearing that others might dislike? What traits are considered positive/neutral by others but tend to annoy you?**  \nI think shyness is often cute, and I detest conceited people, cockiness is a huge turnoff to me.  \n\n\n**How do you behave around strangers?**  \nThat totally depends on several factors: How are they treating me and others? Are there red flags? Are they boring?  \n**How do you react to conflict? What do you do if somebody insults or attacks you?**  \nI'm very assertive and pretty aggressive by nature so don't expect me to diffuse, I have zero tolerance for passive aggressiveness or childish pettiness. I wanna clear things up ASAP. When insulted if it matters i'll hit them thrice as hard, but if it's something or someone stupid I'll just ignore to piss them off more.  \n\n\n**Would you ever be interested in starting a business? Why or why not? What role would you play in it? What kind of business would it be?**  \nNo I'm not interested in that at all, don't see the appeal,not enough time or focus on me.  \n**How do you dress or manage your appearance?**  \nI'm very into studying body typing systems, personal essence and color analysis, so I care about working with hat I have and enhancing my strongest points. As Epictetus said \"Know first who you are and then adorn yourself accordingly\".  \n**Do you like kids? Why or why not?**  \nNo they usually are disrespectful**,** crude, stupid or really annoying.  \n\n\n**In what situations or times in your life did you feel most fulfilled, and why?**  \nWhen I'm doing something really well specially if there's an audience or when I'm just completely carefree enjoying myself.\n\n  \n**How do you feel about attention? Do you seek it out?**  \nLove it but don't seek it out most of the time, I think is cringe and embarrassing. Besides it only fees my vanity if it's natural.\n\n  \n**Your friend bursts into tears. What do you do? How does it make you feel?**  \nI panic, I have no idea how to console a person as I hate platitudes. I just get a glass of water or hand them a handkerchief, my nature is to offer solutions.\n\n  \n**What is something you regret?**Saying no to many opportunities because I didn't think myself capable and was terrified of failing.  \n\n\n**What are your spiritual or religious beliefs and why do you hold them?**  \nReligion is a tool for control and self delusion, I am spiritual instead.I believe in many things because they are proven or at lest heavily supported by my on experiences, those of other people and because they explain common phenomena.  \n**What kind of work environment do you prefer? What do you look for in a job?**  \nCompetent leadership, clear goals and expectations, defined roles, mutual respect, good resources for workers.  \n**What is or was your favorite school subject and why?**  \nEnglish (not my native language), I was great at that, it came naturally.  \n**What is one common misconception that people have about life? Explain why it is wrong.**  \nThat is complicated, it's not, people just don't wanna accept reality or use their minds.  \n\n\n**What do you do if you're not getting what you want? What approach do you use?**  \nIt totally depends on the situation, but usually I retreat and research, talk to other people, just gather more info or just wait. Timing is everything and sometimes is just not the right moment. Of course that if it's something I need done with urgency I'll compromise and get the next best thing, I'm pragmatic.  \n\n\n**Are you comfortable taking leadership roles? In what areas? Why or why not?**I was a pretty bossy child, then ran from leadership for my years since at school it meant picking everyone's slack and most were both lazy and incompetent, then realized things are better when I run a tight ship. If you want something well done than do it yourself and all.  \n\n\n**How often do you get angry? What kinds of things make you angry?**  \nI get irritated by many things I already mentioned previously often, but angry very seldom.I used to be angry a lot but a few years back I realized it made life heavier so I just started to let go and detached form many things that indeed were irrelevant and inconsequential.  \n**What is your sense of humor like? Do you joke around a lot?**  \nI'm either witty/sarcastic or pretty silly depending on the day, I joke around unless I'm stressed but I'm far from a class clown.  \n**What were you like as a child? How have you changed since then?**  \nSuper curious, asked many questions, a physical explorer, athletic and loved to perform in public and was very perfectionist about it, very active imagination that was triggered by my surroundings (nature), very social, loud and a bit bossy, talked a lot very fast, didn't know how to walk just run, polite and generally obedient, very attached to my dolls and characters in cartoons, very willful and would freely demonstrate displeasure, really worried about being 'bad', kinda Hermione Granger-like (wanted to be the best or at lest great at school and pressured myself to meet standards) emotions that oscillated between being intensely felt or a detachment from them as if it s happening to someone else, sometimes felt deep melancholy and loneliness (as bullied on and off for many years) that wouldn't express but were mirrored by certain songs lyrics. After 7 years of bullying I became very insecure, closed off, anxious and limbic for years. As an adult still working on healing I'm reserved, way less active, hate melancholy. Apart from that, I'm still the same: a weird mixture of hedonistic info junkie and controlling competence focus. ", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "**My Traits (From most negative to most positive)**\n\n* At my worst, I am completely overwhelmed by worry and getting stuck in past experiences because what if I have ruined my life beyond repair and have NOT realized it until 3 years later? I can also become overly worried about painful diseases out of nowhere such as rabies.\n* I sometimes feel the need to repress my thoughts and feelings because if I get exposed, it feels like I have to explain all of my thoughts, especially the toxic ones, one by one, expect doomful judgment, and possibly grounding. And the thing is that, trying to repress actually generates even more anxiety, until I can\u2019t hide it anymore and I feel guilty for my own negative thoughts.\n* I can be rather lazy at times because I can be preoccupied with my identity and excessive amount of self-discovery. (Currently 19 years old, Male BTW)\n* I am rather fussy and easily annoyed by things, such as small details in environment (though they can be funny), and anything harmful to my health, such as secondhand smoke.\n* I tend to envy people who are: Having little to no worries, not obsessed about minor annoyances, able to act quickly without overthinking, automatically satisfied without much work, able to solve practical problems, able to handle stress calmly, trailblazing and acting without worrying about consequences, able to be carefree at all times, and able to be good at everything with little effort (though this can be me, more accurately, people who naturally act on their potential)\n* As for the types I envy the most, they are: ExxPs (especially Ne doms), ExFJs, Enneagram 7, Enneagram 3, Tritypes 137, 278, 279, 378, 379, 478, 479, Sanguine temperament, High IQ\n* I get angry when I feel like I am controlled unfairly for no reason, especially with mundane stuff. It doesn\u2019t become rage, but I feel the need to confront sometimes.\n* I make mental associations and find similar characters, objects, concepts, and many others in order to better understand myself and feel better as well. For example, my personality is similar to this YouTuber, this animal, this PC component, etc.\n* I have highly detailed memories and people appreciate me for that. Sometimes, I enjoy reliving my memories, and make associations with music, concepts, and gain inspiration.\n* Having a sense of purpose and efficiency is important but I end up learning a bunch of things just for the sake of it without practical purpose. I guess learning itself is just fun and efficiency comes after all that.\n* While I cared about being a good person, it wasn\u2019t perfect and I had a lot of wild moments. I would stress test devices out of sheer curiosity, take apart stuff, go to obscure places, etc.\n* I can adapt to a wide range of learning styles, such as visualizing it, relating it to other topics, interactive learning, etc. What I don\u2019t like is boring memorization with no real value (as ChatGPT is a thing), too much repetition, and most importantly, intolerance to innovation. It\u2019s super infuriating when you must use pencil and paper when you can use an iPad Pro.\n* As for the assignments, I am fine with unclear assignments when there can be loads of interesting ideas and creativity is valued. But if the professor is giving an unclear assignment with only one right way, it\u2019s like you are throwing darts until you find the right way. Or you don\u2019t. I also don\u2019t like overly strict assignments and mountains of boring homework.\n* For me, knowing the consequences are very important, though I sometimes fail to see consequences, it is still important for me because if I do something without knowing the consequences and I realize them way too late, it feels like unavoidable doom is coming. \n* I make a point in being honest and frank with my things. If I become too dishonest and secretive, I feel like a bad person at first and eventually, unavoidable disaster will derail me.\n* My relation with rules: Too many useless rules will annoy me. Of course, I would follow the laws by proper authorities, especially if they are fair, and also due to the fear of being trapped in dire consequences. When I\u2019m breaking them, it\u2019s usually because of forgetting them, or assuming it isn\u2019t there. With social etiquette, I am far more rebellious. And with the stupid rules made by regular people just to hold others back, I secretly rebel a lot of the times. I am never directly arguing unless I am caught and the rule is REAL stupid.\n* When I see a mistake, I am quick to point it out and fix them. I even used to march into the cashier\u2019s desk in order to learn all the details about that computer, and change the screen resolution so everything becomes clearer. Of course, I would do it in a good and casual way.\n* While I have a good amount of my favorites, I enjoy trying out new things in order to challenge myself and make the experience more meaningful. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t return to familiar stuff.\n* I don\u2019t work steadily, but rather, when I want to. It\u2019s like I do what I feel like I want to do at the moment rather than complying with a strict schedule.\n* I was individualistic throughout my life, and enjoyed working alone way more than in teams, because when I work alone, I have more freedom and control over the project, and I used to be quite shy when I was a child.\n* I care a lot about getting along well with people and understanding them. But I sometimes fail to do that and maybe say something \u201csharp\u201d on accident, or forget to take care of my hair.\n* I often do something new and exciting in order to challenge myself, learn new things, and maybe let that mental chatter go away. When I am not learning, I feel stuck and just surviving.\n* It\u2019s very important for me to make the ideal decision, which it makes me slow to make decisions at times. I need the ideal experience rather than many subpar experiences.\n* I am often capable of doing truly spontaneous stuff when I\u2019m feeling great such as starting a new language, doing a new type of workout, and create content, all on the same day.\n* I am intellectually curious and I love learning new things. A day without learning is wasted life.\n* I feel better when I am able to solve an intellectual problem or a challenge. They make me feel motivated and make me push forward.\n* I would really like to interact with the world around me and try them out. I used to hate boring lectures where you take notes by just writing what the teacher says and there\u2019s no meaningful learning involved there.\n* I am considered as sociable and enthusiastic, and I can talk about a great deal of topics, either picking up new things from my environment or my own fun knowledge. It can create funny moments and light-hearted enjoyment.\n\nI\u2019m kinda tired so that\u2019s all for now. ", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm a 27-year-old woman. I would describe myself as reserved, task-oriented, and respectful of others. I get stressed easily, but I'm also very calm and laid-back. I'm a good listener and I really enjoy playful banter. If I'm being totally honest, I'm not the most exciting person out there. I'm not excitable or outgoing, and I'm not much of a risk-taker. I'm ok with that, though.\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was pretty standard. I'm an only child and I have older parents who are pretty religious. I shared their beliefs until I was in high school, at which point I started going in more of a spiritual direction.\n\n* **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI work in manufacturing and I really love it, although I don't want to do it forever. This is the first job I've had that isn't related to customer service, and it's a nice change. I really enjoy setting goals for myself and slowly rising to the top. Since I'm training to go into a type of management, I'm also being mentored and learning a \\*lot\\* about leading a team, and that experience has kinda turned my life around (for the better).\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI'd feel refreshed. When I'm going through a lot of stress or dealing with negative emotions, I isolate myself as much as possible for a few days/weeks/however long I need, and just reflect and keep myself entertained with books, shows, music, and games. It might not be the healthiest way of dealing with stress, but I can definitely think of worse ways. Plus, it got me out of a bad slump earlier this year.\n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?**\n\nI'm definitely not a sports person, but I do enjoy fitness and being active. I especially like weight-lifting and going on nature walks.\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nAbsolutely. I have a lot that I could improve on, but I sometimes train people at work and I think I'm becoming a pretty good leader. My leadership style is helpful and motivational. I really enjoy giving encouragement and positive feedback. However, my communication style when training or giving direction is very straightforward, and I sometimes worry about coming off as irritated or intimidating to more timid types of people (especially because I used to be very timid and unsure of myself).\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI think it's important to learn from the past, make the most of the present, and plan for the future. The one I struggle with most is the future. There are so many uncertainties in life that I sometimes see careful planning as a waste of time, even though I know it's important.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nOf course I'm more inclined to help with annoying or stressful tasks if the person asking is someone I'm close with, but generally speaking, I help others when asked as long as the request isn't a huge inconvenience (ie. I'm only waking up at 5am for a small handful of people). I don't really think about why I help others; I guess if I can make someone's life a little bit easier, why not do it?\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes. If my beliefs, values, or decisions are inconsistent or incompatible with each other, I feel the need to reevaluate them. I'm actually going through something like this right now: I have some spiritual and \"new age\" beliefs but I've also recently adopted the philosophy of existentialism. I'm not sure if these beliefs conflict with each other (due to contrasting ideas about cosmic justice) or if they are compatible (both are partly based on the idea that we each control our own destiny).\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nExtremely important. I take a lot of pride in my efficiency and productivity.\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI play video games, especially open-world RPGs and roguelikes. I like immersing myself in the world of whatever game I'm playing, and I also think it's fun to play around with different builds and weapons. I also spend a lot of time listening to music, like limiting distractions and just getting lost in the beat or the lyrics. I'm not sure why I like to do this, but I always feel better after listening to a really good album.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI learn best with a combination of hands-on experience and hearing (lectures, discussions, videos, etc). I struggle with learning environments that depend heavily on independent reading. For example, reading a chapter in a textbook is alright, but I benefit more from a break-down of key points and practical examples.\n\n* **What's important to you and why?**\n\nPersonal growth is important to me. I want to be constantly learning and evolving. If I'm not growing, I just feel like I'm in a slump, or aimlessly wandering through life. Deep emotional connections are also important to me. I'm not a very social person, but relationships in which I can be vulnerable are actually priceless.\n\n* **What are your aspirations?**\n\nI want to continue building my career and become an HR manager. In general, I would really like to be in a position where I can inspire others one day.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nOne of my fears is losing the deep personal connections I have with a small group of people. I generally try not to care about what other people think, but there are exceptions, and sometimes I literally have nightmares about certain people getting mad at me. Excessive affection, especially romantic affection, makes me uncomfortable. I'm open to having relationships, but I just *can't* handle the grand gestures and overly sentimental stuff. It just seems so forced and, on a certain level, insulting. I hate when people either lack self-awareness or just have no regard for other people. I am *especially* irked by people who think it's ok to treat others poorly just because they're in a bad mood. Don't get me wrong, I occasionally get snappy when I'm stressed, but I just mean straight-up giving everyone dirty looks, ignoring people, etc.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nDuring the \"highs\" in my life, I have a healthy support system and am working toward something. I'm at a \"high\" right now.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe \"lows\" in my life can get pretty dark. I lose motivation to the point where I don't follow up with basic chores or hygiene. I gravitate toward toxic and manipulative people. This usually happens when I feel like I don't have any direction in life. I was at a \"low\" for a little over half a decade and I'm determined to never go back.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt depends on the decision, but it usually doesn't take me very long to decide on important things. I think about my options until something just \"clicks\" and I know what I want to do. I can't think of an example, but I think I would definitely at least be open to changing my mind if I had new information or thought about factors that I hadn't considered before.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me a while. I tend to go emotionally \"numb\" when a highly emotional event happens, whether it's good or bad. I don't feel anything for a few hours or days, and then the feelings slowly sink in.\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNot usually, but I will try to find common ground or even just nod and say, \"I see where you're coming from,\" if I don't think a deeper discussion will be productive. \n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI do not break rules often or really ever. I have mixed feelings about authority; it's something I value, but I also think it's important for authority figures to be open to feedback and earn respect instead of just expecting it.\n\n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nI haven't figured that out yet.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "This is probably going to be a little messy, but here are a list of traits that I have noticed in myself.\n\nI think what people often note about me is that I am very laidback and agreeable on the surface, but also very intense underneath. Should note that this agreeableness is not really the people pleasing \"oh I am happy with whatever you are happy with!\" kind of behaviour, moreso adaptable and willing to try other things, so more of a \"oh, that sounds like a good idea, I'll hop on that train too\" kind of tone. However, I do have my own agendas and beliefs of what is right and wrong, so I can seem flexible UNTIL something crosses those personal values and then I become stubborn and tenacious. Another way it can show up is I can seem like I am just adapting to the situation, but in reality I am leveraging the circumstances for my own ends, and people don't realize that/couldn't see it until afterwards when they step back for the bigger picture.\n\nI realized the other day that my best and worst trait all have to do with the same problem I have: I am very terrible at prioritizing. Everything seems important to me. As such, at best, I tend to be great strategist or tactician, plotting out a plan that takes care of EVERYTHING, every angle, every person, every detail. All planned out so we do not have to make any sacrifices. At my worst, I procrastinate or become a complete multi-tasking mess because I simply cannot decide on what to do first, thus end up in a deadlock or trying to do too many things at once.\n\nI think I find the idea that \"the world is just the way it is\" very offensive. I am obsessed over the idea of transformation, alchemy, and shapeshifting. I love the idea of getting to control how things are to your very whims. To be able to shape the world and yourself to your heart's content is something that I have fantasies about. However, this does mean that I get frustrated implicitly when people tell me things just have to be a certain way.\n\nI am generally a man of action. When I can have a clear goal, either because I finally got around to prioritizing properly or because the situation did it for me through emergency or a very angry boss, then I can be very decisive with my actions and I am not afraid of tiredness or frustration. What matters is that I am working and I am in the right direction. My mother noted once that she found me happiest when I was busy yet not chaotic, and I am inclined to agree.\n\nI am a little self-absorbed, admittedly. My thought processes are often all about my own introspections, projects, and developments. The going-ons of the world is off secondary concern. This often means I can be having a good day because my projects are on the right track, only to suddenly realize I forgot to check in with family and friends for a few weeks. Or I may be making progress with self-development, but totally forget to read the news to get the latest on world events. There is often a sense of \"what does this have to do with me\" that I instinctively feel about news, and so I often have to reason myself into caring about the world. (everything impacts finance, could be good socializing topic, etc.)\n\nI definitely like sciences more than humanities and commerce. I like things that are definitely true and logical. People don't always compute for me, even if I do my best to be polite and empathetic. I think that's more so my own fault for being too task-oriented sometimes. Not that I come across as blunt or cold, mind you. I have gotten good at memorizing what you're supposed to do in certain social situations. (e.g. just quietly practice active listening if you notice someone here to vent rather than wanting to solve problems.) BUT this is still memorization of \"correct answer\". I don't fundamentally understand the need to vent, if I'm fully honest. I think I just treat socialization as a fun puzzle, both in the sense of \"can I handle this situation gracefully\" and \"can I figure out how their mind works\". I love trying to probe what people's central motives and values are. It's fascinating how even very close people can have wildly different answers.\n\nThat being said, for work, I would much rather be working on something more logical. For example, if I, a programmer, ever get the chance to get a promotion, I most likely would go for architect and then CTO route rather than manager and then CEO route. I need my work to be mostly logical and technologically based. That is where I find fun but also where I find comfort.\n\nI can often daydream when I am not actively doing anything. Usually this is daydreaming some kind of action film scene that could happen in this situation I am in, (e.g. if I am in a bus, what if it flips, how would I react that would look cool yet be practical) or it might be based on a piece of fiction that I know of, also action genre. (e.g. daydreaming about what mask I would use if I was in the world of Hotline Miami)\n\nI don't know if I am really extroverted or introverted, socially speaking. I can deal with people okay, and I know how to initiate conversations, but I don't know if I really get drained or energized by it. I will say that I absolutely love hanging out with a small group, especially one-on-one time. That's because this is the time when all the secrets and truth comes out. People admit to their insecurities, dreams, passion in ways that they could never dream to say in places with a lot of other people. I like that truthfulness. Hanging out with a lot of people is irritating because now everyone is playing the social game and everything feels so......fake. I can stand being alone, but being with a small group is ideal. So I guess my preference goes small group > alone > large group. (to me small group is 3 and under. More than that and people start to play social games in my experience)\n\nI noticed in a conversation with some of my friends that I tend to be more cynical of other people's intentions than most people. I seem to default to thinking that everyone necessarily only care about their own priorities and plans, and you only value to them IF it fits their agenda. If you're now thinking \"this guy is projecting real bad\" then you'd be right. That's the conclusion I came to as well. However, this does mean that altruism or even just caring for the sake of caring doesn't exist in my worldview. Great example of this was in college one time a few of our friends were hanging out together and I had to leave early after having downed a few beers. One of my friends turned to me with a very genuinely concerned face and asked if I was okay and I just stopped in my tracks. For some reason I was completely not expecting her to care about me in that moment. I couldn't calculate any personal benefit for her to ask me that, so I just froze for a few seconds before recovering and saying I'll be okay. That's how bad my cynicism is sometimes. To be fair, I was raised with a somewhat social darwinist ideology in my family/culture.\n\nI have found that I dislike collaborating with others to some degree. I like having full control over the piece that I am assigned to work with so I don't have to worry about making any compromises to anyone.", "clean_guess": "ENTJ", "llm_guess": " ENTJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am 24 years old and a man, I'd say I'm quite reserved, stoic, and unexpressive, I enjoy exercise in the form of gym, general sports with friends and some combat sports. I've in self improvement for a while now and want to work on becoming better, I've also started a business but haven't worked on it much if at all due to just being lzy. While I don't enjoy my station in life I generally enjoy it, my ultimate goal is to help people on a large scale in some way, mainly through the medium of healthcare or tech or a combination of both. My natural bent is towards large scale societal changes to impact the future generations and improve, though I am also curious about other things such as science and art. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNot that I know of \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nNo real religious structure, aside from a few times where we went to church, Christmas, easter etc, I treated it as part of tradition and didn't mind since I played with other kids there. As I got older I began to value certain traditions and am now Christian. There was a lot of structure from my parents which I appreciated and help me a lot, I apply structure to my own life but I believe a little differently to the one given in childhood.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI studied neuroscience, and have worked in jobs unrelated to it, I didn't like them as they were repetitive boring tasks which had no real difficulty or point, they didn't help me towards my goals, and were just a means to generate income. I seem to prefer more mental tasks probably because they remind me of my study. In future I want to become a doctor, and occupy higher positions within that field. \n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would enjoy it, most of my weekends involve church and seeing others, but a nice weekend, especially getting away in a small city etc would be extremely pleasant and refreshing, I think it'd be a great time to reflect over the events of the week, where I want to go and how my actions impact my direction. Although sometimes hanging out with others during the weekend is good too.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nMy coordination is poor within sports, and like with most things I get better mainly through tons of repetition, e.g with combat sports I practice certain attacks and combos until they feel natural and intuitive. I want to explore more of the outdoor world and also enjoy gym, climbing etc. I do like sports once im good enough to play them. I also enjoy reading, whether it's philosophy or manga etc. I want to get into art as I did it quite often as a early teenager. \n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI definitely have a lot of ideas of what I would like to do and accomplish, I would like to learn to cook gourmet dishes (at least 3-5 in a year),  I want to have an amateur mma fight, I want to build my business, I want to travel often and recreate certain things I see. However I do have plans and structure to help me do these things. My ideas can be a mix of both, It depends on what is inspiring me. I try to narrow down my ideas to the things I like most. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?** \n\nI think in future I would enjoy taking on leadership position, in the past I have been put into them due to achievement and having a direction for my own life which may cause others to want to follow me. I've struggled with leadership positions in not knowing intuitively how to get individuals to follow since im more solitary but I want to build up leadership skills necessary in future. My main way of leading comes through leading through example, being diplomatic and having a vision for the team. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI'm not too coordinated but I'm not too clumsy either. Less so than most people but not obviously so. I haven't worked with my hands in a while but I remember fixing my bike, looking into my car and some product design projects which required use of my hands, they were great for relaxing and focusing on one task. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI used to draw and write poetry when younger but haven't done so in a while I would like to start. When I consume are its usually in music, I don't mind more abstract music or even non serious forms. With paintings I enjoy realism and surrealism. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI don't think too much about the past unless it's to inspire me, the present is great as its readily available to manipulate for a certain more improved future but also to just enjoy. \n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI don't mind too much, can be annoying if I have to leave something im doing at the moment. I would help them due to a sense of obligation. \n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI would say so. \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nDepends on the task at hand, if its just fun then not too much, if it comes to accomplishing certain goals then It is very important in my life, until I reach a point of long term stability, however other than that it should be ok. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI control others possible through actions, I act on certain goals and try to do them regardless of others opinions, this may cause others to do similar.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nCombat sports feel amazing, use of entire body, can be strategic or tactical, constant self improvement, fun to fight others and learn from each other, inspires discipline, can still improve alone, with another person or in a group. I enjoy learning to play guitar and cooking mainly to find other forms of art to enjoy and in future show this to others. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI enjoy sitting down a reading through text to fully understand it, then breaking it down and testing myself. I enjoy competition too. I struggle the most with group tasks and action oriented work, it seems too distracting, to focus on others and what is being done over the content. \n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI'd say when it comes to goals, strategising is fairly straight forward, I start with an end goal or point, break it down into long term, mid term and short term goals/actions, and break it down into weekly/daily tasks with weekly admin check ups. I like to also leave time to wing certain things and improvise. But I do not freestyle most of the time. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nMy aspirations include becoming a doctor, building a business to a high degree within 6 - 8 years with room for more. Retire my family. Then improve other aspects of my life including getting to the peak of my physique, marrying a woman I respect and starting a family. Enacting a specific change on society to help others in future. \n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI fear not being competent enough to help myself and others. I fear not being able to accomplish what I set out to and being restricted to certain ways of living. I hate needless cruelty, one of the few things which makes me quite proactive in doing something about it. I believe it relates to my goal to help others/ world.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nSucceeding, taking in the physical beauty of certain parts of the world around me, helping others in family and celebrating wins of other people.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nAnger, giving in to vices. Not working hard enough. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI daydream very often but am easily able to snap back to reality quickly. I'm also aware of my surrounding when I do so.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI reflect on my future and what I want out of it. I think about my life so far and why it is this way and if this is what I want. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nNot too long maybe a week or so depending on the decision. With reasonable arguments I may change my mind. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nemotions are important to life and the human experience in general. It takes me a while to process mine, I believe they may be quite childish and may need more development in future. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI agree with others point of view and try to offer alternatives unless I have other opinions which might enhance the conversation through discussion. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better?

And values?\n\nTo be a nomad and travel the world going on adventures. As for values, I think the only one I really have, is freedom/honouring others' free will.\n\n3) What do you spend your free time on? What do you daydream about?\n\nDoing a million projects/ideas at once (note: I have ADHD so this may be independent of type), fitness, and self-improvement for sure. I daydream about success half the time, the other half, I daydream about being a literal god lmfao.\n\n4) What would you change about the world, if you could?\n\nDefinitely less red tape and restrictions, and more second chances to people. People shouldn't be barred from life over a drug conviction. The only exception being child abusers/rapists. Off them unceremoniously. People shouldn't need licences for every little thing, and there are too many safety rules imo.

They amuse me most of the time. Even people I dislike (I don't actively dislike anyone unless they've done something against me or a loved one), I kind of get off on purposely annoying them (in a way where I won't get in trouble, that way I can keep doing it. I love the reactions lmao). With people I love, that's different. I can be VERY protective of them, and I put them first when it comes to major decisions (within reason).\n\n6) What limit (i.e. time, gravity, etc.) bothers you most?\n\nfucking EVERYTHING lmfaooo. laws of physics. laws of biology. human-made limits especially; it's pure masochism. This world in general feels like a type of jail that I'm trying to repurpose into a playground lol.\n\n7) What's the biggest thing people don't often notice about you? And why do you think this is?\n\ni'm not as snooty and distant as I might seem (irl). I just have pride issues, so I refuse to give my time/attention to others first because I won't allow anyone to think they hold power over me.

{"submission": "if you've seen a similar description before, it's not surprising, as it's just a much more complete version of it.To begin with, I have absolutely no clear opinion about myself. And perhaps this will be one of the few things in which I am sure. This also applies not only to me as a person, but also to my overall perception and ability to process information. In past reports, I did not write this, since I remembered only recently, but apparently it went on since childhood. The fact is that in my deep childhood I had excellent abilities for self-hypnosis and an equally terrible memory as now, in principle. One way or another, because of this, I confused real events with fictional ones, or simply confused real events with each other extremely often. I sometimes argued with my relatives because of this (they thought that I was deliberately inventing and lying), later I became aware of this problem, based on some facts, so I can write about it now.Anyway, I'll try to go to the description:\n\n1. I am weak-willed and timid. I do not remember exactly my first meeting with a stranger (which is not surprising), but my parents told me that I was afraid of the people around me in childhood, except for my closest relatives. I was even afraid of my own brother. I practically could not talk freely with anyone except them and a couple of people until about 5 years old. Therefore, my parents began to send me to many circles and extracurricular activities. In general, they managed to socialize me, but I acted by adjusting to others (later I got too carried away with him and got into not the most pleasant situations, losing control over them and completely forgetting myself, so now I, before joining a company in communities  , I analyze it, and if it seems to me personally acceptable and comfortable, then I make attempts to adapt).\n2. I also struggle with feelings of embarrassment and shame from early childhood. (I noticed this trend: the more I communicate, the more this feeling overtakes me, being alone and processing all my actions lately). However, the problem is probably not so much in the amount of communication, but in my perception of what I can be ashamed of. I myself do not clearly understand my values, so I'm not sure. I made attempts to ignore my feelings, because sometimes I had to be in a team by force. However, in the end, nothing worked out, I myself do not notice how feelings sometimes cover me. Then I thought that since I can\u2019t change myself, it\u2019s easier to change circumstances and I just try to minimize most contacts. However, there are often outbreaks and I break down, repeating the same mistakes. Heh...\n3. I am a big procrastinator. With difficulty I force myself to do something, again from early childhood, from primary school. Later this problem got worse. I also have a hard time concentrating my attention sometimes even on what may be interesting for me, not to mention complex unwanted material. I am a moral weakling and if some lecture or text seems difficult to me, I automatically switch off and go into my thoughts. Even forcing yourself to deliberately penetrate comes out with difficulty and not for long.\n4. Concerning doubts and a way of adjustment. I was often told that the reason for this may be the lack of support for the expression of one's own desires, personality on the part of the parents, but in my case it was quite the opposite. My parents always tried to develop this in me, they were interested in my desires, but I never really knew what I wanted. Heh:\\_)\n5. I can definitely say that I value emotional and material stability. I am much more comfortable in a permanent environment. I can hardly stand various kinds of trips, I do not seek to change my physical environment. I am also good at recognizing my physical inner sensations, which I often did not like, as I cannot ignore any discomfort, no matter how hard I try. Emotional stability is easier for me to leave to my surroundings, since I myself have problems coping with my feelings, so I always look for the society where it exists by default.\n6. In general, I am almost always aware of my surroundings (at least I do not have complete blackouts in consciousness), but I do it vaguely, almost never delving into its details. So I usually don't default to making up the big picture based on the details around me like people with se-ni/ni-se do. Most of the time, I'm in a semitone in my thoughts. As far as I know, this is the most common case.That's all for now lol. Thanks for reading.

To have a peaceful and organized environment. What are you \u2018\u2019the best\u2019\u2019 at? Reading through people's intentions and knowing how they feel. How do you see yourself right now?

I don\u2019t know for sure what I\u2019ll be doing, I just know I\u2019ll be alive. How do you express yourself? Through my environment. My environment influences my mood a lot so if my environment reminds me of bad parts of my past I might act rude or so on. How do you feel about those near you (family, friends)? I have had a bad relationship with them so I don\u2019t know quite honestly. How do you feel about strangers? I usually care too much about what they think or when I'm overwhelmed I'll be very rude to them. How do you view change/uncertainty? I hate it. It makes me feel weird like I start to question other things too or just stress about the change. How do you make decisions? Based on how others would react to it and objective facts. How do you solve logical problems? Using objective logic. How do you deal with your emotions? I bottle them up until I cannot hold them in anymore and explode on people. What drives you in life? What do you look for? The thing that mainly drives me in life is peace and comfort. What do you hope to accomplish in your life? Again I just want an organized and peaceful environment as I don\u2019t do well in chaotic environments because they overwhelm me. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you? I avoid being weird and avoid doing stuff that makes me feel out of charecter. I have too many values to put here. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself? I want others to see me as normal or average. I want to fit it but also have my own style at the same time. Describe how you experience each of: a) Anger; b) Shame; c) Anxiety A. I usually bottle it up until I say something hurtful. B. I usually hide it or have a saddening look on my face. C.

{"submission": "Hello. Oh  no, writing stuff about myself?! I don't even know who I really am..... or do I? Guess I should have kept my username Eternallyconfused instead, haha. So I'll just use this life saving guide prepared by yall.\n\n \n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nSheltered upbringing. Surrounded by the 4 walls of the room. School was the only activity I had. Became more and more quiet. Slowly lost all friends and didn't really know what to talk about and how to behave like a kid of that age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nLonely. Bored. Even though weekdays can be tiring and I look forward to the weekends....I've observed that spending whole day by myself makes me feel cranky and low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nI love swimming and have self-trained myself watching youtube videos. Dont know how to play any other sport so cant comment on the same. I read and try to learn new things, but after a certain period of time I find it really difficult and might get fidgety and irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am quite curious and tend to think of doing new things. I've even tried making Youtube videos while I was stuck at home for a while. I think its more environmental as I keep thinking about creating something with my hands or to go out and interact with the environment outside. I like understanding concepts and questioning them.  I follow stoicism and find it to be quite helpful and interesting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nYes. But I don't like ordering people. I would do my own bit but make sure others are doing their bit too and that their opinions are also being taken into consideration while taking a decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nIm not really sure about that. Most of the times I am stuck in my room with my thoughts which can make me overthink n feel a bit lost which is quite common and natural. But yes, I like working out when I do and feel better and in control of my surroundings when I move more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI like helping people. I guess, I like being needed. But if they repeatedly ask for help, it gets a lil annoying coz they are just using me then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nIt is important. I feel disappointed in myself if a day passes by and I do nothing of value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI don't like it when the speaker is continuously speaking and we are supposed to just listen to them and understand. I like interactive sessions where I'm a part of the process. Also I'm not a fan of rote learning. I like visualising and find flowcharts, mind maps etc to be useful too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI used to fear a couple of things, but now I don't. It was difficult to put myself out of my comfort zone and face it but now I feel great. But there is one thing I fear and sorta dislike... and that is flowers. I dont know why. Other pet peeves of mine are: unnecessary talks, interruptions while speaking, very loud people and hypocrites.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nUsed to, as a sort of escapism. Still do sometimes when really bored or stressed. But I'm aware of my surroundings while I daydream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nDepends. I struggle with indecisiveness sometimes but I'm trying to overcome it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI sometimes used to. But usually I say my point only when I think its worth it. Otherwise, I just ignore n stay silent or try to change the topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI usually follow rules as they are made to prevent chaos. But if something doesn't make sense, I simply try not to follow it or raise my concern. I do not pick unnecessary fights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nI want to experience as many things as I can in this short time I have. My ideal life would be to do as I please without being controlled or forced to live as others want me to. I'd Like to spend more time with nature and explore this world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, Thank you for reading this lengthy post of mine.

But please help me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nHello! I\u2019m 17F, have ADHD, the type I usually get in tests is INFP, ENFP & ENTP follow closely behind. My enneagram is possibly 4w5 & my tritype is 458(?) I enjoy dabbling in all things art from drawing, to music/singing, to theatre, to writing, comics/manga, shows/anime, movies, and much more that I don\u2019t want to think too hard abt, but you get the idea. Even as a child, I\u2019ve always saw myself as a soul within this meat suit just floating through life. An observer of sorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI have very strict traditional Asian parents who are very religious. (ESxx mother & ENTP father) Thankfully I\u2019ve researched about my own religion enough to separate culture from religion and know when they\u2019re parading culture or their own ideals as \u2018religion\u2019 and I\u2019ve always strongly retaliated to it, which has gotten me in trouble with my parents many a time. Other than that, my parents parenting style was.. all over the place. There was no proper structure, if anything it was *lacking* in structure. No specific dinner time, chores were divided randomly and quickly neglected, and any attempt to have any kind of structure would all end in vain since nobody in my family is ever on time to anything nor can they conform to a schedule. I used to be very neutral about the unstructured thing, it was all I ever knew, and in a way I saw my freedom in that sliver of a grey area. But sometimes my parents constant lack of stability does bother me, especially when *I\u2019m* expected somewhere and have to rely on them only to come egregiously late. A lot of their parenting also seemed to hinge on using intimidation in order to gain obedience, but after a while I learned to ignore it anyway & became better at hiding things from them. As the saying goes, strict parents make sneaky kids. Although don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t abstain from some nice malicious compliance before rubbing it in their face;)\n\nI was also completely online schooled for my entire life so I grew up on the internet, and my parents didn\u2019t take steps to socialize me or my siblings, so I had to take my own initiative to learn the social game all on my own\u2014 albeit rather late for my age. Nothing will bring back all those pivotal years I\u2019ve missed of understanding the social structure, and even more-so as a neurodivergent person, but it is what it is and I\u2019ve done the best I could with the cards I was dealt. (or at least I hope)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What career path are you interested in pursuing? \n\nEither in art or science (specifically biology pertaining to the natural world, biologist, botanist, marine biologist, etc). Art is a hobby, a passion of mine, which is why I\u2019m unsure about taking it as a career. I fear it might make me lose my passion for it, it\u2019ll become a chore rather than a de-stresser. If I did take art, I\u2019d be a concept designer or character designer since those bring me joy, but it doesn\u2019t pay as good as science either.   \n\n\n*  If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nDepends. If I have been stressing myself out and hanging out with too many people I\u2019ll *need* that weekend to relax and realign myself. If I haven\u2019t spoke to people in a long time and I\u2019m going to have to spend a whole weekend alone, I\u2019d likely be very lonely, buuut I can self entertain and make the best out of it and forget about it in no time. But I can go a long time before reaching that utterly lonely point, it kind of just hits me one day how alone I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI\u2019m very dissociated from myself and reality. I\u2019m always lost in a thought, although I can never recall what since I have the memory of a goldfish. I lose some grasp of reality when I daydream and have to get torn out of it, the world around me just becomes a buzz when I\u2019m zoned out.   \n\n\n*  What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nRelated to my previous point, I have to make an effort to be in sync with the real world, I have to remind myself I\u2019m a real person and push myself out to capture memories or the feelings of the moment, but even then it\u2019s like sand slipping past my fingers. I do like being immersed in the natural world, but as the background to zoning out or to tuck it away into my lil folder of creativity in my brain. There\u2019s something about it that soothes some deep part of my soul and puts me at ease, I used to love playing or studying outside even if it meant playing alone for hours. I\u2019m unable to do that now, but the natural world still brings me comfort.   \n\n\n*  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would call myself a very curious creature, I can thread thoughts and string out a whole web of ideas in no time. I like exploring everything or falling into a million rabbit holes at 3 am. It\u2019s usually hypotheticals that I explore, \u201cwhat would happen to earth\u2019s tidal & oceans if the moon was destroyed\u201d, \u201cwhat would life be like if 95% of the world was covered in water\u201d, and more. I also love exploring real life phenomena, or stupid cryptid shit with that little kid at the back of my mind hoping more than anything that they exist even if I know better. I also love anything about extinct animals, especially ones humans weren\u2019t able to document well like prehistoric animals or dinosaurs. I think I gravitate towards hypotheticals and things just beyond reality because I love that gray area of not knowing the full truth for absolute certain and being able to freely imagine what it could be like. \n\nI also love learning about things so I can use them as inspiration, like I use all my knowledge of evolution and anatomically accurate animal biology I\u2019ve attained to make mythical creatures in my worlds seem like real creatures.   \n\n\n*  Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI\u2019m currently somewhat in a leadership position right now, I\u2019m the VP of one of the biggest clubs in our school. I like to think I\u2019m better at taking an adviser role in leadership rather than the final decision maker. I am more than happy to dump my never-ending supply of ideas and have someone else refine it down or make decisions. However, if I was forced to pick just one idea at gunpoint\u2026. I might as well already be 6 feet under.   \n\n\n*  What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI\u2019m both afraid of and look forward to the future, it\u2019s too unpredictable but there\u2019s also so many opportunities!\u2026 but oh god there\u2019s so many opportunities\u2026 what am I supposed to do?? What if I make a single incorrect choice that ends up messing everything up for me? What if I completely miss an opportunity because I didn\u2019t grasp for it in time? The future gives me strife so I prefer not to think of it too hard or I might actually lose what\u2019s left of my sanity. \n\nThe past I hold dearly, especially my childhood, I\u2019d do anything to turn back time. I think that\u2019s a coping mechanism lol. I analyze my past and how it affects me now, I even make connections on why I act the way I do because of my past.\n\nPresent, I don\u2019t really know what I do. I exist. I try taking opportunities as they come, but I also just live in silence in my own head most of the time. To be honest I\u2019m not really sure *what* I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf it was my friends I would do anything for them, drop everything, even if it means putting them above family. Keep in mind that\u2019s only out of my own will, I *want* to do that, if I didn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t even bother offering or accepting. I like making the people happy or just make their lives easier, it fulfills me. Just in general with anyone, I just trust my gut. If I want to help them, I will do everything in my power to, and if I don\u2019t want to I won\u2019t get out of my way too. More often than not I\u2019ll want to as I see it as a fun challenge and if I do accept you bet your ass I will disregard my entire life schedule to help until things are solved.   \n\n\n*  Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI have a reasoning for a lot of the things I do, I don\u2019t like doing things with no reason behind it (but I find myself doing that more often than not). I have a subconscious that figures things out for me and every time I purposely didn\u2019t listen to it I\u2019ve messed things up for myself. I kind of need a rule of some kind to something, even if small, just so I understand the parameters\u2014 or if something doesn\u2019t have any written rules but has a pattern, I feel the need to vaguely follow that pattern or I feel I might do something wrong. But I\u2019m also always very open to new ideas or concepts to expand my worldview, so I never see anything quite as set in stone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nRarely. I think I get controlling if I get invested in or feel strongly about something, or someone took something I was looking forward to doing. Example: say I worry heavily about cleanliness, if I see someone I know washing a dish sloppily I\u2019d probably start nit-picking the way they\u2019re washing it because I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to get sick from eating from that dirty dish. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s something out of my control and I worry it isn\u2019t going to be done properly to it\u2019s fullest, and since I can\u2019t do anything my reaction is to try and fix it or mold it to my vision even if it\u2019s not exactly my place to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nSince I have ADHD settings where I can see a clear examples playing out and I prefer a clear explanation behind it, so I can break it down to a formula in my head and reuse it later to a somewhat related thing that I can reasonably guess follow that same pattern. However, I prefer classes where I don\u2019t have to think too hard, it just comes to me naturally or I can use common sense to figure out the answer easily. So I suppose that\u2019d be classes that help me utilize logic & creativity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI\u2019m good at strategizing, especially for others, but I\u2019m unable to follow through on my own since my motivation drips down the drain really easily. I will say maybe I tend to overestimate how much I\u2019ll be able to do since I can\u2019t gauge myself that well and end up feeling disappointed in myself. I usually end up procrastinating until the very last second where I grind it all out at once, and somehow I work better this way.   \n\n\n*  What's important to you and why?\n\n1. Treat others like how you want to be treated (literally). A more extreme example (that I do) to get my point across: I\u2019d like people to call me out on my shit, so I call people out on their shit. \n2. My friends are incredibly important to me, sometimes irrationally so. I\u2019m very picky about who I keep around or close to me, so if I approve of a friend they\u2019re a friend for life. \n3. My art & work. It\u2019s something I work hard on that I\u2019m proud of, it\u2019s also meaningful to me. \n4. Being valued in a dynamic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What are your fears? \n\nI\u2019m afraid of being a bad person. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m a self absorbed prick, or that I make people feel bad, or that inherently at my core I\u2019m not a good person and I\u2019m masquerading my entire identity. Obviously it\u2019s not black and white like that, but it truly is something that eats away at me sometimes. To be fair, I suffer from confidence issues and anxiety so I worry about a lot of things. I over-analyze every single thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\n*  What makes you uncomfortable?\n\nI can\u2019t stand it when people have pre-conceived notions things about me out of nowhere. Especially if they try to push it on me when all they\u2019ve seen is a fraction of my life, they don\u2019t have the right to define or label me. I like knowing what people think of me light-heartedly, but when it leaks through that was what they genuinely thought of me it just. Ugh. It just rubs me the wrong way, you wouldn\u2019t catch me dead doing the same. Another thing I don\u2019t appreciate, when I set down a clear boundary and it isn\u2019t listened to even when I draw the line everytime. I\u2019m not your mother, I don\u2019t have to spell out every word for you. But honestly, I\u2019d distance myself before it even got to that point LMAO. I also find it weird when people feel *strongly* about certain things, just so blindly. Like \u201cI **hate** dogs\u201d, just an example but it\u2019s like? How can you make such a strong statement about something so general? Something that makes me panic, when people decide things too quickly without thoroughly looking through all the options fully to know which one will end up being the best possible option in the end. I will never get tunnel vision. Something that **actually** bothers me, when people take things others have confined to them and spill it to everyone else like it\u2019s their business. Even if you think it\u2019s not that deep, it was never *your* choice how deep it is to THEM, when your given information just assume they wouldn\u2019t want you to tell anyone unless CLEARLY proven otherwise. \n\n*  What do you hate?\n\nI hate arrogance, ignorance, closed mindedness, self-absorbed people, or just in general anyone who acts like the universe is centered around them and will listen to their every beck and call. I hate it when people speak sickly sweet words to you and speak ill of you behind your back with that same tongue. If you have a problem, you say it to my face. I hate being stifled, my voice being dismissed, not allowed to do what I want to do with *my* life. Having to live out someone else\u2019s expectation for me. I hate it when people walk past people suffering or in need of help but either don\u2019t see it worth their time or are afraid of what other people think. I hate it. I could go on, but I hate the cynical mindset it puts me in so I prefer to ignore all this exists in order to keep my hope in humanity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI\u2019d probably get bored or uncomfortable since I don\u2019t like sitting in my thoughts for too long due to my level of overthinking to the point I\u2019m constantly distracting myself with things so I\u2019m physically unable to, but I\u2019d explore my thoughts, memories, stories, and characters. And probably have a meltdown.   \n\n\n*  How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nForever. I was never really given control over my own life due to controlling parents, and I think that affects my decision making skills. I\u2019m completely unable to choose anything on my own unless I\u2019ve had the opinions of others and talked it through to truly figure out how I feel about it. Even then, the edge of my mind is always wondering if I even made the right decision in the end. I do obviously weigh the pros and cons and figure out what *feels* right to me, but I will doubt my choice no matter what. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI find myself not realizing how much something effected me until I suddenly process it randomly and it just.. *hits* me. And it crashes down on me. But after I realize it I\u2019ll start dissecting it in order to figure out why I felt that way and why it had such an effect on me. I think emotions r great, feel \u2018em, live \u2018em, leave \u2018em. I believe emotions should run their course because if they get bottled up they\u2019ll boil over much worse than before. And at that point it gets sticky because you can\u2019t control who you\u2019ll explode on, so it\u2019s better to understand them than hide them. It\u2019s called being \u2728healthy\u2728\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nMost of the time I\u2019ll politely disagree and explain my viewpoint, or even if I agree I\u2019ll point out another perspective on that same issue so we could have a nice open discussion. Although, if I\u2019m done with them & realize this conversation is going nowhere fruitful I\u2019ll try to end it there. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll get into a heated discussion with them and probably tarnish my image to them even if on my end I genuinely didn\u2019t care about it that much. The only time I catch myself agreeing just to agree is if it\u2019s someone I just met so I give them the benefit of the doubt, but if I feel *very* strongly about something I wouldn\u2019t blindly agree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nI don\u2019t believe rules should be broken often because they\u2019re there for a reason, but if you genuinely feel it goes against everything you stand for there\u2019s no point listening to it. If I broke a rule it\u2019d be for something that caused mine or someone\u2019s natural rights to be violated by these rules, authorities aren\u2019t perfect & can be corrupt and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d just let that slide just because of their position. I wouldn\u2019t be loud about breaking the law because I wouldn\u2019t want to face repercussions, but I\u2019d do it to protect or save someone even if it meant putting my life on the line in order to do so. I think in order for there to be a healthy system authorities *need* to be constantly questioned and challenged even if they\u2019re objectively right.   \n\n\n*  What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nHappy, healthy, making excellent bank, beautifully decorated cottage at the edge of the British isles with a forest in the back and a beach in the front. Adopted kids, married or single, feeling fulfilled in what I do or how I\u2019m living, a self-sustained garden, having family or friends near me, raising our kids together like siblings. Constantly traveling with my girl friends or spouse. Living idly and comfortably to its fullest. ", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "She is my former middle school science teacher (and she has actually taught middle school science for a fair amount of time. I had her for seventh and eighth grade. \n\nI remember that she tended to specifically like hands-on activities in the classroom herself, and I think she once mentioned that this was the way she tended to learn things herself. I remember that my former best friend (ESFP?) disliked her, as she regarded this teacher as being too strict/not letting them having enough fun. A lot of the kids in my grade did not like her, but my grade was particularly toxic, so I\u2019m not sure that this actually matters a whole lot. I remember that my former best friend regarded her daughter as being a \u201cbrat,\u201d though I must note that my former best friend had said this in part because her daughter once shoved her, and that I don\u2019t have the impression that her daughter has turned out badly (she does strike me as being an involved parent. Interestingly enough, she was with her husband for about a year before they had their first child, and I don\u2019t have the impression that they have an unhealthy marriage.) She has two children, a daughter and a son, and does post them sometimes on her social media. I would say that she is average looking (not \u201cthin,\u201d but I would guess that this is moreso because she had two kids at a later age - she was born in 1971 - more than anything else. Her sister is overweight, so perhaps it\u2019s genetics as well. Her husband is overweight, too, and her children aren\u2019t \u201cthin.\u201d) \n\nCome to think of it, I actually seem to remember having the impression that this particular teacher did indeed notice the weight of others - when she met my mother (I get into that more below,) she was immediately judging her for being overweight, and I remember she once noted that someone was \u201cskinny\u201d in class (not a particular student, it\u2019s like a vague memory.) \n\nI was a teacher\u2019s assistant for one of my middle school teachers, and I recall that once my math teacher and a different staff member were having a conversation and one of them suggested that this teacher \u201ctalked\u201d to her, and said this like it was surprising (didn\u2019t say it sarcastically, exactly. She just kind of said it like this teacher was not/is not the type who actively makes an effort to befriend the other staff members - like she was or is the type that may keep more to herself.) This teacher later on suggested when I reached out to her years later that she was bullied when younger, and wants to be an \u201cadvocate\u201d for students who are being bullied. \n\nI mainly remember her now because she nominated me for an award/put my name in for a \u201cmost likely to succeed\u201d award\u2026 and when she met my parents, she read them correctly on the spot. It\u2019s like she knew they were bad people before I ever did. She was judging them as soon as they sat down - she mumbled \u201cew\u201d when my mother who is overweight sat down. She was still polite to them, but did not like them and I knew this. She mumbled \u201che did not turn out well\u201d when my mom mentioned that I have an older brother (my father is an unintelligent alcoholic who I do feel to be noticeably off. Neither of my parents said or did anything particularly abnormal, she just read both correctly, and quite literally did not like them as soon as they sat down.) She somehow understood that my parents weren\u2019t good parents, and I think she suspected my mom to be abusive (she once looked concerned when my mom came up to the school even though she still said hi when my mom said it. I had the impression she thought my mom was abusing me. My mother wasn\u2019t physically abusing me, but I have realized as I have grown older that my mom definitely has the potential to be abusive, and my mom actually has \u201chit\u201d my brother before.) At the time I just thought she was being judgmental, but about a year later my therapist called CPS due to my parents\u2019 failure to act when my brother (who is in rehab) did something gross, and I experienced particular trauma toward the end of eighth grade in part due to my parents\u2019 negligence, so she actually read them correctly. I remember that at one point, during this brief meeting, she briefly had a look on her face like she was wondering how I\u2019d turn out/whether or not I\u2019d turn out well (I think she wasn\u2019t sure.) \n\nShe had forgotten when I reached out about a year later that she had ever met them at all, though, and assumed that I have good parents (I do not have good parents.) \n\nI\u2019m not so sure that she read me correctly, though. I remember I actually owned a gossip account in middle school and cyberbullied many of my classmates (my classmates really did suck, though) but I don\u2019t think she read me well enough to understand that I was doing anything like that (I obviously am not like a sociopath or anything, I\u2019ll just admit that in middle school I was probably one of those people who thought myself to be kinder and more noble than I really was.) \n\nThis is a bio she wrote years ago: \u201cI\u2019ve taught 7th grade science since we first opened up our doors in 2010, but this is my 12th year teaching at this site, and my 17th year of teaching middle school. I initially went to college to become a doctor. I loaded up on science and math classes, but I went to university of Colorado and the mountains were calling to me. By the time graduation was coming up, I decided I needed to travel before I did anything else. I studied for six months in Costa Rica, I graduated, packed up and moved to *won\u2019t specify state* where I would save money and find somewhere else to go. After working and coaching and swimming for 5 years, I realized I enjoyed being around kids and helping them learn and improve upon new things WAY more than I liked working in an office. I went on to get my teaching credential and I\u2019ve been teaching middle school ever since.\u201d (I wrote in won\u2019t-specify-state. She did specify the state herself.) \n\nEven though she is an adult, I suspect that she did have an idea of which students in her class she felt were \u201csmart\u201d and which she felt weren\u2019t (or, well, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I just think that she had an idea.) She sometimes looks awkward in photos. She is active on social media a fair amount actually throughout the day, even if and when she isn\u2019t posting anything/posting pictures of her children. \n\nIn general, I get and always have gotten the impression that she is *somewhat* cynical, but I will note that I don\u2019t think she was someone who didn\u2019t care about children at all.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16dylk0)", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I'm fascinated by the Enneagram and I'm taking a look at MBTI and Socionics now. Before researching too much myself I would like to get some input. I hope it's okay that I'm using a questionnaire that I already filled out for the Socionics sub. As far as I can tell the questions aren't too different.\n\n**Section 1**\n\n*How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?*\n\nWorking is a difficult subject to me. I used to have different jobs (at a bank, as a nurse, in a laboratory), but I usually immedietely felt that this is not it. So I did it for sometimes just days, sometimes a couple months if it was bearable. Now I deliver newspapers at night and highly enjoy that. I work alone, can listen to music/podcasts and just be in my zone. I'm going to start a job working with addicts soon though. That's part of my university degree. My goal for the future is to be self-employed and I'm currently taking the steps to achieve that. I want to be my own boss since most of them fail to be human. Basically our whole system fails to be human and while it's interesting to observe and understand I don't want to be sucked in. I prefer staying alive, most people seem to die more and more as they work those tortured 8 hours a day. I don't mind effort if it's on my own terms or if it's demanded with heart.\n\n*How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?*\n\nThe highest quality fully resonates and comes from an inner place. Force and necessity are part of this world, but they lack the \"holy\" aspect of things that come right from your soul.\n\n*If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?*\n\nI guess I research or ask someone? It depends. Yes, I usually know if I'm better or worse than other people.\n\n*How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?*\n\nAgain: success comes from resonation and an inner place. It's about whatever rises from your soul when you are still or in a flow.\n\n**Section 2**\n\n*What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?*\n\nI usually get a feeling about a whole which would basically be a sum up of a situation or an end of a situation. Yesterday my best friend texted me that she felt sad. I immediately envisioned her sitting in her bed, depressed. L\u00f6st in darkness. Leaving her university. She is undergoing a transformation process at the moment. She is trying to find her own way. Today she texted me that she just had issues with her hormones, but I know what's going on and I'm pretty sure about it. I wouldn't fight about it and I'm open to being wrong, but I'm probably not. So I would say that there is usually a main thing about a whole situation and it's important to put attention to that.\n\n*What does \"logical\" mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?*\n\nIn my personal experience people often use the term \"logical\" to basically shit on anything that's based on emotions or any higher truth. I don't care about logic, I care more about being open to being wrong. In the past I used to be sure of things based on pretty much nothing. That included the weirdest spiritual believes. I experienced that the openness to being wrong made me much wiser. So I'm trying to keep that in mind. Other than that I believe that our intuition and our body tells us what's right. Feelings and thoughts can be a part of that, but they can be deceiving.\n\n*What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.*\n\nHierachies are used to keep people small. Like a boss treating his little slaves like bots. In an ideal world hierachies would be used to split respobsibilities (and getting paid according to that) while still treating everyone like a human being. The worst hierachie in this world is the 0,1% of the rich and powerful. They want us to be dumb slaves and they want more money and power. It's obvious how they are trying to achieve that through literally any system that we have. It makes me feel sick. They make us fight with each other instead of fighting them. They suck the life out of living.\n\n*What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.*\n\nThings having a natural order and naturally being in the same class. Like when I sort my clothes. Some shirts are for going out, some for lazy sundays and some are for very specific situations.\n\n*Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others' ideas?*\n\nI know my ideas are consistent if I follow my intuition. They at the very least are a necessary part of a bigger development then. If I follow what others want I begin to live in chaos. Sadly I'm a huge people pleaser, but I'm working on it.\n\n**Section 3**\n\n*Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?*\n\nI can and I (rarely) have, but there is no point. Anything that doesn't come from within is pretty much worthless.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I have used emotional manipulation in the past. I'm a good liar and I'm good at making myself appear like the sweetest, nicest and also the most helpless person you've met. That combination is extremely powerful.\n\n*How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?*\n\nIf I want something I try to get it. Weird question. I don't use others to get what I want if that's what's trying to be figured out here.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": " I would be more than happy to explain any further for those who have any questions :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?** \n\nYes, I grew up in the Mormon church, and even though I liked and complied with it as a child, It just wasn\u2019t really the place for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m a Barista and I like it for the most part, The problem I have with it at the moment is mostly management and the lack of leadership and accountability for anyone involved it\u2019s genuinely just such an annoyance.\n\n1. **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nRealistically, more like a mix of Anxiety and refreshing, especially if there\u2019s just anything out of the norm.\n\n1. **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI like drawing, writing, outlining, and then like yeah board games with the family or online. I\u2019ve never described myself as being good at sports, nor do I enjoy them, I like the idea of playing baseball but again it\u2019s just the idea. The only outdoor activities I remember doing and enjoying as a kid were mostly fishing and camping but other than that nah.\n\n1. **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nMost of my \u201ccuriosities\u201d seem to be either linked to studies within the humanities and the social sciences, so things like Politics, History, Economics, Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, etc. I don't think I have too many ideas than I can execute, however, some ideas will definitely take a lot longer to draft out and genuinely create more than others, not only that but like for a book it will take even longer with editors and publishers and whatever other nonsense that I\u2019d have to deal with. I would say most of my ideas in nature are much more conceptual, Again most of them are Ideas but to use a basic example from my liberal arts class, I used Carl Jung\u2019s work when It comes to the collective unconscious to find universal symbols or justice and moral acts of what we nowadays would consider being good vs evil. \n\n1. **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI would never admit it but I think I would absolutely enjoy being in some sort of leadership position, I think It would fulfill some of my control freak thoughts. I can only hope to be good at it but I think I would be competent enough. I want to say Tough but fair, I want things to run as effectively and as correctly as possible but I\u2019m fully aware that some ideas and things are blatantly ridiculous, and if someone doesn\u2019t want to comply they shouldn\u2019t have to, as long as justifiable reasons as to why.\n\n1. **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nNo, it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve never been too good at, I suck at throwing, I suck at catching, and I can just be too in my head sometimes to actually be aware of my surroundings at all times. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy working with my hands either.\n\n1. **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nYes, I would describe myself as artistic/creative, the type of art I make would definitely depend on the medium that I am using, like for the rare times that I paint I do so with the idea of making abstract patterns and ideas, when sketching or drawing digitally its more to create a basic idea and concept of a character for a book in my own style based in Japanese games like persona and other different kinds of styles as well.\n\n1. **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nPast**:** I Have regrets and things I wish I could've done better but there's no point in wallowing in them\n\nPresent**:** I try my best to be in the present moment but it escapes me, I zone out a lot\n\nFuture**:** where my head likes to be at the most, pondering ideas about politics, personal life and their consequences, fun, almost existential stuff like that :)\n\n1. **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\ndepends On what it is, if it's an emotional or psychological problem i almost immediately jump right into action and help those in need, if it's something like helping move the couches or other \"physical\" activity then I'll likely roll my eyes but still help anyways, but bitch about it before, during, and after.\n\n1. **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI don't think its that important to me but it's nice to have nonetheless. \n\n1. **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI Would like to be more productive and more efficient, in my life, I think It would help immensely.\n\n1. **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI Don't really like telling people what to do, i think people are perfectly capable of figuring stuff out on their own but if i have to i will say something \n\n1. **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nmbti, Writing, drawing, learning. Why do I like them? Because their interesting and enjoyable, these activities help stimulate my brain.\n\n1. **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nMy learning style is mostly auditory, I enjoy listening to lectures, podcasts, stories, and those stuff. I would say I struggle most with the kinaesthetic learning, idk just being dropped into something and expected to understand what to do is kind of ridiculous to me and that's also the reason I prefer audio learning it's much more convenient. I prefer both logical and creative classes\n\n1. **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI would say yes? Personally, I have no real problems with breaking up projects to make them easier to manage, I can also wing it though if i do you should expect not the best results.\n\n1. **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nProfessionally: I\u2019m still trying to figure that out about myself all I know is that I want to be able to build something important, and make enough to support myself and any family I might want in the future.\n\nPersonally: I want to be satisfied, I want to be full of something I want to pursue meaning.\n\n1. **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nFears: purposelessness, emptiness, being unlovable, dying alone, all that fun stuff :)\n\nUncomfortable: confrontation, talking about myself, touching, PDA, \n\nHate: politics, corruption, hookup culture, government, incompetence, lies, inaction, war, ignorance, hedonism, you get the point.\n\nWhy?: I don\u2019t know, it seems as though Hedonism is the common culture of today, Maybe it\u2019s just in the States, but it feels as though I can\u2019t relate to anyone anymore, It all seems like today's culture is driven by some sort of cult of sex, money, and luxury goods you can\u2019t afford. It seems like everything is spoon-fed to us by the corrupt elites at the top, to make our lives miserable enough that you go to indulge in every impulse you have just to make the pain go away. I don\u2019t really know though It\u2019s just easy to get angry when you see the potential for how much better things could be. I just dislike the way things are run in my country and I\u2019d like it to be better lol.\n\n1. **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?** \n\nDefine a High. No seriously  I really can\u2019t recall I\u2019m sure I've had some, it just difficult to remember since I\u2019m going through a stressful moment in my life. I want to say middle school? It was just a better time, I had a good group, I did well in classes, I argued with some kid in the cafeteria about the 2016 election, and it was overall a good time.\n\n1. **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI think it\u2019d look something like this; It's 3 a.m. and I\u2019m contemplating whether or not I\u2019ve made the right choices and stressing about what comes after, thinking about certain responsibilities I have that I wish I could get rid of, thinking about projects that need to be turned in, that kind of stuff.\n\n1. **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nYes, I would describe myself as an active daydreamer, I think I tend to hide it well enough for people to still be convinced that I\u2019m present in any given conversation though. I would say yes and no, I do my best thinking while I\u2019m walking, There have been times when I\u2019ve tripped and almost got hit by cars, however, it\u2019s not that common. \n\n1. **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nIn all honesty, I\u2019d probably start to talk to myself, I\u2019m not crazy, I just like to think out loud. I\u2019d likely think of the same things i always tend to think about, government, politics, philosophy, books, my own stories, themes, ideas, movies, and video games. I just have a strong interest in social studies and liberal arts.\n\n1. **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt takes me a minute, I not allowed to make mistakes. I have to make sure that my head, heart, and my natural abilities are aligned before I make a decision. I hate the feeling of doubt, but yes it may take a few weeks those thoughts nibble at the brain, of how much easier it would be if I went down this other path instead and I hate it. \n\n1. **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nAs a child, I was very emotional and slowly with age I began to grow out of all the crying up until middle school where I began to push them down a little bit and would continue to do so until I realized that I didn\u2019t really feel anymore, and as of lately I\u2019ve been doing better at understanding myself and these repressed emotions that I've been hiding from myself. I feel as though I\u2019m a better person than I used to be.\n\n1. **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes, but not to keep the conversation going but to make the conversation stop. If not for that reason then I agree because I want to hear more of what their brain has to offer and how deep they keep going. I don\u2019t know the reason I just think People are incredible and interesting.\n\n1. **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don\u2019t really break the rules unless I think they\u2019re stupid, then I break them, like if a sack of doughnut holes are about 5 bucks I\u2019m going to put more in there cause that's bullshit. I think authority should be challenged 100% especially if they\u2019re incompetent or detached, I understand why rules exist and understand why some are important but then there\u2019s another bunch of rules on the side that no one really follows and at that point, they\u2019re not rules.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hello, I\u2019ve been trying to find my type for a very long time, thought I might need some help, I\u2019ll be answering some of the questions (might do more if I\u2019m still not sure) from the guidelines.\n\n1.If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n-Probably refreshed, best if I have a book to read or something to research on my phone, although might feel bit lonely if remained in this state for too long (let\u2019s say a month)\n\n2.Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n- No, being the leader gives me the pressure to be perfect. Lot of times in group projects I see how the group can improve or perform better but I don\u2019t voice my opinions much. \n-Again I won\u2019t be a good leader, although others might think I am. \n-My leadership style will be redoing everything. I enjoy doing things myself so won\u2019t ask others to do a lot.\n\n3.What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n-Past: I\u2019d say I have a good long term memory, but I mostly remember my mistakes. I sometimes refer past events to present situations, like \u201cWhat does this remind me of?\u201d? Generally not enjoyable.\n-Present: I often have my head in the clouds, I do try to \u201cinsert\u201d myself into the present but end up tripping or bumping into things.\n-Future: I can\u2019t say I\u2019m future oriented, but I do see myself planning for it. I often think people are too present oriented or unrealistic about the future. I also see the consequences for my actions\n\n4.How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n- I have a hard time saying \u201cNo\u201d because I don't want to be seen as selfish. Sometimes I do like helping others as I want to be liked more than hated, and I like seeing them being successful from my help. Generally a passive helper.\n\n5.What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n-My biggest fears are complete darkness and the feeling of being useless (or seen as useless).\n-Loud noises, crowds and prolonged eye contact make me uncomfortable.\n-I dislike being told what to do because it feels like losing independence. I also dislike being asked too many questions as they drive my mind crazy.\n\n6.Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n-First thoughts would be: Where am I? Why am I here? How do I get out?\n-Afterwards I would start imagine fake scenarios like a ghost entering the room creating a portal for me to leave this room or start thinking about what would happen if I was stuck in it forever.\n\nThat's all, hope someone has an idea of my type (Apologies for any grammar mistakes)", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "First, some backround:\n\nI have recently began to doubt initial thoughts about my type. I considered myself an INFP for the longest time, pretty much since I first began to take MBTI more seriously. I started out with 16personalities which was always extremely confused and couldn't help but switch between INFP and INFJ so I started looking deeper, learned cognitive functions etc. but it hasn't helped me figure out my type. My best guesses would be INFP, INFJ and INTP, INTJ in no particular order. I am still relatively a noob at this, so I can't say that they are accurate but I provide them anyway and will go into more detail about why I have entertained the thought of being all of them at certain points.\n\nThe reasons for my confusion:\n\nI took a multitude of tests, all of which type me as an INFP with two very significant exceptions that typed my as INFJ. Truity (which I know isn't very reliable, so I just passed it over originally) but Sakinorva then also had the same results consistently (I took it multiple times). This basically was what made me begin to have doubts. But then I made other observations in my life (which I will talk about below) that made me begin to doubt whether I'm a thinker. I fear that I may have taken the tests with an unconcious bias and answered in order to \"fool\" the test that I am an INFP because various important people that I admire were INFPs, such as J.R.R Tolkien. Or at the very least a feeler type, because of the same reason.\n\nMy personality traits:\n\nI am very interested in art. Music particularly since it is the only one I am competant in but also other forms of art such as painting, film, literature, poetry etc. I do consider myself an iNtuitive because, except for an edgy phase, I've cared much for symbolism and abstract concepts. I like to ask questions that are extremely theoretical and utterly impractical (ex: If all humans gathered together really closely and jumped, would our collective mass be enough to move the earth?) I also don't consider myself a Sensor since I have no particular affinity with tools, I am clumsy and quite often disoriented. I find theory a lot easier compared to practice and often feel I lack the afformentioned practical capabilities required to make use of theoretical knowledge. I take criticism very personally and emotionally. I have even cried when presented with criticism about me that was personal, and I strive to never allow anyone to critique me. I do this by ensuring that I am harshest to myself in order to meet the standards of the world with more ease. I doubt my self a lot, though I think that is evident, and often compare myself to others. I am very insecure and competitive. I quite frankly despise my urge to compete with others, hate myself for not measuring up etc. I know that those impulses are unsound.  I am mentioning them as think they could help somewhere in the typing but I digress. I was convinsed that I had Ne aux but then again Sakinorva argues for Ni dom so I'd love some clarification on the matter. Furthermore, although it isn't cognitive functions and thus likely irrelevant I still want to mention it: I read that INFJs are more orderly whereas INFPs are spontainious generally. I place great value in traditional values, customs, ideals etc. and the organizations that are as a guide to life from the past. This would point to me being INFJ according to that standard. However, I despise to-do lists, put off doing work with a deadline until the very last days before its end etc. If viewed in isolation, those traits would make me an INFP This is probably cause for much of the confusion as they might seem contradictory.\n\nFeeling vs Thinking\n\nUsually, and the reason I considered myself a feeler for a long time is that I greatly value morals. The same traditional outlook I usually have applies here. And yet I often find myself arguing for the side of \"reason\" and \"logic\" against idealism. I too would love if the world was perfect, there was no corruption, no poverty, no wars, all was in harmony but I understand that such a dream is unattainable and even an aproximation of it requires a lot of individual effort. Then there is my view on reality as being something fundementaly... real. Unchanging; there are certain laws in the universe which cannot be remade and those are the logical, factual things which we observe. \"I feel that...\" is not a valid arguement to me. \"The right thing to do is...\" is however valid to me, and I enjoy moral problems. I can provide emotional support and solutions to problems when I see another is troubled, however I tend to offer the latter more commonly and I appreciate when it is offered to me. I can be viewed as cruel, judging, and cold (most of all, to myself) and I may not like it that way but I have to admit that it is needed in many situations. This might just have to do with the fact that I am a man, and gender does play a part in this, but I am very intereded to see what it means from the perspective of the cognitive functions. What I want to know is: Is this Ti dom and my Fe inferior function makes my feel that I am unnaturally uncaring? Maybe Te inferior backlash against Fi? Is it perhaps that I am an Ni dom as Sakinorva suggests and these are just the auxilary and tertiary functions? This is my largest concern and any insight is greatly valued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStereotypes:\n\nI am neither a hippie nor a rebel so the infp stereotype doesn't work. I do work, I can be extremely productive and I don't have a problem with finding determination to get down and be productive. I only get anxious in stressful situations, time pressure and competition make me uncomfortable and often put myself in bad positions with deadlines (but never fail to meet them!) so the INTP stereotype also doesn't fit me. I am not a \"rationalist\" and no longer concerned only with empirical evidence to prove everything but I still see them as critical to problem solving. I am a christian, but not just for the Rousseau-ian emotional aspect of it and belonging and the traditions but also the rational arguements behind it, such as those made by Descartes and Kant. I doubt the notion that being religious has anything to do with being a thinker or a feeler, more to do with intuition. Thus, the stereotype of INTP's being anti-religion is also not applicable. I believe in biology, physics, mathematics etc. of course, and although I find them rather dull and not to my tastes (I prefer to understand humans by art, history, literature etc.) they are our tools for understanding the world around us, which ought to be understood. I consider this a nuanced opinion which doesn't particularly feel fitting to categorize within any of the stereotypes. (Feelers arguing that something is real because they want it to be real or thinkers arguing that nothing can be real unless proven with data). This section about stereotypes is an \"excuse\" if you will, to present some more information about myself but through the lens of mbti rather than plain real life examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the idea for each type:\n\nINFP: Most tests say so, I believe that I have Ne-Si, I have a strong sense of morality and values etc.\n\nINFJ: Things of INFP apply, but trusted tests say so and I am not that uncomfortable with hierarchy or routine (even though I do not enjoy the latter).\n\nINTP: I commonly support positions that have to do with logically resolving issues. You could say that I am a \"facts don't care about your feelings\" guy, but I personally still care about feelings which is why I am not sure about either INFP or INTP as I see some of myself in both. Still true if Ne-Si guesses are right.\n\nINTJ: If indeed I have lied subconciously to the tests hoping to be a feeler type and the results are INFJ, then the conclusion is that I am an INTJ. If I indeed am Ni dom, it simply switches the auxiliary and tertiary functions so really not too big of a deal.\n\nIn fine, I came here in order to resolve my doubts as to my type once and for all. I have provided some information (if it is insufficient please feel free to ask more things), some of my observations about myself and some thoughts, reasons I doubt test results and my own typing by functions, how I don't fit within the stereotypical view of any category in full. Any and all help in figuring this out is appreciated. Sorry for the long read and thank you for your time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S If the flair is wrong, tell me please. I have never posted here. \n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}

When i arrived at the supermarket,i stared at the ice creams for 1 minute because i was indecisive,eventually i picked one.When i went to pay,the line was huge.I got sweat up for a bit because it was hot,and then an old man approached me and said to go in front of the line because i only had one ice cream,while others had dozens of aliments.So i got a bit sweat up and became a bit anxious,i went in front and then i thanked all of the others for letting me in front of the line with a neutral face in order to seem normal and casual,i never thought that they would let me in front of the line,so that caught me off guard,that is why i had a neutral face,in order for them to not see how i feel.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "When I was a teenager, I used to have this 'frenemy' that would constantly follow me around, eavesdrop on conversations I had in order to reference things I said and bond with me through that, and SMS/call me nonstop during our last year of school together. During that time in my youth, I was an aggressively mentally ill, nihilistic loner (unhealthy enneagram 5 alert), so I initially dismissed his offers at closeness as thinly-veiled attempts to mock me behind my back with his buddies because of his overt fuckboy personality and bourgeois lifestyle/demeanour. I even insulted his intelligence in such a crass manner so much that his responses to my badgering went from passive-aggressive teasing to straight-up impulsive angry jabs at my repulsive attitude and appearance. However, looking back on it now, I can see that all of the things he\u2019s done for me were attempts at comforting me and trying to help me become a part of the group as a result of him being extremely sensitive to the predicaments of my debilitating neurological impairments.\n\nI always thought that he was an obvious ESTP since he mostly thought about materialistic things (golfing, his status in society, appearance) and always enjoyed living in the present moment (partying, being shamelessly kinky/horny) whilst getting frustrated at me for overthinking things instead of taking action. He also would devote a significant amount of our arguments to bluntly criticising how I chose to present myself to others through immensely detailed similes, as though implying that my behaviour was so 'ugly and nasty' that it reminded him of a spooky spider that creeps and crawls underneath one\u2019s desk, and that I\u2019d never succeed in life acting like that. On the other hand, during those arguments, he\u2019d also make these ominous predictions about my future that ended up being eerily accurate to how my life ended up turning out, which I would acknowledge in the back of my head but was too delusional in my image to confront head-on.

{"submission": "i have tried different online tests and every time i do them i get a different result so i genuinely have no idea what i am because i somewhat relate to every type... so pls help based on my answers from the questions in the pinned post, many thanks to anyone reading this personal reflective essay\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\ni am 21, female, i can speak 4 languages (cantonese, english, japanese, mandarin chinese), and i'm now studying in japan.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\ni used to suffer from depression and had antidepressants from 2019\\\\\\~2021, but i'm now completely off meds and am not seeing a therapist (so that means clinically i'm recovered); also got a diagnosis for asd but it's like very borderline so i don't think it matters much\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\ni'm born and raised in hong kong with a brother who is 5 years younger than me, so it's your typical asian parents and education things, and my family isn't religious nor we actively participate in any religious heavy traditions (except the traditional chinese new year etc). my parents had high expectations on my academic performance and wanted me to receive \"better\" education that i was sent to a private school, but my dad passed away when i was 11 that kinda crushed the family for a while but it's a happy family in general. oh and i have moved houses for \\\\\\~8 times my whole life too.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\ni'm still a student but i have worked part time jobs in tutorial centres (that also serve as a childcare centre), now i'm in japan i just work in a sushi shop's kitchen. i have pretty much enjoyed most of them, as i wouldn't have accepted the offers if i didn't like them in the first place.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\ni mean i now live alone and i'm already spending weekends all by myself, so honestly it's quite nothing, it's like breathing air, i don't necessarily feel either lonely or refreshed, it's just... a part of my life now yknow?\n\n\u2022  What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\ni prefer indoor activities and i do not like sports at all, sweating stinks eww, well but if it's sports that can be done indoors i don't really mind them like going to the gym or doing yoga at home, but they aren't really something that i would actively do on a regular basis. i usually just spend my free time watching youtube or anime or just be on my phone/computer, and i can sit in front of a pc all day.\n\n\u2022  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nit really depends if i am interested in that particular topic, if i find myself interested i can go on with discovering that topic for a long time (months or sometimes years). and usually my ideas are stemmed from something existing - so for example i'm watching a video on youtube then i would think how can i create something similar to this but in my style? what even is my style like? so a lot of times i really feel like creating a youtube channel to execute all these ideas but thing is i literally want to do so many things that my channel would probably just be a whole mess of pretty much everything, for example i once bought a microphone cuz i wanted to record covers of my favourite songs (but i never liked how the videos turned out to be, mostly cuz how much i dislike my outlook), and i once bought a camera because i wanted a vlog a trip (but end up breaking it in the middle of the trip), and also i tried uploading english translation of some japanese videos but they took a lot of time and energy to create that i did like 3 and gave up. there was also a phase that i was into online novels then i tried writing my own, but then i ran out of ideas that i literally didn't know how to end my story so i gave up halfway lol \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\ni used to be active in these kind of situations and would fight for every single chance to be a leader, but after actually being one in high school by leading a whole school club, i decided not to touch this position anymore because i realized that how unfitting of a leader i was. however, in a lot of social situations, i just felt like i had to be in this position because no one wants to do, but it's not like i want to be one either. my leadership experience had been criticized as \"demanding\" and \"expecting everyone to follow exactly what i say\", which was true because i got really mad when i expected people to hand in something that they are supposed to do but they did not at all and decided to do other things instead.\n\n\u2022  Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nmaybe yes, i follow instructions pretty well and i think i deliver what people expected me to do most of the time. or sometimes i finish what i was told to do a little too fast that i may appear that i have nothing to do. and yes i like doing diy's, every piece of ikea bought furniture at my home is assembled by me and i handle most of the tech things around my social circle too, from dealing with wires to fixing their pc's.\n\n\u2022  Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\ni don't think any aspect of me can connect to the word artistic at all. i do not understand art nor i have an idea on what an artist thinks via their work. when i encounter \"what does the author really mean by ...\" type of questions in an exam my immediate thought is \"why am i supposed to know? ask the damn author on how they think\". even when i say i enjoy anime i don't really think about how this scene is expressed and what meaning or metaphor does this particular scene have behind it, i'm just here for the overall enjoyment.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\ni feel like someone's past shapes their personality at present, and i personally do not believe in the predictable future (like horoscopes or crystal ball things), and i believe that one's future is on their hands. in other words, i believe that a person shapes their own future. but if you're asking me how i feel about the objective past, present and future... honestly i don't really feel anything? in a macro scale, i very much agree with people saying that history repeats itself, and i don't really feel hopeful for the future as i don't really have much faith in the world we currently live in is going to be a better place.\n\n\u2022  How do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\ni would mostly try to offer help within my range, because i can't really think of a good reason to reject someone. i really hate when i have to turn down a request too because that's pretty much the only time that i feel somewhat important to others. sometimes i feel like i do a little bit too much that i look back i felt like i shouldn't be spending this much time on them, for example my friend was once struggling on which laptop to buy that he came to me for advice, then i typed out a whole google document of laptop comparison and gave him a whole lecture in that document on how to pick cpus etc, and that costed a whole night's sleep.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nvery much yes. i would freak out if something doesn't go in my expected range.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nyes, because of the environment i grew up in, everyone values efficiency and productivity. everyone acts very fast and doesn't have a lot of patience. for me, i am somewhat influenced by this kind of culture that sometimes when sometimes doesn't go efficiently i would ... not exactly freak out? but it certainly doesn't feel good at all. i guess \"worried\" is the closest word i can use to describe this feeling. and this applies to both mine and others' efficiency and productivity. although i am a heavy procrastinator as well, that as i am typing up this post, i actually have my math homework to be completed.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\ni have no idea how to do that. ok maybe when i used to suffer from depression and was suicical i probably did something similar to emotional blackmail to gain people's attention (which turned out to be a failed attempt as well), but i didn't even realize how much i hurt them until very recently. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nwatching anime, because ... idk it has become a habit for years now. it just feels familiar (probably because i know japanese) and a safe escape from reality. also listening to music, mostly japanese and english modern pop/rock music, because... again it feels familiar, and sometimes i relate myself to the lyrics especially in the rock sector. (it's mostly pop punk so yknow a little bit of rebellion things and a little bit of \"IDK WHAT IM DOING WITH MY LIFE\" things)\n\n\u2022  What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?\n\ni prefer learning things where i can get myself involved into it. so probably my physical senses, as they create a better concept in my head by actually experiencing them. unfortunately typical asian education is just asking you to memorize this and that and i have a small brain. and i struggle with morning classes because i just CANNOT stay awake until at like 11am. other than that i think i can learn pretty fast once i get the hang of the new things that i have to learn.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nyes i think i can pretty much break up big goals or projects into small tasks, because i myself need very extremely clear instructions in order to start doing something. but i allow some degree of changes as long as they are well discussed and proved to work better than the current plan. and please let me know when you have to make a change. PLEASE.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nhonestly i have no idea, i feel like my goals or aspirations change every 5 months. i have no idea what i really want to pursue in the future either, i just feel like i need to get a university degree because i have to or i can't find jobs, and i need a job in order to sustain my living or i will live on the streets, and other than that i can't really come up with anything that i really want to do. even if tomorrow is the end of the world, today i would probably just sit at my home and spend the last day of my life as usual. or im probably gonna go to a well receieved ramen shop to have my last bowl of ramen.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\ni mostly fear people? i don't like crowded spaces because i fear people will look at me thinking im some kind of weirdo; i also fear that people will betray me in the next second, i fear that people secretly find me annoying that they actually don't wanna hang out with me, and i fear that i don't meet others' expectation that i would lose what i currently have (for example, my job). i feel uncomfortable in crowded spaces (but public speaking is fine) (i think i have some kind of agrophobia but it's not like it's professionally diagnosed or anything), odd-number groups and/or being the odd one out. i hate people who refuse to listen to others' opinion, know-it-alls, conflicts with other people (but i get into them VERY easily for some reason), and also people who play dumb. so you see it's mostly people related and basically i hate people.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nwhen i got all the attention and compliments when i was a kid. then it just get worse as i grow up. if it means the high moments in my life then i guess i get super energetic and motivated that i can work nonstop without needing to eat or sleep, and also i become extremely talkative that i would even start to talk to myself, that now i have a plushie with me that acts as some kind of imaginary friend so i feel less lonely.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nprobably when i had depression, i felt like all my fears (mentioned above) are true, i felt paranoid that everyone secretly hates me, and it felt like i was screaming into a void. i was actively suicidal as well. if it's not something this low, then i just sometimes lose my motivation in doing everything and just lie on a sofa for the rest of the day mindlessly scrolling on my phone.\n\n\u2022  How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni daydream quite often, but most of the time its being lost in a train of thoughts and lose focus on my surroundings (which counts as daydreaming i guess?), and i think i'm like half aware that i'm daydreaming? it's like i got focused on my thoughts but at the same time i am aware that my focus is on them\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nprobably just lie down and stare at the ceiling for a while, and fall asleep eventually? depends on how long i'm in that room, if after i wake up i still can't go outside of that room then i would start to freak out and/or worry about a lot of things\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nit ranges from 1 second to forever. but once i made a decision i rarely change my mind on it.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\ni'd say they process relatively slower than an average person, for example when something really bad happens to me, my brain is mostly blank as an immediate response, then the emotions would hit like a few hours later or a few days later when everything is calmed down. for example i rarely cry when watching movies, but the emotions would hit at the night before i go to sleep.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nyes, especially if they're talking about something that i don't understand or i'm not interested in. i usually just nod along when people are making a statement even though i'm not fully listening.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nno, i follow the rules as long as they align with my morals. i feel like the authority is not absolute and is always up for challenges and possible changes, but i'm usually not the one to do so. most of the time i just complain privately but i'm too coward to speak against an authority.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "After research I narrowed down my main functions as Fe Ti Ne Si - ISFJ/ESFJ/INTP/ENTP, however I relate to them all. This is my full questionnaire, which of the 4 types do I sound most like?\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\-Probably refreshed, best with a book or phone, might feel a bit lonely staying in this state for too long (maybe a month)\n\nWhat is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\n\\-I trip and bump into things more often than others, not very aware of surroundings. I prefer indoor activities like watching movies or playing games rather than outdoor activities, but taking a walk on cloudy days sounds nice.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\-I consider myself pretty curious, always asking \u201cWhy?\u201d and \u201cHow?\u201d. Usually when I see or hear something new, I do deep research on that topic. Sometimes my mind comes up with ideas of new projects and connections from things I\u2019ve seen, a lot of them cannot be executed.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\-No, it gives me pressure of being perfect. Others may vote for me as leader, but I don\u2019t have much confidence and do not enjoy the job. My leadership style would be redoing everything as I find it hard to understand others\u2019 work.\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n\\-Lot of times no, I think much faster than I move, like speaking. I am the worst with my hands, even if someone shows me how to do something I cannot repeat it, but I like playing musical instruments.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\-I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m good at drawing, I like doodling and creating something new. I\u2019m also good at drawing anime/cartoon characters. I very much appreciate music as a form of art, makes me imagine scenarios.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\-Past: I have good long term visual memory, and I dwell on past mistakes. Sometimes I refer the past to the present, like \u201cWhat does this remind me of\u201d. Generally do not enjoy thinking of the past.\n\n\\-Present: I have lots of thoughts and often have my head in the cloud. Try to focus on the present but fail.\n\n\\-Future: I\u2019m not particularly future oriented, but am planning for it. Often telling others being too present focused. Can see consequences for my actions.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\-I have a hard time saying \u201cno\u201d because I don\u2019t want to upset others and be seen as selfish. If I actively help someone it\u2019s either they are looking too helpless or I want to see them succeed on behalf of me. More of a verbal helper. \n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\-Very much, I hate it when peoples\u2019 words don\u2019t add up (although I do this too as it\u2019s hard to explain my thinking process)\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\-It\u2019s important when I\u2019m in a rush to do something, but generally I prefer doing the right thing even if it takes a long time.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\-Sometimes, to see how things turn out. I do this indirectly like controlling others using words and body gestures that seem normal.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\-I haven\u2019t found a \u201ccomfort hobby\u201d yet, but I do enjoy researching, reading and watching videos about topics I like. I like to be clear about things and want to know more about it.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most?\n\n\\-I\u2019m a visual learner, also learn from self researching. I struggle with loud environments and group brainstorming.\n\nWhy do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\-I can\u2019t focus in loud environments, sometimes I don\u2019t get others\u2019 ideas in group brainstorming. I enjoy classes that involve creativity and can acquire knowledge, also like small competitions in classes.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\-I ain\u2019t bad at improvising but strongly prefer having a plan. I find it a bit hard to break up projects into manageable tasks, I prefer doing things all in one go.\n\nWhat's important to you and why?\n\n\\-Having a unique set of mind is important as I want to prove to others I know better than them.\n\nWhat are your aspirations?\n\n\\-Archiving something that can change the world, like finding cure for illnesses considered untreatable.\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\-I\u2019m scared of darkness and being useless (or seen as useless), also my own imagination. Loud noises, crowds and getting too much attention makes me uncomfortable. I hate being asked too many questions and orders that make no sense.\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I become more passionate about things, I smile and talk more.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I become a lot more quiet. I will see things negatively and may become critical of others and myself.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\-I can\u2019t say I daydream but I am constantly thinking about things. People sometimes tell me to watch out or ask me if I\u2019m fine. However I am very realistic.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\-First thoughts: Where am I? Why am I here? How to get out? \n\n\\-Then I would start imagining creepy things like a ghost trying to haunt me or I may think what would happen if I was stuck in there forever.\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\-I see both pros and cons when making a decision, I tend to make decisions fast but overthink if it really aligns with what I want, sometimes may change it.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\-I don\u2019t express many extreme emotions and I\u2019m good at controlling them. I think people should learn self control too. However I do value my feelings.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\-I sometimes do this with people I don\u2019t know well. However with my close ones, I almost never do that, I don\u2019t like agreeing to something that isn\u2019t right.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n\\-I often find rules that can be improved but I can\u2019t be bothered so I just follow, and afterwards I may tell my close friends my opinion. However I may break the rules if I don\u2019t see myself getting a considerable result in a friendly game.\n\nWhat is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\n\\-An ideal life in my opinion means work harder when young, rest more when old. Allows alone and time when wanted, but also time for discussing matters with close friends. Strict routines not preferred. Allows listening to more music. Have a good hobby. Generally enjoyable to one\u2019s personal standards but also contributes to the society.\n\nDo I sound more like ENTP/INTP/ISFJ/ESFJ?( or another?)", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "i\u2019m just gonna get straight to the point, i\u2019ve been hyperfixating on mbti for the last couple months (still in a moderately healthy way, i\u2019m in college and doing well but all i can think of in my free time is mbti.) i\u2019ve studied the cognitive functions and their definitions and still can\u2019t decide which one i resonate with. although i\u2019m 90% sure i use extroverted sensing (Se) and introverted intuition (Ni).\n\n\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\ni\u2019m 19, female. i\u2019m an student in college pursuing performing arts as i love having the freedom to express my creativity in many different ways. i\u2019m a third culture kid meaning i grew up in a country different from my native one and i struggle a lot with identity. i spend a lot of time in my head a lot thinking about many different things, from mundane events to the abstract. i love learning about random topics that peak my interest and tend to obsess over them. \n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\ni was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety back in 2021, and i suspect i might have c-ptsd due to some traumatic events that happened in my childhood.\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\ni grew up in a religious household and my parents often forced their ideologies onto me which really irritated me (and frankly was one of the root causes of my traumas) anyway i\u2019ve always disliked going to church for that reason but i just ended up going regularly anyways to maintain the peace between me and my parents\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\ni worked part time at a retail store once and hated it because of how repetitive and boring it was. never again.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\nsomewhat of both but loneliness is kind of a constant feeling for me due to my mental health issues lmfao. i\u2019d also feel refreshed because i enjoy spending time on my own and doing things that make me feel productive.  \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\ni like anything performing arts. i like feeling the adrenaline of being on stage and having the freedom to express my creativity and ideas.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\nvery. i love learning about psychology and i would often watch hundreds of videos a week and read multiple articles and research studies done by professionals. when i was younger i loved exploring videos about the unknown, i was interested in space and geology.\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\ni desire to have structure in my life, so if the time calls for me to be a leader, i wouldnt mind taking on the role. i don\u2019t think i\u2019d be the best at it due to my anxiety but with practice and preparation i think i can be decent. my leadership style would be more on the relaxed side since i want my team members to have freedom in what they want to say and to express their opinions without judgement. i welcome an open discussion and constructive criticism as long as it helps with the vision of the project.  \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\ni would say yes. i practice a lot of facial expressions and body movement in the mirror to see which one looks the most natural and \u201cleast awkward\u201d to the human eye. i\u2019ve been doing this for years now so i can safely say my mind and body coordination is pretty well trained. i do enjoy working with my hands and body, since i am a student in a performing arts course, almost every class i have involves some form of physical activity.\n\n(continued in comments)", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hi! So I know I'm definitely a pessimist. Like I could be absolutely certain that nothing will go wrong unless I somehow die while doing something, but what I say to others is still just giving off a pessimistic prediction of what might happen.\n\nSometimes when I'm really happy with a situation, I start worrying about losing this happy place. Either fearing that I'm not good enough to hold my place in this happiness or just worried that something will come and take away the happy place, I start panicking and making efforts to keep the situation there, but usually end up the reason that the situation goes away and I'm unhappy again. Then when I do actually lose it, I turn into this vitriolic being which worsens the already unhappy matter.\n\nWhen I make a decision, I like to go into research on things, from days to a month. Yet when I do make the decision, I might change my mind. I quite like the feeling of doing extensive research so every crack and nook is made aware of.

{"submission": "I cant tell if im an ISFJ or an ESFJ. So please help me decide.\n\nSo I\u2019m 15F. I always view myself as this nostalgic person who really values her life. I really value the present because I know that I\u2019ll be able to make fond memories that I\u2019ll always be able to look back on. I view my life in an organised way id say - I have categorised my life in terms of different phases/stages of growth I\u2019ll be undergoing, such as primary (elementary/middle) school years, secondary (high) school years etc (fyi I\u2019m singaporean). I also love to do yearly reviews, because I love to look back on my growth and all the key moments that make the year unique. I always make it a sort of tradition to do yearly reviews. \n\nI also think that I plan my time in a rather rigid fashion. It\u2019s very hard for me to be flexible. So when a problem arises that forces me to change my plans, I get very frustrated. I also heavily determine the best methods to achieve success by looking at my past experiences (successes and failures). One example is when studying for school exams. I try to innovate when I find myself unable to find a proper study technique and want to figure out what works for me. If it helps me get a good grade, I continue with it. If i flunk a test because of it, I scrap that technique and find a new one (more like I watch study videos for tips haha). \n\nAdditionally, I really value what people say. Like, on a near-personal level. I constantly think about how people think of me, and how my actions could affect other people and their impressions of me. I am quite adept at reading body language of a person, and can tell nitty-gritty details about a person and their feelings (e.g just based on observation I can tell who my friends have a crush on). I also am conflict-averse and prefer to keep the peace with my friends. I am trying my best to not be so conflict averse due to past experience, but\u2026yeah, it\u2019s not something that\u2019ll go away that easily lmao.\n\nI also really try to make sense of the world around me. I need myself to explain why the world is the way it is, and I am not comfortable just accepting something just because it exists. An example is how I need to ponder why I/others don\u2019t like a particular book, and why a particular law/rule has been put into place. \n\nI also overthink. A lot. I jump to conclusions SO fast about people because of my insecurities and because of my own observations. I constantly think about \u201cwhat-if\u201ds about my friends - \u201cwhat if they are annoyed at me because I did _____ the other day?\u201d \u201cWhat if this person prefers person A over me?\u201d. Again my past experiences have made me try to control my imagination, but it\u2019s something that just happens sometimes. I also have a track record of being delusional. I remember I was in a pick me girl phase in middle school and constantly finding \u2018evidences\u2019 that a guy i had a crush on liked me.\n\nYeah.

{"submission": " \u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? \n\n\\- I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD. Or maybe my attention span is really fucked. I cannot sit still unless I am deeply involved in a task and I easily lose interest in things.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\n\\- Grew up in a strongly religious background. Always complied with it but secretly never enjoyed it much. I always was against it but just went along with it. \n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n\\- I currently study medicine at university. It is tough, tougher than anything I've studied so far in my life, but I like it. It is very interesting. The body is quite intricate and quite amazing in the way it works.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\- It would depend on many factors. I would feel lonely though.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n\\- I'm not good at any sports, but I lift and run outside. Otherwise I greatly prefer reading or gaming.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- I don't like being in leadership positions. I actively try to avoid those. That is because I suck at managing people and at planning team jobs. I prefer working by myself. If I were to be a leader however I believe I would be a control freak that is too afraid to be too hard on his subordinates.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\- I am quite not in touch with my past. I never regret anything I do since I cannot change it and my past barely bothers me. I in fact have bad memory and I tend to forget things easily. I would love to have an opinion on the present but I seldom live in it. I usually prefer dwelling inside my head rather than experiencing the present. But whenever I get back to reality I believe I do enjoy my present somewhat or maybe I actively try to escape it. \n\nHowever, if by present the question meant the \"present\" as for everyone right now, I think that the present is quite alright. It is as regular as it has been any other time in history. People are dying right now because of disease or other people as they have always done. I simply just move forward. \n\nThe future is uncertain. I tend to fantasise about the future. Near future and far future. But in general I have a positive outlook of it. I cannot say anything for sure about it.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\- I usually help others because I want to be seen as useful and because I want people to like me. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\- Yes. I do believe I am a fairly logical person, but emotion can sometimes take lead.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\- I want to be more productive and efficient but don't know how. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\- I like reading books and manhwas. I like manhwas because they are easy to read and digest. Easy dopamine injections. I like reading books because because they help me imagine things that I cannot experience or see in real life. I especially prefer books that use concepts that could in fact happen in real life, for example the hard sci-fi genre. But I also enjoy books with good plot and well written characters with stories that remain in the mind for long.\n\nI also like gaming. It is a fun way to waste time. Grinding for objectives, defeating bosses, amazing stories. They are like books, but interactable. Sometimes I create mods for games if I am able to.\n\nI recently started running. I used to lift but because of my situation I cannot lift, so I decided to run. I don't know why I like running. I find it a good way to develop a different type of muscle and to improve my stamina.\n\nI also love listening to music. So much that I have become dependent on it. I believe it has somewhat reduced my ability to think, but I love finding new music to listen to. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\- I believe I am a visual and kinaesthetic learner. (I don't understand what is meant by learning environment). I prefer classes that involve logic. I don't enjoy memorisation but can do with it, while I am okay with creativity and physical classes.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\- I am not very good at strategise I think. I tend to overall highlight certain targets and wing the process. Sometimes I don't hit those targets so the project may end much more differently than planned at the start. \n\nSome other times, when I like the project, I tend to imagine it and then work towards achieving it. Normally by myself, as I struggle to share my vision to others and have them follow it.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n\\- I want to grow up as a person. I have been told I am still immature and I realised that I am still immature, so I want to become a mature person. Professionally I want to be successful and knowledgeable. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\- I am afraid of snakes lmao. I am also scared of going in trouble with the law and have my options in life stolen. I want to be able to do whatever. \n\nI am uncomfortable in highly emotional atmospheres, especially with people I am not close with. I am also uncomfortable with people I do not like and with people that do not like me and with people I do not know, as I am quite awkward socially. \n\nI don't hate anything in particular because everything has a good and a bad side. But there are a couple of things. For example, I don't like whenever people act in certain destructive/obstructive/annoying ways to get what they want. Especially when there could be better ways of achieving them without bothering others. For example, certain types protesters, like the ones that block roads. Sure, I understand where they come from, but the way they go about protesting barely illicits any positive sentiment towards their ideals. Want to stop oil? Ok, but don't stop my car, I'm tired and trying to go home. \n\nI also hate sexual assault in particular actually. I hate it. Despicable. No good reason behind it and just makes the world worse for everyone.\n\nI also strongly dislike people with very strong views on certain topics. They just annoy me a lot. I like to question them and try to piss them off by trying to break their arguments down. Not just with people that I don't agree with, but with people that I agree with sometimes too. Though it's rare, because I don't want to be hated too much.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- No idea. I think it's a state where I am continuously content and when my life is in order. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- When everything is wrong and when there is some kind of huge decision with huge implications behind any path I could take. Basically, when I feel trapped.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\- I want to be attached to reality, but I daydream often. I think about things that obsess me and think about random things that I see. I think my daydreaming is affected by whenever I force myself back to reality for a little. I barely pay attention to what's around me because it bores me quickly. Sometimes I completely forget about my surroundings or just depersonalise and feel like I am in a videogame. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\- I think I would think about how exciting it is to be in such a condition. Then I would think about some random thought and obsess over it. But I would also probably turn crazy soon enough.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\- It takes a long time if I am by myself. I try to wait as much as possible before taking a decision. And when I do and can't go back I just live with it. If I can change my mind and overturn the decision I could but I learned that it would lead to me just changing my mind over and over, so I try to keep my decision as much as possible and limit myself to two changes of mind, though they take a long time regardless as I just weight pros and cons and how others may be impacted. Though funnily enough I sometimes know the answer deep inside, and sometimes I choose not to listen to it and listen to my pros and cons that include what other people instead.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\- I don't know. I am rarely sad but can feel like that deeply even more rarely. I've only cried a few times alone. In my daily life, emotions don't play too much of a role. Maybe frustration and extreme irrational anger rarely. I am normally neutral or content. So I would say that emotions don't play much of a role.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\- Yes. All the time. I go along with what they say and bring up points to support their arguments. But sometimes I cannot stand the bullcrap I let them say  or just feel bold so I speak up and tell them why they are wrong or bring contrasting viewpoints. Normally I just let people speak because I don't want to be hated or disliked. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\n\\- Yes, especially when I know I can get away with it and when it makes sense to break them. I do believe authority should be challenged sometimes. It cannot be denied that some rules and laws are there for a reason and therefore should be challenged. Though I admit I do break rules often, even when I see the reason why they were set in the first place - I usually think it's no big deal and that I can gain from them.\n\nFrom different tests I've done over time, I usually got ENTP, followed by INTP. I also relate to ENFP.\n\nSo what the hell am I? I can't stop coming up with reasons why I am not either and tests aren't accurate. Or maybe I am in denial and know the answer already, but what outside confirmation. Or maybe my knowledge of the functions isn't deep enough. Help me please.\n\nAlso, sorry for long post.

{"submission": "So I recently dived into theory after years of thinking I'm isfp, turned out I didn't know wtf fi is actually about lol, I don't really use it as well as te.   \nNarrowed it down to xstp but that's where I got stuck. I'm honestly trying but I'm probably not introspective enough to understand if I'm ti or se dom, so I decided to hit it from the back and try to pinpoint my inf function. Leaning towards inf ni but would appreciate y'all guys help.   \nSo I'll try to give examples of how my fe and ni work, if something irrelevant comes up in the meantime - sorry, I'm still trying to figure it all out and may mix in things that aren't really connected to these functions. Here goes.   \nFe: I'd say I'm pretty good at the social game, and the fact that I've always been well liked in every group is probably proof enough. I did kind of lack in this department in middle school, noticed that and decided to change it, started observing other people, especially the popular types, and learnt mimicing their actions and mannerisms.   \nI have a broad bank of performative emotions, know when to smile, laugh, what facial expression suits the situation, what to say and how to react, which set of body language to use in order to make a certain impression, which persona to put on to be favoured and liked in a certain group. I learnt all that pretty quickly and was one of the popular girls at HS, got along great with people from my group at uni, was well liked by all of my colleagues at my previous workplace; now I teach teens and they love me too. I never took on leadership roles but was still one of the most high standing and respected members in a group.   \nI really like playing these social games, feeling like I belong, being part of a clique, all that stuff. I feel like an excited kid about to play a new game, it's stimulating for some reason. It does tire me out a bit but I wouldn't call it that stressful.   \nNow that I think about it it kinda sounds like I'm constantly faking it all and am actually dead inside, but not really - I do feel stuff, I do actually like some people, but I'm generally content with liking them in silence, without letting them know about it. But people don't know unless you tell or show them, duh. That was kinda my problem in middle school. My classmates thought I hated them when I actually didn't, I just kinda treated them like npc's and didn't talk to them much lmao. Looking back at myself now I completely understand their frustration, but past me was genuinely surprised and didn't know what was wrong.   \nI have insane loyalty and love for my friends, but sometimes when too much discontent and stress from a relationship pile up, it's like a switch goes off and I start feeling cold and apathetic towards them. I get passive aggressive, instigate conflict to prepare a stage for myself to vent out all of my frustrations with our relationship. I lowkey love conflict, people are most honest when they're angry, fighting lets issues get aired and resolved much quicker compared to a calm and friendly approach.  \nAt times I start projecting my own discontent with people onto them, saying stuff like 'I know y'all actually hate me and secretly think I'm an awful person blahblah', even though I'm aware that it's actually me who harbors animosity here, but I kinda use this strategy as a leeway to let my pals know that they haven't been a good friend lately, treating me worse than they should.   \nNi: that's going to be hard af to write because Ni is so abstract and ephemeral it's insane. I've read tons of info about it and still don't really understand wtf it is. Hoping to at least get a couple of paragraphs out lmao.   \nI don't think about the future, at all. It's very stressful and scary. My mother is all about setting and reaching goals, constantly preaching about how important it is and how results are all that matter. I haven't set a single goal in my life, I don't have an idea of where I'll be in several years, or even a year. I just do stuff and go with the flow, hoping life will take me somewhere nice. It's not that I don't achieve anything, I do, but I'm just always focused on the present moment - I want to take up this hobby, I like doing it, cool, I'm doing it. And suddenly I've been enjoying doing it for so long that I got good at it. Yay! But getting good at it was never a goal in my mind. I just kept doing it because I liked it.   \nI never envision what will be. It's all white fog, even short term like a couple of months. And that's why I never plan ahead in anything. Improvisation has lowkey carried me through life, and pretty successfully might I say.   \nI did try to envision how I or my life will be in the future a couple of times, but it never turned out to be true lol. The visions were either too abstract or simply too hard to achieve. And I never took any steps to reach that imaginary future. Just put together a couple of ideas and called it a day lmao. No wonder nothing came true.   \nBut I do get hunches and gut feelings. At some point I just suddenly know if something is going to happen or be a certain way like right now. I know when I'll get lucky rolling for a new ssr in a gacha game. I know something bad will happen soon (I was once on a train crossing a bridge, felt a weird adrenaline rush like sum dangerous was about to happen, a couple of hours after the bridge collapsed). And vice versa, when things look dire and everyone's scared out of their mind, I'm just there like \ud83d\ude00 because I know everything's going to be fine, and it does turn out fine. It's just some kind of a subconscious short-term psychic ability.   \nAnd one more thing, I read an article about how inf Ni works and it described something I experienced to a t. Last year I was working a horrible secretarial job that was so boring, monotonous and unstimulating that it made me hella depressed. My Se was so unfulfilled that I fell into a mental pit, a crying miserable mess. And that's when I went full on wannabe philosophy guru, constantly thinking about how empty life actually is in the grand scheme of things, how useless and hopeless human existence is, that nothing really mattered, that my life was pointless and the future would be even worse, nothing would get better and I'll suffer forever and ever and ever. And so on. The author of the article I read described it as 'falling into unhealthy Ni' for inf Ni users, and I felt that big time. One of the worst meltdowns I've ever experienced.   \nSo there we have it, I tried to cover as much info about myself concerning fe and ni as possible, if you read all that, thank you haha. If you decide to comment and share your thoughts, I appreciate it :)  \n", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": " ESTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": " For context, I've been typed as an ISTP or INTP and I'm not sure if i am any of them or something else.

Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\- Well it depends. I love spending time alone, but i wanna do stuff while I'm alone, sitting down bores me to death and i feel wasted if i don't do anything on the weekend. I always need to be doing something and i prefer to do it on my own.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n\\- Outdoors for sure, I am good at sports (Netball, swimming and badminton) however, my communication skills with my teammates is pretty bad.

What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\-  I'm very curious, sometimes my curiosity gets to me and i start asking unthoughtful questions. I get a lot of thoughts and try to picture a certain situation and all the possibilities that could answer my curiosity. Usually I'm curious about life, just meaning of certain things that fascinate me. Maybe wonder what's going on in peoples heads and how it all works. I like observing my surroundings for more answers to my questions and sometimes i get those answers i seek for.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- I've done some leadership stuff in the past, but i feel like I'm way too independent. It's hard to rely on others and i tend to explode if someone isn't doing something properly. Sometimes i even take over their jobs if it starts to bother me.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n\\- Maybe my mind is more organized than my surroundings.

If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\- I am quite artistic.

Abstract art isn't really my thing though.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI hate the past and can't deal with it, I'm more focused on what is happening now. I like the future to be unknown and let myself go with the flow of life.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\- Depends on the person. If its someone i don't speak to then i wont help them. But if they're a friend i'll help them out. Sometimes i get a little annoyed because they need help with things than can be easily done but it's not too much of a bad thing.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\- Yes, i live in a household where logic isn't used too often when making decisions and it bothers me when for certain decisions they don't use logic.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\- I like to be productive, i dont like to lie around and do nothing.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\-if we're doing a task then i probably would without noticing.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\- Playing guitar, video games, taking walks in the morning, reading books, drawing, painting, writing, and sports (the ones i stated before). I like these because some are relaxing and some make me think a lot.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\- So subjects i enjoy to begin with are maths, pdhpe and visual arts. I struggle learning in a loud atmosphere or even when learning in groups. I prefer doing things on my own. The practical side of pdhpe and art is what i enjoy most about them. I like maths for the use of reason. Like it's methods and equations and how one equals to another.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\- Improvise for sure- I know i'm able to finish something on time so i just do it last second and quickly too.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n\\- Just live a normal successful life, maybe even answer a few more questions that keep me up at night but other than that just a normal lifestyle.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\- Fights, especially unnecessary ones. I feel uncomfortable with compliments and physical touch. I just don't know how to react to it or how to respond to it.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- I would just be in a good mood for some times, joke around sometimes. But usually i'm just neutral.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- i start putting pressure on myself.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\- i don't day dream often, i used to but its been a year since all the day dreaming stuff. I pay attention to what I'm focusing on only. Sometimes my mind is just blank and i think of nothing for hours.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\- Why i'm here, how i ended up here, maybe think about what is possible to do now.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\- I can be indecisive, especially with big decisions. i try to think of what could happen if i do \"this or that\" and then choose the best outcome. Sometimes my decisions change. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\- I try to think about what i'm feeling. Just try to figure out this feeling before i fully process it in my head. Emotions are important in a way but as i grew older i haven't really been expressing them that often.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\- Nope, i have strong opinions. I dont agree with anyone to make them happy i just say what i believe in. It also keeps the conversations interesting.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\n\\- YES, i have broken so much rules that it's always expected of me to do something crazy or just out of the blue. Well challenging authorities is a big step but it really depends on what rule i'm breaking. If im not doing anything illegal then i'd find it funny to challenge people to keep up with my behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats it for now. If anyone has any questions im glad to answer them. I've been having a hard time figuring my mbti so i'll be glad if someone helps me out.

{"submission": "I went to elementary school with she and her siblings (she has two sisters, both are a bit older.) Her mother is (well, I suppose was) actually a photographer, and I remember that she was actually once in a magazine because of it. Her mother is a housewife, and has been one since the girls were all little. \n\nI remember that I was actually in an engineering (STEM, to be a bit more specific) program with her in elementary school - I would have been in fifth-grade, and she would have been in fourth-grade. Children who were considered to be good at math were \u201cchosen\u201d to be apart of the program. I remember, even years later (though I suppose that my memory isn\u2019t *that* bad) that I did not like this girl. She struck me as being spoiled, and bratty - I recall that her mother was actually once at one of the meetings, and that she seemed to be whining to her mother about something. I remember that she just seemed a bit self-centered, like one of those kids who complains about things a lot (I actually suspect that she was her mother\u2019s favorite child between the three - I think that her mother is an ExFJ, and if you glance through her mom\u2019s old Flickr account, you\u2019ll notice that there are more pictures of this girl than there are her sisters.) I don\u2019t remember her as having been \u201cdumb,\u201d though. She just seemed chatty (didn\u2019t talk to me really directly, or at least I don\u2019t think she did) and like she had a lot of energy. This is actually a video of her from a long time ago if you\u2019d like to know what she was like: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9uf8bBeBY \n\nI remember that she did or does follow the activist account for an organization I had been part of. \n\nI have the impression that she has \u201ccalmed down\u201d a lot over the years - she has ended up going to the same high school as her two older sisters instead of choosing one that her friends would have attended. I have the impression that if I met her now, she wouldn\u2019t be as loud and annoying. She is quite thin, and does not strike me as being particularly likely to have a child (she has not done or said anything on social media that would indicate that she is opposed to the idea of having one, but I just feel as though her second older sister - the one who is the middle child - is more likely to have a baby years down the line than she is.) She bakes sometimes, even though her mom is a housewife, and seemingly learned to when she was in middle school. I remember that when I followed her old Instagram account, there was a picture of her where she looked nervous and was covering her mouth somewhat self consciously (she wore braces at one point so perhaps someone teased her about her teeth.) \n\nShe started going by \u201cLiz\u201d (which is a nickname for her real name, \u201cElizabeth\u201d) instead of \u201cAnne\u201d at some point in either middle school or ninth grade. I remember that this surprised me when I found out about it, since she grew up being called \u201cAnne\u201d (which is really her middle name) and I had just never expected she\u2019d change her preferred name like that.

Would you feel lonely or refreshed?  \\*\\*Very very refreshed. I would love to stay by myself in my room. However, I would not be able to stay without my computer. Ultimately, I would find myself trolling people on discord or on reddit. I might bake as well. \\*\\*\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?  \\*\\*I naturally had interest in insects, plants, and geometric group theory. When I was younger, I really liked to hike, especially to observe different patterns and family groups of plant species.  I play tennis occasionally; I don't mind and quite enjoy chasing runner's high.\\*\\*\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? \\*\\*I am unsure of the extent of my curiosity. I have more conceptual ideas than I can execute usually. For example, while zoning out, I would come up with a proof, but later forget or would be too preoccupied to complete or finalize.\\*\\*\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? \\*\\* In any setting, I am terrible with group work. Either I will be in control of the whole thing or I will be doing it by myself. Literally, there will be an coup d'etat if I was an leader.\\*\\*\n* Are you coordinated?

If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy         \n\\*\\* I am terrible with working with my hands.

Of course, I would weight the pros (personal satisfaction) and cons (lowered social status/broken relationship).\\*\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? \\*\\*Naturally, I am manipulative, but it is moslty used for friendliness. Question: At what extent is it controlling? The person I am trying to manipulate has decided to think that way. It was their decision to respond that way to my input. Haha, jk....\\*\\*\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? \\*\\*When learning new concepts, the first question I ask is \"why\" and \"how.\" Looking up multiple different proofs, and the proofs of the theorem in the proof.  After that phrase of in-depth searching of the concept, I go onto it's applications both theoretical and physical.\\*\\*\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? \\*\\*Start by planning and breaking up tasks, but end up not following them. At the last minute, I wing my projects and improvise as I go.\\*\\*\n* What are your aspirations? \\*\\* I wanted to make a mark in history when I was younger like John Nash.

Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you? \\*\\*I used to be in detention almost daily during my teen years for talking or making kids laugh....I didn't care about rules.

{"submission": "Yes, based on the title, I\u2019m debating between ENTP and ISFJ. I can\u2019t tell at all. I have actually made a post regarding my type under this subreddit (I think some of y\u2019all will know lmao). But let me give a better description to finalise my decision once and for all. I\u2019ll read up more about the functions on my own afterwards too, but now my exams are coming up, so naturally I don\u2019t have the time to read up on everything, and I just want to clear this up before I get too distracted. So pls bear with me \ud83d\ude4f sorry for annoying anyone; I must look really desperate rn :((\n\n1) I am 15F. Singaporean\n\n2) dk if this is relevant - Brought up in a family with parents who are very loving, but very overprotective (I still love them dearly tho, besides I see where they come from when they act that way). \n\n3) Had a struggle finding ways to fit in when I was younger. Through past experience, and by picking up social cues, I learnt how to socialise. Am still social awkward tho to an extent\n\n4) My key traits, I feel, are diligent, nurturing, thoughtful and reflective. I view myself as diligent (tho it may not link to typology, because every type can be diligent ofc) because I never, EVER back down even after a failure. For instance, when I fail a school subject, I\u2019ll feel absolutely horrible, but I am not prone to giving up. I almost always find ways and alternatives to improve. My failures genuinely make me mad, and that anger really motivates me to do better. I am nurturing because 1), people have constantly described me as welcoming, kind, empathetic and caring. And 2), I realise how fast people tend to open up to me. And I am proud to say that I am able to cheer people up real fast. I\u2019d call myself thoughtful because, well, partially because of the way I\u2019m writing this post. But also because I constantly try to think about my mindset, as well as the world around me as a whole. My teacher once told me that she admired how broadly I think and how fast I am able to read between the lines and build connections. I\u2019d say it\u2019s true to a degree. I can analyse the people around me (oftentimes being able to correctly guess my peers\u2019 relationships with others), the world\u2019s different problems as well (? Tho i think I\u2019m getting worse at it lmao) as how people think differently (esp compared to me). I can even vividly remember my mindset when I was a kid. \n\n5) I\u2019m quite nostalgic. I love reminiscing abt my past memories. I even made it a Tradition to review my year annually to celebrate my growth and pick apart what was unique about that year. Very tiring sometimes, but well, it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been doing for a long time. So I\u2019d never back out from a tradition that means so much to me. \n\n6) when I\u2019m listening to others\u2019 problems, while I definitely try my best to make them feel better first, the way I approach their problems is by tackling the issue first before giving them emotional comfort. I try to understand WHY they\u2019re feeling that way to begin with. Then I try to identify their stressors. Then I try my best to think about how they\u2019d feel because of these stressors, esp after knowing how they\u2019re like. THEN I give advice based on my own insight and experience. I never like to be blunt because ik it\u2019ll make them feel worse. But I\u2019ve learnt that being honest while being empathetic is better. I still am prone to sugar-coating facts, though. \n\n7) Time to talk about my flaws. Im very stubborn. Like, REALLY stubborn. I dont Like to change myself unless I feel the need to do so. If someone criticises me, I either ignore them or take it really personally. And another reason why I\u2019m stubborn is because I hate it when someone comments about my schedule or way of living my life. That has happened a lot and I get very annoyed. It\u2019s even worse if that person doesn\u2019t even have a valid reason for saying that. I prefer determining myself if I have to change my habits than have other people tell me what to do. I am also very conflict averse. I hate confronting people, I hate BEING confronted, I hate just seeing a heated argument. I want things to be kept peaceful among people. That has unfortunately led to me having many miscomms with my ex-friends. I am also incapable of making long-term decisions. I guess it\u2019s normal for a 15y/o, but like\u2026it\u2019s concerning for me. An example is when i really wanted to get into a particular school after graduating from secondary school. We had the option to apply early to schools of our choice, so that was what I did. But literally 2 weeks after submitting my application, I was like, \u201cwait. What if this school doesn\u2019t suit me? What if another school suits me?\u201d Andddd I ended up revoking my application. Sooo yeah. Oh, and I\u2019m rather irrational at times. I Jump to conclusions way too fast about my friends due to my insecurities and paranoia. Like \u201cwhat if my best friend prefers friend A over me?\u201d It has also led to a few fallen friendships.\n\n8) when I grow up, I want to live a life that I will thoroughly enjoy. I want to be around my loved ones and friends (or if i get married, my partner ). I want to get into my desired career path (communications/social sciences :D). I want to explore a few jobs in that field, then settle into one I feel is most fruitful. I want to understand everyone and how various forms of media impact others. I just want to live a life I can reminisce about. \n\nOnce again, I sincerely apologise if I annoy anyone here. I might look really desperate rn. The reason why I\u2019m posting this again is because, while I was convinced for a while that I might be an ENTP, it still didn\u2019t really make sense to me how my descriptions in my previous post = Ne. Plus my descriptions were admittedly awful. However with my limited knowledge of functions, there\u2019s still a possibility that I\u2019m an ENTP.

{"submission": "I am an eighteen year old woman. I will note that I am perhaps somewhat shallow deep down inside - I cried (yes, cried\u2026 I have been especially depressed lately, though) because today I realized, even though I\u2019d perhaps started to get my hopes up a bit on Tuesday, that the conventionally attractive guy who I tend to check in on (I even gave him my number on Tuesday just to ensure he could text someone if he needs help) will not be asking me out. I concluded this based in part on his expression when I asked him if he\u2019d like to take a picture of what we did before he came to class (he always comes in late) - it\u2019s hard to explain, but it was really a combination of his body language/expression throughout class (the vibes I was getting) and the fact that he chose to sit behind me even though the seat right next to me was open which led me to conclude that he won\u2019t be asking me out. I figure, even though I\u2019m not positive, that he either suspects or \u201cknows\u201d (I think he\u2019s an ISTP) that I\u2019m attracted to him/have a crush on him, once again just based off vibes - but everything he did today, if I am to analyze his behavior, actually leads me to believe that there is no real attraction on his part/no real plan to ask me out. On Tuesday I was sort-of getting different vibes, but I still believe anyhow that his behavior today means that he won\u2019t be asking me out. \n\nWhen I was walking home (and I walk home everyday from college, in part because I am from a poor family and we really do need to save as much money as we can) I cried a bit because I am someone who has grown up feeling very insecure about my physical appearance (I am a black woman and am perhaps slightly below average facially. I\u2019m conscious of the fact that this has emphasized because of where I live/who I live around.) I remember that I just genuinely felt really bad, because I feel like no one will ever properly want me (I also felt silly because I know deep down inside that I am too busy with both school and my part-time job to really be able to handle having a boyfriend right now. I know that if I do get into another relationship, it will likely fail since I have low self esteem and need to take care of my mental health.) I was thinking about how deep down inside, even though I do think I want to marry and have a child, I am worried that I will never find a man who will stay with me and truly care for me (I actually have a part-time job wherein I work with children.) I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and don\u2019t come from a \u201cgood home.\u201d \n\nMy coworker recently described me as being \u201cdiplomatic,\u201d \u201csweet,\u201d and \u201cgood at communicating.\u201d \n\nThese are my social media accounts (my book review account, and my old Archive of Our Own account - I actually started on fanfiction.net when I was still in elementary school, if you can believe it); https://instagram.com/bookreviewsbynairobi?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== and https://archiveofourown.org/works/41223696 \n\nI do tend to \u201cnotice\u201d physical details, and the like.

{"submission": "When I was a teenager, I used to have this 'frenemy' that would constantly follow me around, eavesdrop on conversations I had in order to reference things I said and bond with me through that, and SMS/call me nonstop during our last year of school together. During that time in my youth, I was an aggressively mentally ill, nihilistic loner (unhealthy enneagram 5 alert), so I initially dismissed his offers at closeness as thinly-veiled attempts to mock me behind my back with his buddies because of his overt fuckboy personality and bourgeois lifestyle/demeanour. I even insulted his intelligence in such a crass manner so much that his responses to my badgering went from passive-aggressive teasing to straight-up impulsive angry jabs at my repulsive attitude and appearance. However, looking back on it now, I can see that all of the things he\u2019s done for me were attempts at comforting me and trying to help me become a part of the group as a result of him being extremely sensitive to the predicaments of my debilitating neurological impairments.\n\nI was considering that his developed Ni could\u2019ve been due to him being an obvious enneagram 3. But I honestly wouldn\u2019t know the difference between ESTP and ENFJ 3s either when I think about it in the context of this guy. All I know is he really wanted to be my friend and would constantly push me to throw parties that everyone in the class would like and playfully tease me about how no one would wanna hang out at the library or at a party with no alcohol, kebab pizza (I was and still am a proud vegetarian), or girls they can bring along. So that\u2019s what made me think Se dom back then.\n\nAnd the more obvious ENFJs in my class just always seemed way more mature and serious than he was, but it was probably due to him having a to 7 fix in his tritype compared the others. He was one of the two fuckboys at my table that would toss my pens in the air and snatch my notebook from me when I was busy studying in order to pay attention to him.\n\nExcept rather than trying to contradict and indoctrinate my worldview with a more cynical perspective, he usually would push and tease me in a much more gentle manner with a soft smile on his face compared to his fellow fuckboys. I did that even more than he did and he loved how straightforward and honest I was, but also desperately wanted me to stop at some point because he felt like I was just shooting myself in the foot and got extremely tired of holding back his own life for that.\n\nI also always thought that he was an obvious ESTP since he mostly thought about materialistic things (golfing, his status in society, appearance) and always enjoyed living in the present moment (partying, being shamelessly kinky/horny) whilst getting frustrated at me for overthinking things instead of taking action. He also would devote a significant amount of our arguments to bluntly criticising how I chose to present myself to others through immensely detailed similes, as though implying that my behaviour was so 'ugly and nasty' that it reminded him of a spooky spider that creeps and crawls underneath one\u2019s desk, and that I\u2019d never succeed in life acting like that. On the other hand, during those arguments, he\u2019d also make these ominous predictions about my future that ended up being eerily accurate to how my life ended up turning out, which I would acknowledge in the back of my head but was too delusional in my image to confront head-on. This makes me consider that his Ni is higher in his function stack than I was initially led to believe, especially when one takes into account that he was 16-19 years old when he had these premonitions about me. \n\nFor further context about these 'premonitions', he often gave me the benefit of the doubt compared to other guys of his typical teenage boy archetype whenever I was overwhelmed and delusional because he figured that I simply suffered from some type of mental disorder, and that\u2019s why I was lashing out or displaying inappropriate behaviour. So as a result, he seemed to spend a lot of time with me, prying into my life to find out what kind of things I liked to seem like less of a threat and deweaponise things with me in general. By the end of year 9, he went on a massive tangent about how everything I was doing was ugly, stupid, and nasty and that people would just treat me like a joke once we went into our first year of high school. So for the first two years of high school, I took his advice and got my act together, but the problem was that I was hanging around with the wrong kinds of people who would romanticise depression and shit, and they often criticised me for seeming pretty normie compared to them, so I eventually fell back to my old habits, and that ended up ruining my life, just like he predicted.\n\nI went back to him at 18 hoping to rekindle our connection, and he was very happy and enthusiastic to do so until he felt like I was going to lead him into a position where he\u2019d feel my therapist. So he expressed things like - \"You\u2019ll never get a job with that mental disorder to bear\" -, but also how he wanted me to know that everything was going to be okay before exiting my life forever.\n\nBut idk, what do you guys think of this?\n\nP.S. \u301c I\u2019m sooo sure he was enneagram 3 and had 378 as his tritype.", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": " ESTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Question: do you believe in friendship between guys and girls?\n\nMy answer: not really.. I mean physically is can exist because if two people decide to not to do something else then it can exist on a superficial level (and only superficial, so without hanging out, opening emotionally, talking for fun..) which in 90% of cases it is dictated by the social positions in which one finds oneself, for example two work colleagues or boss\u2013employee dynamic. (Then to be totally honest if you'd like to fuck a coworker it's always possible but it goes against normal social rules in many cases lol, no one likes that).\nOn the other side on a mental level it cannot exist, there is always (in any case) someone who is attracted to the other person, maybe not everyday, maybe not totally in a conscious way, but even those minutes where you think about the other person in that way then it doesn't count as a real friendship.\nJust by thinking abt it, how weird would it be if a mom says to her family before leaving home: 'I'm hanging out with my male friend, bye byee' I mean she could say at the limit 'coworker' but if she says friend and means exactly 'friend' then the family would be angry asf and me and you would be laughing.\n\nBTW this is only my opinion, if you want to talk about it I'm truly opened to new ideas/opinions.", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": " ESTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Guys can you please help me type myself. I have recently taken tests for various type of personality test among with i got-\nFor MBTI-\nENTJ, ESTJ and ESFJ\nFor enneagram-\nEnneagram 3\n\nEmotions -\nMaybe my perceptions of ESTJ are too different for me to believe i am an ESTJ(i get ESTJ most recently). I always thought i was an ESFJ or let's say an F for a long time since i tend to be very empathetic and i tend to be very emotional. But lately after seeing and reading about personality types I have been more accepting of me being a T and not an F due to me being very rational and i keep my emotions and feelings aside when making decisions (majority of the time).\n\nJudging 'xxxJ' -\nI am pretty sure I am a J because I tend to be very systematic and I would list down all the things I would be doing for the day or even the following week with some future plans for years ahead as well. Also I am a perfectionist, I like things to be kept in place, I might not be as hard working as other perfectionist but most of the time I am. Let's say my house is in a mess and I don't feel like cleaning the whole day, I will still clean before I go to bed because I cannot rest well until and unless I am neat and clean. And yes you could say I am a clean freak. Once I clean, it has to be perfectly clean, I don't do so-so cleanings. (These are stuffs I read online for a j, basically planning and also my friends agree I am too much of a J and could never be a P \ud83d\udc80\n\nSensing 'xSxx' -\nAs for Sensing I'm not quite sure myself. Even though I read lots of meanings for the 'S, sensing' I can never really come to a conclusion as to what it means, if you've already read this far please tell me what sensing is I am at a lost. I did see something that goes like 'learning from past and thinking about really and not what if' I'm not too sure so don't come at me for it. But yes I will say from this meaning that I got. I learn from past experience. If I come across any problems and I have experience a similar situation or anyone I know have experienced a similar situation, I take action from the way I/they did. Let's say, a friend brought some game from an online store and had bad experience with the thing he/she brought, I would consider buying a different one as the one they brought wasn't to their satisfaction. (And so far another trait of mine is I always make an example whenever I explain something. And always the simplest example possible). \nIf I happen to come across a situation I have never heard of or known of, I would first check online if anyone has gone through it, or course I would check different articles and videos for it and decide what I would do but trust me in the process I think of the worst case possible and try and find a result for that. Let's say I had done something bad and I got caught from it, but my parents are not aware of it, I will think of a solution to where my parents have found out about it and they are now scolding me for it, by the end if I am at a very high disadvantage, I will just accept my fate (although I solve these situations without the \"if\"s I thought of)\n\nWords -\nI am very blunt with words. If a person is not nice and is acting very selfish/proud or an egoistic person, I don't mind crushing them. Like literally, I have come across lots of people like this and I have talked to them in such a way they get offended to the max. I am very short tempered but I am a very patient person, internally. I can put up with people for weeks and if something really ticks me off I scold them as hard as I can, I don't filter my words at all. And also I read people easily, their expressions, their choice of words and everything I can see through them, if that's the right word. I feel happy when I can see their offended expression when they triggered me. I don't do this to everyone though. Just to those that are veeeeeeeery annoying. I usually filter my words for people I really like, in fact I am quite the people pleaser, I keep everyone happy and I am not hesitant to do any tasks another person is required to do as long as they need help. But never for lazy people.\n\nI have very short attention span -\nThis does not happen for every situation but does alot when people are talking to me, if it's about business and work related, it haaardly happen, or so far I think it has not happened at all. But when chit chatting, if many people are talking to me(I have quite the amount of friends. As extrovert as I can be I feel happy when I interact with lots of friends), I tend to forget what I was saying or even forget when friends ask me something. \n\nAnd I started a job recently and I am very strict with work, work is work personal matter is personal matter. And also I love cleaning alot but I don't do things very fast but when I do it's extremely clean, I can bet on that. And yes 1 more thing, I hate it when you have a fight with others about a certain stuffs and they bring out their ultimate weapon \"you don't care about me\" shit. Like gurl/dude we're talking about practical stuffs and not your stupid emotions. Speaking from experience. And I recently had a fight with my colleague because he was slacking off on his work and he went \"you never asked about my feelings\" this one is a bit different, he has some family problems and he must have had bad news about it but my point is work is work. I don't judge when he's on the phone during working hours as long as there is no work. But if work is there he could just complete it you know, no need to drag his personal stuffs in workplace. Anddd he's an old dude who have had his own company and is on break due to some problems and I am just a kid who barely have 1 month experience  on the real adult's work. Dude why not get your experience to be seen in his work life!! Anyways I am going off topic.

At the same time i was a little afraid of new people, and I went through some family issues that made me feel insecure, that was the time when I went into videogames and spent around 5 hours a day on them, and I oftentimes tried to include people but they wouldn\u2019t (obviously) keep it going with me.\n\nMiddle School \n\nAfter that, I got into middle school, here, I think it was one of the best times of my life because I discovered and got into music, I started playing piano because a friend of mine like to play piano and we both enjoyed Coldplay songs and I wanted to play piano because he did, but surprisingly music became a recurrent part of my life, in that same years, I formed a band and had my first gig at the graduation ceremony at the same time, I think I met my best friends at the time.\n\nHigh School I\n\nThen I got into high school and first, let\u2019s See A was a better student, academically talking, because I never really like to go to school and I found classes to be boring not to say about homework because I always did procrastinate and preferred to do the stuff I wanted to because it was funnier. All of that resulted added to the fact that started skipping classes school, which made me finish it in five years instead of three, but anyway, when I entered high school for the second time more prepared because I had felt that I had hit rock bottom.\n\nHigh School II\n\nOn that second time, I was at academically other student, especially in online classes, because I found that I was more of a self learning person and at the same time, I dated a girl that was like my canon event because I went through some heavy stuff with her but in the end we broke up. Then pandemic was over and it was time to socialise. It was nice :) I made lots of friends all throughout my school and joined another band, we had three gigs and honestly high school was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had. I mainly focused on relationships and people and everyone knew me haha, it was awesome. Also, i had great grades and was able to finish properly but with a whole lot of doubt on what to study in college.\n\nCollege and Bad Decisions\n\nThen it was time to attend college and well\u2026 I wanted to study music but many people had told me it wasn\u2019t profitable and many stuff in general, I was taking many opinions and in the end I went for Communication, even though I find it very difficult to improvise in social situations and improvising in general is a pain for me, I also have to say that I don\u2019t quite like using apps like TikTok and in media, so right now I am planning to go back and pursue my passion which is music, even though the concept of passion is not very applicable to me because the way people feels passionate is kind of alien to me, there are just things that I like and things that bore me out, and since music is the only thing that has been consistent thorough time.\n\nTyping me.\n\nAnyway, hopefully that\u2019s enough information to type me, in addition to that, I gotta say I wouldn\u2019t consider myself responsible nor decisive, I love my friends and family and I like to do the same things over and over again, they give me familiarity.

{"submission": "Here is my relationship with the past, and with the future: I have a lot of anxiety over/around the future, and tend to worry a lot about what hasn\u2019t happened yet/about things I don\u2019t actually have to focus on yet (for example, I actually volunteered to be one of four people who has their essay for English reviewed by their peers, and I remember that I need to turn mine in by Monday evening and have started writing an outline like we were supposed to, but thinking about how I\u2019m supposed to plan out each and every step kind of stresses me out, even though I\u2019ve written many essays and already have my evidence. I suppose that even now, as an 18yr old, I am somewhat worried about the judgement of my peers. I know that this probably will prove to be helpful, though.) I am quite tired right now, always am. I have sleeping issues, I will admit that I messed up my schedule about three years ago. \n\nI am probably partly cynical because I am depressed, and have experienced trauma. I also have anxiety. I have not done a great job of following up to make a new appointment for therapy/get a new therapist even though I know I probably need to see one again, and will be responsible for that myself now that I\u2019m an adult. \n\nI am definitely someone who tends to reflect on the past a lot. I was actually thinking this morning about a guy who I\u2019d had a crush on in freshman year (an ESTP, actually pretty toxic - I remember he once almost fought this girl in my grade because she tripped him a little on the stairs in senior year,) though I was thinking about how him saying I was a 4/10 had really affected my self esteem, and I had started thinking about it more because yesterday I realized (based off body language, facial expression, and general vibes) that a guy who I have been approaching to check in on in Statistics won\u2019t be asking me out. He is nice looking and most likely older than me. I felt rejected in a sense even though he didn\u2019t directly reject me (I would guess that he suspects I like him, though, even though he never said anything of which would indicate this.) \n\nI really lean toward being pessimistic as opposed to optimistic. I have been somewhat worried that I will be fired from the part time job I am working (I work with two-six year olds, and I started as an intern in July due to my prior involvement with Girls Inc) even though I have received absolutely no indication that this will happen. I was happy today at work, I just don\u2019t feel too great now since I seem to have a cold (it\u2019s started to get colder outside) and since I was having trouble with the lab simulation for Anthropology and had to zoom with my professor (I kinda got the vibe she thought it was silly that I was having so much trouble, even though she didn\u2019t say so, or that I\u2019m dumb.) \n\nThese are two social media accounts of mine (well actually, one of the things I\u2019m linking to is a story I wrote): https://instagram.com/bookreviewsbynairobi?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== and https://archiveofourown.org/works/38427709\n\nI will note that I actually do tend to \u201cnotice\u201d where others are looks wise.

I'll post some details, hoping you can reach a conclusion:\n\n* 16 personality tests: ISTJ -> INTJ -> INTP -> INTP -> INTP -> INTP\n* Michael Coz: INTP 100 points; ENTP 92 points; ENFP 75 points.\n* Me self typing myself when learned about cognitive functions.\n\nMe as a baby\n\n* I cried a lot.\n\nMe as a Kid/Puberty\n\n* Always attached to my Gameboy and Pok\u00e9mon games (sleep with GB in pockets)Wet the bed.\n* Just want to play videogames, watch TV, or play baseball with neighbors?I hide behind my mom when I catch somebody's attention.\n\nMe at School\n\n* More focused on playing baseball with friends or videogames than actual girls dating.\n* So Shy I was unable to tell the girls I liked them.\n* I was so reserved. Some crazy girls did me what they call sexual harassment: they grabbed my buttocks and yelled in class how in love they were with me (which, of course, was more to annoy me than to flirt with me).\n\nMe at College\n\n* Sit at the back of the classroom.Nervous while speaking in front of class.\n* As soon as class finished, I reached home.\n\nMe at Work\n\n* Late arriving (although the schedule is flexible since IT is\n* I love to annoy a small group of people, but in a childishly offensive manner. I want to annoy you a little without offending you.\n* I rebelled once again against my boss (I ignored him) and told his boss I would quit when I finished my duties. His boss sent me a meeting, and I declined, stating that it was not necessary to talk. This latter boss (3 levels above me in EVP level) sent me a meeting and told me he cancelled a meeting to speak with me, so I ended up lowering my anger and accepting the meeting.\n* If I like you, I don't tell you; I annoy you.\n* If I hate you, I treat you very seriously.\n* People just say, Ah, it's just \"my name,\" when I do something they find weird.\n* I hate bosses who abuse those with less power (not fair).I tend not to speak with bosses or VPs, although I find more joy talking with the lowest-level analysts and helping them learn something.\n* I tend to say I would be a bad teacher because I don't have the patience, but people tend to say I'm good at explaining things.\n* I prefer my subordinates to do the talking while I keep analyzing things.\n* I procrastinate a lot.\n* I always crack a joke in the middle of a serious or non-serious topic (it takes me longer to be promoted, though).\n* I get angry at rules or situations where people are closed-minded.\n* I hate politics and find it stupid when people prioritize high-ranking bosses over anyone else.\n* I'm so much requested outside work hours so I prefer to turn off my work phone than accepting the call and tell them to fuck off.\n* I have changed my personal phone number several times. Now nobody from work can call me on that number and I can rest.\n* I cannot see something wrong without my mind trying to find a solution.\n* I don't talk that much. Just burst of time.\n\nMe at home\n\n* I'm the oldest brother, so I try to behave more appropriately.\n\nMe out there alone\n\n* Reversed\n* Don't show my goofiness.\n\nMe out there with close people\n\n* I display my goofiness to friends, whether people watch or not.\n* I enjoy making people embarrassed but despise being embarrassed myself (hypocritical social anxiety).\n\nLove Life\n\n* Sucks\n* I'm kind of not that ugly, but I feel so tired of going out and meeting new women.\n* I'm worried that if I get married, I won't be able to buy my favorite gadgets (I love gadgets).\n* I flirt by doing stupid things like making silly faces at the girl or asking stupid things.\n* I never pick up on women's signs. Women end up telling me they like me, or some friend of hers tells me.\n\nHealth\n\n* I'm on an SSRI for social anxiety for the fourth time. I always quit on my own when symptoms relapse.\n* I'm a little hypochondriac.\n\nMe in general:\n\n* I have compulsive behaviors, which I relieve with emotional shopping and eating. (I'm on a $20k USD bad debt right now.)\n* I'm a perfectionist.\n* I make hasty decisions and keep ruminating about whether other options are better for my OCP type. I doubt myself a lot.\n* I feel terrible fear on rollercoasters.\n* I'm afraid of flying and car speeds.\n* I distract very easily.\n* When people yell at me, it's perfective, and HP gets to 0. Loud noises and crowded places discharge me fast.\n* People don\u2019t always know when I\u2019m joking sarcastically or talking seriously.\n* I have an inner child who likes minions, Pok\u00e9mon, making people laugh with silly behavior, and making SFW, non-sexual, non-derogatory, and non-offensive jokes. I want to annoy you, but not hurt you.I suppress my emotions with fun and jokes and try to divert the topic.\n* I hate anger, sadness, and every strong emotion, and I hate showing them to people.\n* I\u2019m not an organized person.I try to avoid debates or discussions because something inside me wants to say something, but after that, I want out of the discussion because I'm a little anxious or get involved in the heat. I prefer to hear people debating.\n* I have much creativity and intelligence but am too lazy to keep focused or finish something.\n* My brain skips between thoughts on different topics instead of going in sequence. Ex: I'm writing a letter, but before I write the last part, I remember I need to fix a backend service for a colleague. I end up leaving the mail in draft and sending it days later.\n* People laugh when I make a mistake. They find me funny even when I'm not joking.\n* My brain absorbs every problem, even the ones I need to resolve, and I blame myself for the problem. Ex.: Mom is arguing with my brother; I must fix it. I tend not to look at problems, so my mind won't hurry to fix them.I am afraid of making a mistake, and when I do it, I feel ashamed, and it bothers me a lot.I say I don\u2019t care about what others say or think about me, but I do a little.

Part of the exception is IT workers who know how to communicate with people.\n* Social pressure can make me spit ideas, and the good ones need to be filtered.\n* I\u2019m more preoccupied with the future.I can be easily distracted from what I'm doing because my interest has been piqued by something else or because somebody has stopped by to say hi.\n* I have periods when I'm social, fanciful, and impulsive. Those times are usually followed by quite a bit of downtime and quiet introspection.\n* I take things personally.I like to watch or listen to heated discussions, and sometimes I start them. \n* I'm not that into reading books; I'm more visual.\n* I try to read people's faces before trying to softly annoy them.People at work like to include me in interviews because \"I\u2019m good at reading people.\n* \"I hate authority and have had problems with people three levels up in the company where I work. Nothing disrespectful. Just when my emotions can no longer be held. I just exploded in a crazy, sarcastic way.\n* People seem to love me more than I love myself.\n* When I'm at the store I prefer to spend time looking for the thing that asking for help finding it unless I'm in a hurry.\n* I hate to be hurried.\n* I constantly try to improve things even at the expense of spending my money or time. I always said when X it will be perfect and I will settle. That momento never comes so I keep repeating the cycle never resting.\n* I feel curious about people who are reserved, mostly women.\n* I enjoy the behavior of some ENTP fictional characters: the Joker (I like to watch bad people burn like C Levels from my job), Iron Man (quick brainstorming, sense of humor, good but self-absorbed), Jack Sparrow (good disguised as weird),I tend to finish lunch at work and visit another small group of people I know and bother them or make them laugh.\n* I love Gengar and Deadpool making fun of things.\n* I won\u2019t ask for help when needed, but eventually will let my pride lose so minions can work on the boring part :D. Exception at work because I'm a manager.\n* I try to do everything by myself almost always, and subordinates\u2019 complaints about me doing it at work\n* When at home and on weekends, I shut off the social button and close myself in my bubble\n* .I hate super-crowded spaces and loud noises. \n* Thank God for noise-canceling earbuds.I dress like a hippie. Mother hates that. I went to my brother's prom in Crocs, and Mom turned into Karen.\n* When I'm down emotionally, I don\u2019t want people around me.\n* When I\u2019m not social, I don\u2019t want people around me.I second-guess myself a lot on big decisions.I like birds.\n* I'm very pessimistic.I tend to get surprised when I say I can only do 40 and end up doing 100.\n\nGood luck with this!", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

How do you deal with them?\n\ni have a really refined view of the past in a way, if i recall it, its about the moments i had with people i loved, or about a really impressive thing i've done. its pretty much nostalgia, but it does not come that often. i don't know about the present tho, i mean, its here, but i lead with it in a more \u201cwhat can i approach here, right now, that can make a nice scenario for me in a future\u201d, and the future, i think about it in a normal scale, don't if most of the time, but certainly a lot.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)?

How and why do you do that?\n\ni wouldnt say so. if i want something, i ask someone, if its something that makes a lot of sense, i will debate about it and see the best arguments that actually make sense to defend my point.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nguitar, writing; perhaps, reading.

Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\ni break projects in parts. thats why i like working in groups most times, not bc i like groups, but because we can make a good work faster than if i worked alone all the time.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\ni want to study journalism at the university of Buenos Aires, i want to go to Porto Alegre when i'm in my 30s then live in London for some time. all with my spouse and children, of course.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears?

{"submission": "Hi! I know for sure that I'm Si-dom. Honestly the Si-Ne axis is pretty clear in my day-to-day brain activities, but I'm less certain on which judging axis I use more. \n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nIn my 20s, female. Hello, nice to meet you. I enjoy making plans and recording down my daily life. Plans >> taking action and finishing them, though. I tend to be cautious and plan ahead a lot, likely to the point where I don't even realize it. I'm kind of a perfectionist and would try to correct flaws I see. I'm very picky toward who I let in, and I tend to reserve my energy toward those who I \"click\" with (for lack of a better word). Oh, actually, this is funny. I had this conversation with my brother earlier today about whether I get along with people or not. I was like, \"No, I do get along with people. I do.\" And then I realized that I actually don't associate with people much except for necessities unless I take a personal interest in them. Either we click or we don't, there's no forcing it. I only feel truly enthusiastic toward people or things I take interest in. \n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNone, but thank you for asking. \n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI'd say just the usual. I have a strict father and a more caring mother. For any structural influence, I would say that it comes from my environment rather than my family. I liked to be complimented as the student who was well-behaved as a child. I do think that it later manifested as assuming the mindset where if I do something to please another person, they have to do the same for me in a similar situation. I got pointed out that the world doesn't work that way quite a few times over the course of my life, but I still tend to assume so especially if I want to get close to that person. I feel unjustifiably angry when I think that this one person will be different from everyone else in my life, but they prove to not be. \n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nStudying as a student. If anyone asks me whether I like my field, of course I wouldn't like it. I feel like I should appreciate my opportunities since I'm lucky to have this privilege, but I also just couldn't care less. Of course I'd want to do okay enough to not end up homeless, but it's not fun. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nDepends on whether there's anyone or anything that I'm interested in currently. Usually I just drink that quality time up to feel relaxed. I feel like I'm always finding people or things that I take interest in, take a deep dive to get to know everything about that, but retreating once that spark dies or I feel like the passion and wish for intimacy I feel is not returned. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nReading novels, but it's hard to find ones that have everything I like, so this is more of an \"if I don't have anything better to do.\" I sometimes watch C-dramas, but I'm a picky watcher. I like journaling, but just words on a timeline + some comments on each event over the course of the day, no pictures. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI don't think I'm the classic definition of a curious person. Sure, there are things here and there that I'm curious about and search up on Google, but that's it. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nOh hell no. Please excuse my language. I would if I don't trust whoever is in charge, but that's also annoying because then I'd have to prepare to argue and defend my points against that person. Ugh, it's just so exasperating when there are conflicts. One way or the other, I'm going to do something wrong and then get hated for that. Like what if they're the wacko kind and decides to stab me? But if I just let them do whatever, somehow I'm going to be blamed for standing in the wrong place\u2014that's actually not always true, but it might happen. Please please please let people be normal, calm, civilized, sane human beings when we have to work in teams. Anyway, you get the inferior Ne. :P\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nAlso no. I wouldn't trip on my own foot, but I am pretty clumsy with my hands when cleaning, and let's not talk about sports. x\\_x\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nRecently, I've taken up trying to write short stories or novels again. So far still stuck on the outline. I tend to just repeatedly get into this or that art-related stuff only to realize that I'm bad at it. \n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nPast = resource, reminisce, \"oh that reminded me of this thing in the past it doesn't matter but I thought of mentioning it\" moments\n\nPresent = mostly focused on this but not fully there, present but also subjective present, \"let's see when's the nearest deadline\" present\n\nFuture = so the sun will explode some time in the future, oh how scary, oh aliens, nope let's ignore this\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nSometimes I feel like their tone is everything. I would help, but also the \"anything\" part is kinda sketchy. I don't want to get in trouble for helping them with illegal stuff, myself and loved ones >>> others. I'd still help others, but I would only actively help out people within my inner circle. Others are more just \"if they come to me and ask + it's just a 2-second thing.\" \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIdk, any specific examples in real life please? I don't understand what you mean here, I'm sorry. Like I wouldn't go around and be like \"lol your logic sucks lol that's not logical for you to say that,\" but I can realize when people's comments don't really line up with logic in terms of cause and effects. Should I really criticize them of that, though? I feel like I myself am not doing good enough in that department. But then sometimes I can't help but be judgmental for more so radical statements when they don't line up. Uhhh, I don't know, let's move on haha.  \n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nInstructions >>>>>>>>>> efficiency. Just let me follow that instruction on the box dammit. I don't care if it's faster. Just let me follow the instructions. It's safer this way. \n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nPerhaps? It doesn't register as that for me when I do it, but I come off as controlling when I try to care for others. What I consider as care, anyway. Like if I notice a friend or sibling is frustrated at perhaps a food not being as easy to eat as they want, then I assume that I should give them a tissue, cut up the food for them, or suggest that they can eat the food in a certain way. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI think journaling counts as one that stuck to me. Occasionally I take up projects to improve myself, currently on the losing weight one. I think reading up on the Enneagram or generally just trying to define myself more counts too, but it's more of an if I feel like it for passing time thing. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI'm not sure. Still exploring and hoping that it turns out okay. I like to take paper notes more than digital ones. I struggle more with understanding concepts. I remember teachers and parents alike saying that I should understand why I do something for a math problem, but for me, it was always step 1 step 2 step 3 and fake understanding of a concept enough to answer questions correctly. XD I would count that as understanding the concept, just not the textbook definition of understanding that, though. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nOkay? Okay, yeah. I think I do alright in it. I'm used to drawing up a plan for most things. Even for things like going somewhere or grocery shopping, I want to at the very least mentally go through what I have to do. It keeps the calm of the mind. It always shocked me how some people decide what to eat for breakfast right before the breakfast, perhaps they find my way tiring in return? \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally I'd like a stable job with colleagues who are nice people. Personally I want a soulmate sort of relationship, just you and me. I want to live to an old age and be able to lay on my bed in my comfy house with the love of my life, flipping through my journals with records of each day in the past, reminiscing what happened back then. We'd recount in detail our lives. It sounds great, and satisfying to think about. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI'd say the greatest fear is not being able to reach that personal aspiration in the previous question. Then along the path to that anxiety of not being attractive enough, and then not being authentic and real with my flaws to keep that. There's a great fear of the unknown, and I hate being lied to, but I also hate disrupting the peace. I hate people who act so high and mighty and won't stop with their criticisms (I'm actually guilty of being a hypocrite with this statement since I'm pretty judgmental too). \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nSee personal aspirations. But as of currently, I don't think I've ever felt happy in the sense that the word happy is supposed to give, with the height of emotions that I've always associated with feeling happy. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nTo have no support, or no one believes me, no one's on my side sort of thing. Or to have nothing in this world worth loving with everything I have.  \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI don't think I'm very aware of my surroundings. I don't fall on my face, but I don't remember what my surroundings look like. I mainly daydream about what food I want to eat next, or just notice something in my surroundings and then get snapped back to some random moment in the past. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nIf it's a large, white space with no boards to surround me, I would feel quite panicked and scared. If it's an enclosed space that also happens to be pretty dark, where the only sound I hear is my breathing, I actually feel pretty safe. Add other sounds to that, though, I might have a heart attack on the spot. Regardless, please get me out of here unless someone is waiting for me! Please!!\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIndecisive is my middle name. I probably troubleshoot until the deadline to make a decision based on moments in the past. And of course I might just change my mind just to be even safer. XD\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI usually take some time to cry a bit in private, but not so frequent. It's more of a some tears here and there over the course of a few hours, but no unleash the water faucet sort of crying. I'm the kind to have to process my feelings and put it down to words before I can do anything else. Sometimes I feel like it's hard to control negative feelings, and I don't want to burst out, but I do. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nWhen I take an interest in them, then yes. I actually had a friend mention that I sound fake at one point in my life. I really meant it, though. Perhaps I was overstepping with the compliments? With strangers, though, nod and smile, but really I just don't know what to say. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nNope, definitely more on the rule-abiding side. I generally think we should question the authority, but not so much that it becomes so extreme. I personally think that once you start pushing for an extreme to the point when you just stop thinking or questioning information you receive, that spells the doom for you. That being said, I definitely lean more on the following instructions side. XD", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

I believe you can always learn something new. \n\nMy weaknesses would be that I'm not organized person. I don't really have my life all together yet.

{"submission": "I'll just go by what I remember.   \n\\- Back when I was younger, I was quite a happy albeit shy introverted child that was rather risk averse. I was quite oblivious of many things back then and very annoying. I just do shit that amuses me even at the expense of others. Sounds mostly negative but I mean thats what it is right? I spent quite alot of time researching things that I am interested in, enjoyed creating stuff and I thought I was artistic lol. My practical skills went down by the time I became a teenager, but thats a story for another day. Just a brief rundown into the younger me, that is. Last time I didnt care so much about things and I just aimed to enjoy what I want to lol. My social skills back then were severely lacking, and I struggled to make friends lmao for obvious reasons. Caring about how people feel doesnt come naturally to me. \n\n\\- Lets talk about what people say about me. They tend to describe me as a goal oriented person, helpful, diligent, hardworking, inexpressive, calm, cool, no personality, when in reality, I think its more nuanced than that. In my personal life, I am abit more laid back and relaxed possibly making me see myself differently. I think that its true to some extent whatever they are saying because I chose to do it anyways, since I'd want to prove myself worthy in other's eyes and so on. Its something I can do for others but a little harder for me to really apply it in my own life, which is rather ironic I'd say. Idk, but theres this distinction between personal life and school stuff that I tend to overlook really. I mean, I just hide the real me in front of others so thats to be expected anyways, but I wonder if those sides are part of the real me, or they arent. I dont even know what I want, I can be so indecisive when on my own, but I can have like a vision for how I want things to be if I am doing something in service of others. Its a paradox. Some people think I am a good listener, but thats up for debate since I enjoy talking, however I still do enjoy listening to what others say since I want to learn from them as well. People do say I am opinionated which is true. Lastly, some others say that I am kinda mature for my age but I would never assert such a thing since I have low self esteem, but I mean, this only comes out when necessary anyways, like when we talk deep. I do, to some extent, enjoy that but the person has to engage in mutual understanding with me for that to even happen. These things could possibly help you develop a more holistic picture aside from how I might describe myself and help you understand another perspective such that you can factor in what might be true or might not be when trying to grab clues and seeing what may apply and what might not when typing me. \n\n\\- I am quite a nostalgic person, and I attach myself pretty easily to people or things. For people, I want validation and all. I can keep chasing and seeking out the things I am attached to lol, and I do that quite often to stop thinking. I just like to look back at my memories and the good times from time to time because its nice. I mean, the past takes on a little bit of an ethereal quality and I just think its more interesting than the future. The things of the past very generally appeals more to me than those of the future as they seem more abstract? Its weird lol. Its much more interesting. I dont generally show this side of me unless people understand, but I am very attached to the past. \n\n\\- I like to plan because I dont know how things will turn out and I dont want to lose track of important things so I just tend to plan to make sure I know stuff and the general structure/outline of how I'd like things to be. This is especially if I dont want to lose out on an opportunity and so on and so forth. I can improvise when needed, but I hate sudden changes in plans when its not favourable. This is especially how I can be kinda goal oriented in my daily life when it comes to getting the things I want. I hold myself to a high standard and can be a really big perfectionist. If anything, I am heavily critical on myself and can get defensive and stubborn because I somehow want to protect my ego at the same time. Very contradictory if you ask me, but thats what I know. I just hate how I tend to be selfish sometimes when it is convenient for me to just be like that generally. The reason why I am so goal oriented and etc is because I am jealous of others and I am just scared of losing out, but I mean if it gives me drive, might as well relish in it? \n\n\\- My main goal is to just enjoy life, but I tend to never be satisfied with what I have, and thats what I need to learn. Time to expand on my flaws here. Besides the fact that I am so perfectionistic and critical of myself, and it being the reason I can be so stubborn, the other thing is that I can be very confrontational which can be good in some cases but I can be so fixated and I hate this part of me. Ironically I can also be open minded, but its like when things are quite good. I dont like changing myself for others not because I want to maintain my individuality or be unique, but its difficult, tiring, burdensome, and all, for me to do it. I just dont want to do it. I can jump to conclusions very easily and usually this is more on the negative side of things yet can be very indecisive in knowing what I want or what is good for me in a particular context which I did say earlier. Alot of this happens much more when I am stressed but its already like that when I am not, but to a smaller extent. I have shitty self esteem issues too lol. \n\n\\- I am not good at ideation, creating ideas and so on tbh, however, I do enjoy speculating and knowing what the future may hold. Its interesting and provides a sense of closure for me so yea I do that. I tend to be straightforward like this when I just want to make it concise where possible like this because too long, and people wont read already. However, ppl who know me knows I tend to ramble a whole lot. \n\n  \n", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

N/A\n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? I had a tremendous childhood. I grew up in church my whole life and in Christian school. It\u2019s the best thing that ever could have happened to me and I thank God that He directed my parents to do so\n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? I was the Training Director at a CFA. I loveddd my position and what the job detailed. I love teaching people how to do things. I did not like the people I worked with because they just didn\u2019t respect me. I am now a Corporate Training Specialist for a restaurant business that works remotely and I enjoy the fact that I can get all my work done in a span of a few concentrated hours and I have the freedom to be able to travel and just take my laptop with me!\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? Um I\u2019d hate it so much. If feel super ridiculously lonely and try to FaceTime with whoever would answer or if there\u2019s the option to leave to go hang out with someone else I\u2019d TAKE IT. I\u2019d also feel super anxious at every noise that someone was trying to break into my house lol.\n\nWhat is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i? Um, I\u2019ve never really thought about it, but i used to play sports as a kid. I love going to basketball games and I get super into sports when I actually do/want to watch them lol. I also love exploring my area and going to different coffee shops and restaurants.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? Yessss. I\u2019ve had so many ideas and they\u2019d be so detailed that I\u2019d get overwhelmed trying to put them on paper. Sooo many book/play ideas. I just can never figure out how to execute them in the exact way I want so then I give up lol. I just *know* how I want it to look in my head, but I struggle figuring out how to translate it to real life lol.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? I have been in one before and I liked while I was in it, but I\u2019m too laid-back and conflict averse to want to be in the top leadership position. Frankly, I don\u2019t care about my position so long as people treat me with respect and value my opinion(not necessarily agree, but just respect my thoughts, feelings, and opinions lol).\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? I am definitely clumsy. Like, think Mia Thermopolis lol. I like baking/cooking if that counts. I love it because I can pour all my attention into it, especially if I have a lot on my mind. It makes me feel grounded.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. I am a little. Although any \u201cartistic\u201d projects I accidentally turn scientific(i.e. baking) or become an over perfectionist.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them? I try only to remember the past to help me remember the mistakes I made so I don\u2019t make them again. I don\u2019t really think of the past otherwise. I mean I remember good things from my childhood. I think I\u2019m more so focused on the present and the next right thing, but I like to dream of the good things to come. Although there are times when I can get hyperfixated one the past and things I\u2019ve done wrong and that can be tough to escape, but God always helps me and gets me out of those scenarios I put on myself lol.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? I\u2019ll do it if I feel well equipped or am available. I\u2019d help them cause as humans we should try to help one another.\n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life? 100% yes\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you? I try to be efficient in the best way I can, but sometimes I just need to relax(which I don\u2019t think is the direct opposite of being productive tho) because if I work til empty I find I\u2019m not even that productive at that point and start making mistakes.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? I don\u2019t believe so. I wouldn\u2019t ever do it consciously and I don\u2019t think I would do it at all.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them? Reading, singing, playing the guitar, cooking, and baking. I like any activity that I can fully immerse myself in.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? I prefer physical senses when it comes to learning, I don't like memorization at all. Hands on training is my fav and I find it the most efficient.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? I usually will try to plan it, but end up just winging it.\n\nWhat's important to you and why? This may be cheesy to some, but living a life that pleases Christ because in it is fullness of joy, peace, and He is just worthy of it no matter how it benefits me.\n\nWhat are your aspirations? To serve God with everything I have and submit more and more to Him as time goes on. To be the best person i can be. To be better and smarter, and wiser. To give myself more grace. And to just have a good life(which i do!).\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why? I\u2019m afraid of the unknown. Like the ocean FREAKS me out cause like only 5% has been discovered i think? LIKE IS NO ONE ELSE IS WEIRDED OUT BY THAT??? i don\u2019t like when people invaded my space. I hate being ignored and talked down to. I also despiseeee being yelled at, but that seems like it would be a universal experience. It\u2019s like tho, WHO do you think you are to talk to *anyone* like that?????\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like? The best times are the simple ones that I\u2019ve spent with my family and/or friends and Jesus.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like? I used to literally hate everything about myself and I felt like my life was going no where. When I feel like I have no purpose at all I get discouraged. And I feel really low when I will unfortunately get overly angry with members of my family.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? I daydream a lotttt. I will be in the moment when I\u2019m with someone, but when I zone out I\u2019m still kind of aware of my surroundings unless I\u2019m exhausted lol.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? How to GET OUT!\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? I take a while and then I just make a decision cause I just want to decide and get it over with lol. It would depend on the importance and the flexibility of the decision.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? I will never mean to not process my emotions or ignore them because I\u2019ve realized how toxic ignoring my emotions could be.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? Uh, not really. If i don\u2019t agree with you I\u2019m not gonna lie. I\u2019ll just say \u201cagree to disagree\u201d lol.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you? I rarely(if ever) break the rules. They\u2019re there for a reason right?

Intjs are often analytical and incredible problem solvers. But I'm a pretty observant person myself, I'm often told I have a good eye. The difference is that my mind is either running at a crazy speed, making up crazy scenarios, or not thinking at all to the point where I can't get my mind to think clearly. I can never reach a conclusion, but I'm making up all these endless possibilities. I love problem solving, seeking answers, and learning.

I would say that I am a pretty outwardly calm but inwardly insane individual. Just kidding but I tend to overthink a lot inside and on the outside look like I have it all together. I'm pROBABLY a 9w1, 2w1, and 6w5 (don't quote me on that) in no specific order because I have no idea and I switch it everyday. I don't know if that helps lol\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI have anxiety, depression, and PTSD. So it makes me overthink a lot or get stuck in certain situations from the past.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing had no structure at all. I did not have any religious influence, any schedules, etc. I responded to this very poorly. I barely slept, I barely ate, and I definitely did not do my homework. Eventually, as I got older and moved out on my own, I started developing a structure and now I would say my days are fairly structured. I have a general routine that I follow everyday, pretty much wake up around the same time and go to sleep at the same time. And have certain rituals I follow daily but switch up from time to time. I also began exploring various religious possibilities when I got to around middle school, but its hard for me to commit to one. I end up spending a lot of time kinda researching about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it?

I also like that everyone at my work is nice and so we all get along super well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel lonely if I was entirely alone. I do like my alone time, but only to a certain extent. I would consider myself socially ambiverted. I can go maybe a day or two without social interaction, but then I start to feel really bad afterwards and I get these twinges of loneliness lol.

And I am awful at them. The only sport I like is swimming. Does that even count as a sport..? I assume yes. I don't really like physical activity at all and I tend to just sit all day. But I do like walking outside and the occasional yoga. I prefer workout classes to working out at home for sure. So I guess.. outdoor is better?

The main thing I have ideas of are how people should behave, and I think of the way the world could be if people just changed their actions to be a more moral and kind. I am also interested in other peoples ideas. Does it count as an idea if you have ideas of what you could do with your life like the type of person you could be or the type of job you should do for the rest of your life but then change it everyday....? Because thats what I do. I mainly just have ideas on who I could become or the things I could do with my life but just as quickly as they come they are gone. I think my ideas are more environmental because it basically just comes from things I see and then get inspired by. They aren't really abstract concepts but more straightforward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it?

I think it's way too high stress and I'd prefer not to. As a leader, I tend to just do more gentle suggestions than actual commands. Like hey maybe we could do \\_\\_\\_\\_. And I often use the wording of we instead of you to kinda soften the statement. So really it's more of just.. a friend who suggests what you could be doing. I try to be more for the people than the job because the job at the end of the day doesn't matter much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not coordinated at all. I zone off a lot.. I trip a lot.. I try to coordinate my hands and my feet but I get too focused on one aspect that I ignore the other aspect. I do like working with my hands though and think it's super fun. I like to cook.. bake.. craft.. play with stress toys lol. I like hands on activities the most if I'm not spending my time reading Reddit. I just like to do anything to keep myself busy at all times or I get bored and feel like I should be doing something. I like to clean and organize too but sometimes I really don't want to and I have to use all my power to force myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI would say... no. not really. I mean.. I like crafting.. I enjoyed knitting for awhile but fell off of it. I do like art when I actually do it but most of the time I hesitate to start. I love writing poems but I can only write them when I feel sad and lately I've been feeling good so.. no poems lately. I LOVE ART though. I love looking at art and could look at it all day, I love reading poems, I love any artistic medium at all really. I think it is so amazing and it's crazy that somebody could have that skill. I also like how you can feel the artists emotions through their work a lot of the time. Art is just so amazing to me in every aspect. Old art, new art, futuristic art, art of hamsters doing people things, anime art, etc.. everything is beautiful. I also feel inspired by art to sort of craft myself. Like sometimes I will be scrolling and see art of a clown and I'm like.. I WANNA DRESS LIKE A CLOWN AND JOIN THE CIRCUS. So it's very impactful to me and can inspire my new dream of the week lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past has formed who I am and every experience I've lived through has brought me new understanding and peace within myself. I feel that a lot of the time the past has something you can learn from it, and often times what happens to you happens because you needed to learn a lesson from it. The present and the past are my primary modes of living for sure. I think that you have to enjoy the present moment you have, because in a second it could fall out of your hands. Seize the moment however you can, and just try to fill it with things that make you feel happy. The future to be honest I don't really care about. The only thing I even think of about the future is like.. what if my life is different. What if I broke up with my partner or what if we get married. How many kids will we have. Blah blah blah. It's mainly shit like that lol so it's not really something I think about very often. I probably actively try to avoid thinking about the future because I just think it's boring to think about in general. Anything could happen.. whats the point of me even thinking about it. Though when I get anxious sometimes I will think about how my life could go wrong in the future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nAnytime anyone asks for my help, I will help them without question. Sometimes I don't necessarily even want to do it but I feel like it's the right thing to do and also I feel awkward if I say like.. hey... I'm busy right now actually. So I end up pretty much being at everyones beck and call if they ask me for help. But I also do think that it is important to be a good person in your life and to do everything you can to help others. We live such short lives and the lives that we live shouldn't be lived primarily selfishly in my opinion. So that's why I would want to help people.. but of course there is also a selfish side of me that just wants people to like me and wants them to rely on me. So I don't think anyone has entirely pure or entirely selfish intentions to begin with. It's more of a mixed bag and I think as long as you are doing good it shouldn't really matter WHAT your intentions are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nOk like. I would say I live primarily in a mode of focusing on emotions and gut feelings. I tend to just always go with what feels right. But I also do value logical consistency when it comes to like.. idk shit like medical or factual stuff. Like with that stuff you shouldn't play around and say IMMA DO WHAT I WANT and then die of disease. I think that's kinda common sense. So.. yes...? But also selectively so. I want to have facts to back up my opinions and things that I would try to convince people of too, so that's where consistency is important because you can't just tell somebody you are right because you feel you are right. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nUhhh not very important but I do try to get my schoolwork done early so that I don't have to be anxious about it for the next week. It doesn't always work out that way though. I have bursts of energy so I just work when I have those specific bursts.. sometimes it is early.. and other times it is 1 hour before my homework is due unfortunately. But yeah.. productivity isn't important to me really. I always say I'd rather have an enjoyable life and that work isn't everything and doesn't determine my self worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI will say I've had control issues in my life. I have very intense specific ideas of morality and what people should be doing. I don't tend to force them on people that I don't really know all that well, but the people who have been close to me know that I am very strict when it comes to my morals and what I believe people should do and how they should act. I think this is pretty much controlling people.. because if you argue with them everytime you disagree on their morals then they will probably feel like they shouldn't do said thing. And I also have had some times where I've given people ultimatums where I say you can either stop doing this thing or I don't want you in my life essentially. I just don't see a point in having people in my life who disagree with me on things that are extremely important to me. That's why I don't really care about controlling people I don't know, and will mainly just try to keep the peace with them. Because it isn't like I'm going to be their friend anyways lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI like reading Reddit a lot. I spend a lot of time just researching a lot of random subjects. One of those recently has been religion like I maybe said earlier I can't remember if I did or not. I basically will research every aspect of something I possibly can. Like in this example I've been researching paganism, christianity, buddhism, catholicism, gnosticism, etc.. mainly just for funs sake but also because I want to figure out what aligns with what I believe. I tend to get very deep into a topic for awhile and then switch into another and then another and another and eventually go back into those old topics too. I also like to just go outside and go literally ANYWHERE. I will go to the grocery store for fun.. I will go anywhere anyone invites me to go (if it's someone I'm close to and won't get drained by......) I don't know if that is a hobby. I also like just scrolling Pinterest and staring at art for awhile. Or just.. scrolling reels. I don't think thats a hobby either. But that's all I do with my time so take it or leave it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI am a hands on learner. I need to do things myself to get a feel for them, otherwise I forget how to do them. I struggle with those learning environments where they just give you a pamphlet for how to do something. Or training videos especially.. I will forget everything they told me. Auditory learning is definitely the WORST. I like classes involving creativity and physical senses the most. I think it's a lot of fun when classes will give you freedom on how you can do something, but I do like a little structure still. I like to know what exactly I should do when it comes to like structuring an assignment, but apart from that freedom on everything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nAs I've gotten older I've started to break up projects into manageable tasks. When I was younger, I would just wing projects and improvise everything. Now I try to have a little bit of a plan and break it up into tasks so that I don't get too stressed and burn out. I do improvise things like essays though. I just write whatever is on my mind and it ends up writing like 10 pages and then I just rewrite it in a little bit different wording.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI don't really have any professional aspirations. Personally, I just want to pursue love. I want to bring joy wherever I go, and I want to make people happy and comfortable around me. I eventually want a family too. I really like the idea of having a stable family life and teaching my kids to be good and kind people. I want to just do good and bring more good than bad to the people around me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nMy fears are that people are going to betray me or lie to me and that my entire life will be a lie. I need to know that people are truthful and honest, even if it hurts me. I hate dishonesty, I hate immorality, I hate how a lot of people don't consider others feelings, I hate selfishness. I don't think we live on this planet entirely for ourselves. At the end of the day, everything we do impacts other people. I can't stop anybody from living a selfish life where they refuse to think about the implications of their actions, everybody is in control of themselves and nothing I say or do can change who they are. That fact makes me uncomfortable too, that you can't really fix anybody. You have to let them come to it themselves. For me, I try to always think about the people my actions impact. Even if I do not know those people, or I will never meet them. Things like environmental causes. In our lifetime we probably won't suffer from the lack of care, but other people who have not even been born yet will suffer far more. There's always a consequence to every action people take, they just have to weigh them and choose the best path they can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe highs in my life are rare but great. I have a lot of hope for the world, I have a lot of love for everyone around me, I have all these things that I want to do and I don't feel like I can't do them. I want to just be myself, and care for the people around me and teach them that their life is also worth living. I want to inspire people, put words to those great feelings. I don't have any bitterness in these times, I don't think about things I wish I could change about the world or people, I just have understanding for people coming from different walks of life and how they aren't perfect just like me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe lows in my life are very intense. I get very depressive, very isolated, I start to think about how everything around me is a lie. I fall into the trap of thinking that nobody cares about me, and their actions prove it. I want to change the world, I hold intense bitterness because people are not good and they are selfish. It's all I can think about, and it basically consumes me where I start thinking all day long about the immorality of certain actions, which causes me to isolate even further and cut off everybody around me because I find every one of the faults in them. I can also become very aggressive with the people I'm close to and criticizing them for the way they behave or the things I consider bad that they do. Sometimes I try to understand them, but it just falls through when I think \"well I used to do what you did and I got better so why can't you\" and then I get even more bitter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI am often very unattached to reality. I sometimes feel like I am sitting on a little chair in my brain, watching myself interact but it isn't really me, it's just somebody else who is living for me. I also have a hard time noticing things in my environment because I am always thinking, mainly about people. Most of my thoughts are about other people. I daydream a lot, it's not really fantasy daydreams but rather just concepts I've been reading about or again.. my morals and how they relate to the world around me. People always make fun of me because I miss obvious things in my environment, and sometimes I also spend the whole day on autopilot and walk into doors and shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nSurprise surprise.. I think about people, my morals, and the person I strive to be. I am always thinking about how I can become a better person, do better things, be kinder, how I can impact others to become and do better too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI make decisions on a whim regretfully. I don't really think about it at all. I have had problems with changing my major where I change it without even thinking about it when it spurs on in the moment. I quit jobs on a whim based on the intense feelings I have that day. I decide to move or not in like a day of thinking. I do change my mind sometimes, but other times I feel like because I already decided this thing for myself it's over and I shouldn't try to change it again. I have a lot of doubts about the things I do, but generally believe they are for the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI process emotions without any effort at all. I don't even have to think about it, but I still do. I always know exactly what I'm feeling and why I'm feeling it. Emotions are EXTREMELY important to me. Emotions are my biggest strength, without them I'd be nothing. They allow me to have empathy, understand the world around me, understand myself, understand deeper parts of the human psyche, etc. I use them to navigate everything I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes, all the time. I will agree with people just because I don't want to cause conflict or issues. This is mainly with people I don't know really well or those I really value the opinions of, that I will just agree with everything they say and avoid conflict at all costs. Sometimes it hurts me in my heart because I agree with things I don't really agree with and then it makes me want to vomit because I'm not being genuine but at the same time I do it because I am afraid they are going to scream at me if I don't agree with everything they say lol. But yeah, it's mainly with people I'm not close to. Which happens to be most people. With people I am close to, occasionally I will agree with them or just disengage from the conversation to avoid conflict, but other than that I am mostly very honest with my disagreements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nTo be honest I just really don't care about rules but I will try to follow a general structure still. Like.. I'm not going to follow rules I think are stupid or generally not for the best. I just tend to do things my own way, and normally nobody really comments on it but sometimes I've gotten into trouble for it at work. I don't really care either way about challenging authority. Lord knows I'm not gonna be the one to confront authority, even if I think about it in my head. Most of the time though I find that authority just follows what they are told by their higher power (corporate in the case of work) and that it isn't necessarily how they really feel but them following that structure is what got them to be authority to begin with. So I don't really know if it's that big of an issue with them most of the time, but I don't think they always do things with the intention of being the best but rather just doing what they are told. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16m4b5f)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "This is in response to some of the questions in the pinned post.  \n\\- 14 female  \n\\- When I was younger(than I am now) I was always really loud and narcissistic. Then for two years I got really quiet, although I can't recall the exact reason why. But personally for me it's just easier to hide my emotions that way. Since I can't talk as much if I'm experience negative emotions. Then I realized that this was absolutely pointless, so I stopped being unnecessarily quiet.  \n\\- If I had to spend an entire weekend alone, I think I might feel lonely. Mostly because I love my parents. Although I do just spend most of my time in my room rather than going outside and socially interacting with people, and I'm usually pretty content.  \n\\- I like drawing, or generally just being lazy. Sports really aren't for me.  \n\\- I'm not that curious, unless it's a topic I actually care about, and would like to understand further. Even so, I never really dig that deep.   \n\\- I don't think I'd be too bad in a leadership position. All you need to do is give everyone tasks to do right? Excluding the 2 years of me being asocial I usually take the initiative in group settings.  \n\\- I don't believe that I'm very coordinated. I procrastinate a lot, I don't organize my things, I'm lazy, my memory is shit. I do like hands on activities more (in school) since they're more interesting.  \n\\- I am artistic, since it's fun, a good way to kill time, and gives me a sense of accomplishment. Also, it's fun to look back on your old art and see how much you've improved. My art is usually blends of things I find aesthetically pleasing.  \n\\- My opinions on the past, present, and future. The past is an extremely good tool to learn from. Ponder on it for a reasonable amount of time, but don't overthink about things you can't change. The present should be enjoyable, if not, you screwed up somewhere. So ponder on the past. Future. I don't worry about it much at all. It's not something I have control over, and if it was, it'd just be boring to be able to control it.  \n\\- If people request my help I would to the extent that it doesn't negatively effect me too much. I'd except the request, since I don't have anything better to do with my time, so why not give them a hand?  \n\\- I don't need logical consistency in my life. I don't care, as long as life is enjoyable, and will continue to be that way.  \n\\- Efficiency and productivity aren't important to me. I'm lazy.   \n\\- I like to draw, because I want to be able to create things that I'm proud of.  \n\\- I learn better when I actually experience something. That is, if I don't understand the concept right away. I think I'm not as great with problems that require me to think outside the box, takes longer to process since it's not what I'm primarily used to. Also I find that I get tunnel vision a lot.   \n\\- I'm good with strategizing, I just don't do it much, since winging it is usually less work. Only times I actually strategize and plan things out is when I'm extremely stressed, as it gives me a sense of security.  \n\\- I'm assuming that tangible fears like spiders are irrelevant, since it doesn't say that much about my personality. I wouldn't want to lose the ones I love and be surrounded by people I dislike ig.  \n\\- My \"highs\" in life would just be me being content and not worrying about anything.  \n\\- My \"lows\" in life would consist of extreme stress, a lot of work, with no one I can lean on.  \n\\- I actually used to be able to fully immerse myself in fantasy scenarios, I don't do that anymore though. However, often times I still feel like Im more in my head than actually grounded to reality. Not sure how to fully describe, but it's like, I'm not actually paying attention to what's happening around me, and my focus is somewhere else, although I'm not sure where.   \n\\- If I were in a blank empty room with nothing to do and no one to talk to, I'd probably find something to do, unless I'm just physically unable to move. In which I'd spend a bit of time pondering my options, before deciding that I'm actually screwed, and daydreaming about one of those fantasy scenarios I made up, whilst waiting for something to happen.  \n\\- I haven't had to make many important decisions, nor could I think of any. I do make decisions pretty quickly though, although it's difficult to imagine how I'd feel after making those decisions. So often times, I do end up regretting it.  \n\\- I can process my emotions fine. As in I classify them into negative and positive, and if negative I try to find the general cause of it. I used to be extremely obsessed with picking apart all of my negative emotions, and trying to find a name for the exact emotion I was experiencing. But what's the point?  \n\\- Im not a people pleaser so if I'm actually involved in the conversation, and disagree with something, I'll state my opinion, or nod in acknowledgement of the other person's statement. I wouldn't express the fact that I agree with them though.  \n\\- I don't break rules often. Sure challenging authority is often how famous scientists or some shit made revolutionary discoveries, but I'm not interested in being special and making a change. Breaking rules just gives me more things to stress about. Although if it's a minor rule that I find makes no sense, I may break it. Often times I trust the higher ups though, since if something goes wrong I could just blame them.  \nAnyway, I think I'm an isfp. Se is kinda weird though.

{"submission": "\nHe is my older brother. He is presently in rehab for substance use addiction (and was apparently transferred to a different center recently, perhaps due to relapsing.) However, our parents were abusive (my mother was a \u201cgood parent\u201d for a few years, but both still ultimately raised him in an unstable environment and my father threatened to beat him when he was little. It unfortunately makes sense that he has as many issues as he does at present.) He is \u201coff\u201d now himself, though if you have met my father (and my mother too, honestly) this shouldn\u2019t be a shocker (our father is an unintelligent, emotionally abusive alcoholic who I remember did not treat my brother well at all when he was young/in high school.) Our parents are both psychologically unhealthy. I remember that he started abusing drugs in either his second or third year of high school, though strangely enough, I couldn\u2019t really \u201ctell\u201d at the time - I knew that he smoked pot and he did not stop doing so entirely even though he had once gotten into trouble for doing so at school. I don\u2019t remember what specifically happened, I just have a memory of being in elementary school and sitting in the office with he and my mother.) As much as I hate to say it, it\u2019s like he\u2019s psychologically become a little more like my father over the years. He has not just cut my parents off entirely in spite of the fact that both are terrible and my father favored me when we were little (I remember he once pushed me down and kicked me years ago, I think that this was likely a factor - I was technically standing in font of his shoes.) \n\nHe was enrolled in college courses for a bit in 2020 online but ended up going to rehab and dropping them (he would have been taking them very slowly. He dropped one of the classes because they showed an aborted fetus and I guess this bothered him. \n\nI remember that he struggled to get a girlfriend during high school, and once started to tell me about a girl he met at a party a few years back and how he was trying to get back in contact with her (he told me about a year ago.) He apparently did suggest over the phone last year that he \u201chad a girlfriend\u201d in high school, though. I remember that he almost didn\u2019t graduate from high school, though I think that the drug usage and my school\u2019s racism were the greatest factors. \n\nI have realized after rewatching videos from the Youtube channel I had in elementary school that he was likely depressed back then, even though he was a pretty normal kid in middle school who just liked to play video games. I remember that when I was little, I most definitely couldn\u2019t really \u201ctell\u201d that he had any kind of problems, nor could I have predicted that he would turn out the way he has turned out (though I suppose that I was really blind to my family\u2019s dysfunction when I was in elementary school.) \n\n I regard him as being the member of my immediate family who is the most empathetic (though I am definitely dismissing some of his past behavior in suggesting this. I do seem to remember that he wasn\u2019t a \u201cbad\u201d person when he was in elementary and middle school even though our parents don\u2019t have good morals, and I know that he did really love me when I was a baby/toddler - you can tell when you see older photos of us.) He is five years older than me - born in December 1999.) He did well in middle school (was on the honor roll) even though he likely has an undiagnosed learning disability.\n\nI will note that he did not \u201cavoid\u201d our maternal grandfather when grandpa would come to visit even though my grandpa apparently once slapped him for standing in front of the football game when he was little and apologized. I did once get the impression that he regarded our grandpa\u2019s claims that he\u2019d be getting the house they lost back as ridiculous, though, much like my mother did (grandpa never did get the house back. None of us had really believed he would.) \n\nSomething strange about him is that even though he (and I do mean this in the nicest way possible) definitely doesn\u2019t quite sound like he has the strongest grasp of things *now* if you talk to him (it\u2019s really sad, I think it\u2019s once again a combo of the drug usage+also definitely past trauma because a lot of the times I\u2019ve noticed ever since he had that breakdown that when you talk to him he sounds kind of young like the drugs have damaged his mind) I remember that when he first started getting \u201cinto\u201d drugs in high school (well, I remember it as having just been pot) he seemed to sort of \u201cstudy\u201d it (like online) and seemed to have a fair understanding of what different drugs were and that sort of thing? Like when he would have been about fifteen (though it\u2019s been a really long time since then, so I might not be getting the age right.) I also remember that he once corrected me when I mispronounced \u201cperipheral.\u201d These little things lead me to believe that he is not, and was not, \u201cdumb\u201d like our parents and some other people said he was (though I suppose it\u2019s too late for me to try getting that into his mind. I feel bad for saying this, but most of the time, now that he\u2019s abused the drugs for years, he *does* sound to me like he\u2019s not too sharp. But I never used to think of him like that, or rather he didn\u2019t used to sound like this.) \n\nI do remember that he started acting very strangely around about 2019 shortly before having a mental breakdown (when he was in high school and had started smoking pot, he was already acting strangely, but around 2019 I\u2019m talking about like leaving cum around the apartment complex, that sort of thing. My therapist called CPS when I was a freshman because of this.)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16ndiua)", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hello guys, I do know cognitive fonctions and I can relatively type others correctly, but I weirdly can\u2019t with myself. Sometimes, it\u2019s because I am biased by other test results, sometimes because my mood is low or high, sometimes because of my level of energy and etc\u2026 I first thought I was INFP, then ENFP and then I thought I had more extroverted feeling so INFJ. I even thought I was ENTP for a while. I would really appreciate if you guys give me your thoughts on the things about myself I am about to write. :)\n\nSo, I\u2019ll just trow some random things:\n\n\nIt\u2019s an hard exercise, because I can\u2019t say I really know myself. I am pretty much always self conscious in public. I always worry of the things others could think about me, and I wish for them to like me or find me beautiful, even though I find myself stupid for it. Of course, nobody can always appreciate you, and that\u2019s fine. I just have an hard time accepting this. When I\u2019m overwhelmed by it, I try to just come back to center and appreciate being alive and well. I look at nature in awe and suddenly, it\u2019s fine whatever people think about me. They are the main character of their own life, and so am I. I just need to focus on me and my close ones.\n\nI am pretty hard on myself for the work I do. I am never satisfied when it\u2019s me who does it. I work as a graphic designer, and I am always very stressed of the possibility people don\u2019t like the product they paid for. It can really make me overthink.\n\nWhen I have a stressful event that is coming, I tend to overthink it so much and it\u2019s hard to detach myself from it. I analyze what could happen wrong and how people would juge me, for example. The thing is, I don\u2019t know if this is social anxiety or anxiety mixed with extroverted feeling?\n\nI can read if people are feeling off in an instant. The vibe of the group is pretty well palpable to me. However, I prefer working alone, on my own ideas, so that everything goes like the perfect idea I had in mind. I do have unrealistic expectations, mostly about my work and myself. I tend to visualize the perfect results that could happen bit most of the time, it doesn\u2019t go like this and I make mistakes, then change it but sometimes feel really disappointed of what I made.\n\nIf for example, me and a group of friends are talking about choosing a restaurant to eat, I would let other people chose first. It\u2019s important to me that they have a good time, that they are enjoying themselves and that they appreciate me. However, I don\u2019t put others needs first most of the time. I do the things I like even if other people could find it weird, because even if I am pretty scared of the jugement of others, I would never sacrifice my happiness in life for them. Well, I hope not.\n\nI like to be in nature and I like to admire the beauty of life and everything. Music can really transport me somewhere else. That is actually why I love movies and books. I can live another life for a moment and it feels good.\n\nI kinda have a \u201cpattern\u201d for most occasions. The minute I hear a Christmas music and imagine the snow falling outside, I feel Christmas. The moment I smell the Fall coming it\u2019s another world I am in\uff0e\n\nI like to take things slow and rest and play most of the time. I am not someone who cares that much about getting things done. I like living slowly and yes, maybe I am lazy. For me, watching a movie, listening to music or reading a book can never be a waste of time. Having a successful life, to me, is reaching peace and having admire the beauty and the chance you got to exist. I am rereading and i know i am kinda cringy, I\u2019m sorry about that. I just want to be honest.\nEven though I am always pretty worried of the close future, I try not to think too far and see where life goes at the moment\n\nI like to try solving complex problems and having the results after is always so satisfying. I have opinions that are quite unique on the world but that are still shaped by the point of view of others mixed with my values. I do enjoy having debates, especially philosophical ones. I don\u2019t like to admit it but I kind of want to make others think like me sometimes. However, I will never puch too much and if someone looks hurt, I will stop talking.\n\nI can zone out quite easily sometimes.\n\nSo I guess that is pretty it. Sorry if it was cringe again and very long. :)\n\nIf you could take a guess I would be really grateful, thank you in avance! <3", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": " \n\n***\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.***\n\n24, male\n\n***\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?***\n\nanxiety, taking pills for that condition\n\n***\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?***\n\nI grew up in a secular middle-class family in a quiet suburban area, My parents had a divorce when I was in middle school and since then I live with my mother. I would say that the area I lived in caused me to live in some kind of a bubble of safetiness from what I consider the 'outside world' which probably one of the reasons im more anxious regarding new experiences outside my town.\n\n***\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?***\n\ncurrently not working. My previous work was an office-job which I grew tired of it after a month or so because of how dull and boring at was alongside taking time away from my free time at home. I didn't like having to do something which I don't like and how the higher ups pushed me to 'think big' or 'do more than minimum required ' while I also had to do the job of 3 people and all of my coworkers were about 20 years older than me so I just isolated at break time by either working, eating alone or just spending some time outside until it's time to go back. I would like a job that doesn't take away from my free time and if it includes working with people then people who are my age and with similar interests which I can connect and spend time with.\n\n***\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?***\n\nhard to say if i'll feel refreshed since I think im tired almost all the time - but I do prefer my alone time than spending or sharing my physical space with others - it's been a long time since I shared it with my irl friends and while it can feel lonely it's not something I can't deal with or on average prefer to spending it mostly with others. \n\n***\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?***\n\nWhen I was young I used to play football ( soccer for americans ) and I can say I loved it - after I quit playing it's just hard to get back because it's just not fun playing sports if u are not in shape and I don't like the feeling of exhaustion where you barely have any room to breath. I would say that currently I prefer indoor activities like gaming, watching shows or listening to podcasts and interesting youtube essays, music is also great if it sounds nice or im able to create imaginary scenarios or scenes by listening to it ( which I can also do without it ) and I would say that the only outside activities I may like are walking probably ( which I don't really do much ) .\n\n***\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?***\n\nHard to say. Im curious about what initially catches my attention and I find it may be interesting for me to check it out. I would say my curiosities are more aligned with true crime, politics (when im in the mood ) basketball and such. I also like creating shows in my head which may be based on things I like like anime or other kinds of media and then make a plot and characters which might be 'inspired' by it but not exactly the same. I like true crime because of the mystery and the scary elements it brings with it - I also liked creepypastas in the past but no longer listen to many of them because they are made up and fore me it takes the scary element because it's not real.\n\n***\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?***\n\nDefinitely not. I hate responsibility and I would hate being the one who is most responsible who also give orders to others to accomplish and I fear failing and then the entire or most of the blame will be on me and that my incompetence or lack of ability will be shown on stage as like a way of people to mock me. I would say that if I still had to be a leader I would look to see what is going to work. I think the first things we would need to establish are teamwork, chemistry, knowledge of people's strengths and weaknesses and so on. It will be good to have a good and positive environment which will help people feel more comfortable in the work place and will probably also lead to more productivity and happiness. I think that many of the things that could help a project or a business be successful depends on the morale and the chemistry of the workers - so as such I would like to be able to keep it high to reach the needed results. Tho as I said before - I wouldn't want to be a leader and I don't think i'll be a good at it - but if I needed to then this is the way I would go with probably.\n\n***\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?***\n\nI think I am somewhat clumsy. Can't really say much aside from that despite I had some experience with playing guitar and football I still kind of awkward when we talk about physical activities. I feel like that mostly because I remember a lot of times where I just struggled in doing something physical that others didn't struggle with but I guess it's kind of hard for me to elaborate on that.\n\n***\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.***\n\nwell - depends on the art. art as like drawing? no, im terrible at that, but I think im quite good in the musical sense of art tho it's been years since I played guitar or sang. I was on a choir in middle school and I eventually quit it cause it wasn't what I expected and it took time away from my freetime and I hated some of the things I had to go through or learn like music theory. I can appreciate art for what it tries to convey and the messages it might want to send with it - tho im really not someone you'll find in a museoum looking at them.\n\n***\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?***\n\npast - well my only relation with my past is obviously some memories or experiences and things that I might encounter which reminds me of things I've encountered or experienced before. ex: going to a place I used to go to and maybe some memories will come up. How I deal with it? I don't really know - it can make me somewhat depressive in some ways when I get nostalgic. I will also say that I don't have much of an attachment of objects from the past just because they are from the past or have some memory connected to them.\n\npresent - kind of hard to talk about the present amirite? it's just what is happening right now - and the concept of living in the present always kinda of sounded weird to me. I would say that the present is the best time because it's the one I have the most control over - the past already happened and there is nothing I can do about it aside from not let it shape completely who I am and it also has the power to change and shape the way my future would look like. So I guess the present is the time when you are in the strongest and it will be the most healthy way to live because that will eventually decide what your future gonna be like. Now how I actually deal with it? probably by doing nothing which is something I need to improve on cause im just not that action-oriented and im more passive.\n\nfuture - I think some of the things I could say about the future I already said on the present part but I would say the future (or should I say the imaginary view of your future ) is also important so you could know what kind of person you wanna be and what kind of life you wanna live - you need to have that direction so you'll know what to do at the present time to achieve that goal. Now, how I actually deal with it? by just not doing what I said here lmao. while I have my goals they are not that practical or concrete and it just some kind of an ideal life I want to have with myself without knowing a way I could achieve that - and im too lazy to actually put it to work - but it's also something I want to improve.\n\n***\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?***\n\nI guess it depends on who. I think in all cases I'll try to help but my attitude would depend on who is asking it. If it's someone with an authority or power over me I would be much more negative towards them and i'll find it annoying - if it's with random people I don't mind helping tho it obviously depends on what kind of help they want from me and if I can even help them with it.\n\n***\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?***\n\nI guess? what does it actually mean? (if someone can elaborate on it)  I know I don't want logical INCONSISTENCY in my life since it could make stuff much messier and question my reality so I think that some consistency wouldn't hurt here.\n\n***\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?***\n\nIt's not really important to me. It is something I will need to improve since as an adult it is something you have to develop but inside me  I really don't care about being productive - all I care about and want is to live my life doing the things I want to do for fun and care less about a career or social achievements and such. I just wanna have a good time.\n\n***\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?***\n\nNo. I might give advices to friends and such when I see them struggle with something ( like a level in a game and such ) but im definitely not controlling and I kind off being put off by people like that. Just like I said regarding the leadership question - I don't wanna be responsible for other people unless there is really no other option.\n\n***\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?***\n\nGaming, watching movies/shows, create imaginary scenarios or scenes, listening to music, listening/watching podcasts or essays/videos on youtube, reading on forums like reddit and such or twitter,sleeping and reading about MBTI. Why I like them? that's an hard question - but I guess those are the things that I find the most fun in and I get least tired of. For me it's all about whether a certain activity gives me a sense of fun or not - If I feel engaged and interested then it will my hobby. Sometimes I can obsess over something until I get tired of it and find something else to obsess over and sometimes I come back to get the old-new feeling until I ged tired of it again.\n\n***\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?***\n\nHard for me to answer about a specific type of learning style so i'll just talk about the environment - for me the kind of environment which I will struggle with the most is the kind of the typical school environment where u just copy something that is on the board and there is nothing else - my most favorite teachers were the ones who tried to either involve other things that not necessairly related ( like lets say - talking about aliens ) or let us watch movies or shows that might be connected to what we are studying. I think it's less about memorization, logic or the other stuff and more about how engaged and how fun I think the way they teach.\n\n***\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?***\n\nim not the strategizing type. I think I just do what I gotta do? I read the instructions on how the project should be and then do it according to that, and that's if im not getting lazy and not finishing it at all cause it's too boring.\n\n***\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?***\n\nwhat I want in life is pretty simple but also kinda complicated too - my aspiration is to just be happy and live life the way I want to be. I want to live in a quiet and a peaceful place where I can feel safe and out of harm way and also be able to connect with people I find fun to spend time with. I want to be able to do what I love without the restrictions of work culture or the rat race we all need to participate in cause that's what we are told.\n\nI don't really care about any career and anyway it's hard for me to imagine restricting myself to one kind of work which i'll have to do until I die ( well unless it's the type of job which gives me the freedom I want ) but I was never the type to be able to decide or aim on one specific career.\n\n***\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?***\n\nI have many fears - I would say that one of the main ones are people. Im afraid of people and their intentions. Im afraid of the things that can go wrong because of one crazy person or one scam I might fall into because I was careless.\n\nim also afraid of death - it's seems so surreal to me that life will just be over at one point and that I won't exist, won't be able to think or dream - just nothing will happen and it just makes me depressed sometimes thinking about it.\n\nIm afraid of physical experiences and im closed to experiencing new places and such - on vacations im more of an hotel guy than the one who travels around and it's because I see it as an uncomfortable experience which im not used to or just don't find to my liking. I would be pretty stressful being forced into that kind of situation.\n\n***\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?***\n\nIm happy, cheerful, playful and kind of childish. I tease my friends and being a chaotic troll who just likes having fun activities with others. Things seem hopeful and im optimistic about where im at. I can also be quite open to help or advise people who ask me for help regarding stuff and I feel like im some kind of an entertaining machine.\n\n***\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?***\n\nIm closed off, Isolated from others, depressed, too serious to the point I might find the kind of fun and childish which im not part of as annoying and something that needs to stop, I might become some kind of authority who calls out people for what they do, I become more emotionally unstable and paranoid about the intentions of people and what they might feel or think about me and I question it. I feel like there is no hope and that I might not wanna get rid of my sadness or anger.\n\n***\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?***\n\nI think I can daydream pretty often but also most of my activities are tied to the real world so when im preoccupied with them it's hard to be disconnected from reality. I think I do pay attention to what's around me but I think it's also a result of the environment which makes me feel alerted (for many reasons I won't specify here just shitty situation ) so I kinda have to pay attention to what's around me and to look everywhere - tho I have the moments of signing out if im in an environment I feel it's safe but I don't think it's to the point of being completely disconnected.\n\n***\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?***\n\nwhile if it wasn't part of my imagination I would think about what am I doing in such a boring,blank and empty room \ud83d\ude02 but to answer seriously, I think i'll just make up scenarios in my head which will help me pass the time or think about things that happend - or do the logical thing and quit imagining such a boring scenario like being in an empty room.\n\n***\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?***\n\nim quite indecisive even regarding unimportant decisions - I just don't like deciding on things, and it mostly takes someone to push me in order to make a decision. now, that's if I don't have any strong feelings or thought about it - I definitely know what I DON'T wanna do but I also find it hard deciding on something that I might regret later. And coming back to it - I did change my mind A LOT of times regarding a decision I made- either by myself or by the influence of others - it just makes you go 'what if I did that or that' and that is consistent with my life.\n\n***\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?***\n\nemotions probably influenced a lot of my more negative actions and memories. I remember how many times they took over me in the past and how I did things I regret and im still ashamed of them because of how I wasn't able to control them back then. I don't know how to describe the process of my emotions - but I would say that once I start feeling something that bothers me because of something that someone said and such I try to control it and keep it inside and not let it take over. Based on all this information I would say that emotions are quite important in my life because they definitely were a force I needed to deal with and also learning to control them and not let everything people might say to offend me personally and such. There is still more work to be done but I think im quite fine where im at.\n\n***\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?***\n\nnot really, while I don't like arguments cause I can get quite emotional (and it's embarrasing ) I still go into them unwillingly cause I have something to say. Now Im able to control myself much better but if you'll ask my opinion for someone then I will answer it even if it goes against yours. I wouldn't agree on something I just don't agree with just to appease someone - it sounds ridiculous to me and it's also kind of my ego so idk.\n\n***\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?***\n\nnot really, sometimes on school I skipped some classes or gone out of school when wanted us to stay inside ( even if a class was cancelled ) and I also remember one instance of stealing some football cards from someone which I never returned, so you could say it's some kind of rule breaking but I will never do something serious that I think will have great consequences. I would say that I also got used to some rules to the point it might look ridiculous to some people like not crossing the crossroad no matter what if it doesn't show green light.\n\nI think authority should be challenged because they have the power for good or bad so they should be put into place or question when they are wrong or abusing their powers. Just because someone is high in the hierarchy ( which is concept I dislike honestly ) doesn't mean they deserve it or that they are better than others or can't be wrong - and anyway their power should be limited by the people and other forces.\n\nas I said before - I break rules when I think that the consequences aren't too great, justified and could be explainable and seem logical to the normal person.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

I definitely feel like I'm in a great place in my life and moving forward. \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was somewhat religious. My mom is a strong Christian believer whereas my dad is atheist and pretty much \"anti christian.\" (He makes fun of it often) My family dynamic growing up was not perfect but not as bad as some have it. My family however fought constantly growing up. Lots of yelling, screaming, sometimes throwing things on the floor, etc. However I feel like everyone has matured so much and the family is not like it was then. I did have issues with feeling like the black sheep of the family. I was picked on alot by the family which made me develop self esteem issues however it's something I'm working on and have forgiven. \n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI'm currently a CNA. I did it to gain experience before I start nursing. (starting in January yay!) It helped me get through my depression and I feel like I really found my passion in helping people. Before being a CNA I studied music at Berklee college of music. I really enjoyed that but my direction in life changed as I got older and I wanted something more balanced..aka more stability along with the passion. \n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nIf I had to spend an entire weekend by myself I think I might feel relaxed at first but then sad. I live with people right now so I feel like it's hard to imagine that. Even though we don't talk much I can't say what it'd be like being completely alone. I also have a puppy who truly makes me so happy. I would definitely be sad not having him sleep or cuddle next to me. \n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI love to sing and play guitar. I also love binging shows and getting lost in the pointless youtube shorts which go on and on. I like dance but haven't started it yet but haven't had the chance to go to lessons because of how busy I am with working towards my nursing path right now. I tend to enjoy both indoor and outdoor activities. I do still have some social anxiety due to low self esteem so it can be difficult for me to sometimes be outside hanging out and about but I find when I do I'm much happier and generally don't regret it. Staying inside is more comfortable but also less fulfilling/more sad most times.\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI'm definitely a curious person and I have more ideas than I execute. It's something I'm working on. Hence me streamlining my goals into one at the moment which is nursing. My curiosities tend to be about the human mind and why people act the way they do. This probably is why I'm so fascinated by murder documentaries lol. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI don't enjoy taking on leadership positions. I tend to view authority as needing to be stern with others. That's not the person I like to be even though I believe that is a necessary thing. I think I could do it and actually it might be beneficial for me as it would force me to grow. But it wouldn't be comfortable. Most likely would lean towards democratic leadership. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI think I'm somewhat coordinated. I studied piano for a decade which takes a lot of coordination so I'm assuming so. But also I'm extremely clumsy and will trip over my own feet so maybe not? Not sure haha. I definitely enjoy working with my hands. Anything that lets me touch or feel different textures. I love silly putty, playing guitar, etc. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI am musically artistic. In terms of physical art I went to a painting class I bought for my mom. It was nice but mostly instructional which I liked since I didn't know where to begin. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nMy past often haunts me but I'm trying to acknowledge it and move on from it. I'm not quite satisfied with my present as I've not yet achieved my educational goals however my future holds alot of hope for me. I'm hoping that's enough to fuel me towards my end goal. \n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nDepends on the situation. Generally I don't like it. At work I am constantly asked to do miscellanous things by people that are generally lazy to do it themselves. I'll give a scenario. I'm busy with 10 different tasks which internally I'm trying to sort through and time. A nurse whose right by the water station will ask me to bring ice water to room #74. It's extremely frustrating because it makes me think, \"why can't you do this yourself?\" I tend to think what would I do in that person's shoes. I do alot for my work so it irks me when I feel like people are taking advantage of me out of their own laziness. If its my friend who I know really needs something I will generally be happy to help. My eagerness to help is good if I know that they are asking it because they truly need the help. \n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes I do. Logical consistency is allowing me to put everything into action that I want. \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nIts very important. However it's not something that comes easily to me. It's something that I've worked towards. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nDefinitely not. However, I'd say I'm definitely very controlling over myself. For example: what I do in the day, what I eat, etc. I think I'm like this because I'm a perfectionist which is fueled by insecurity most likely. \n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMusic, music, shows, hanging out with friends, etc. I like them because they help me get out into the world and escape those days when I'm having constant swirling thoughts in my head, which is pretty much all the time. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI prefer Spatial-visual learning style. I probably most struggle with purely aural learning style. I think i struggle with aural because I can get distracted or its just hard to visualize it in action which is how I best learn. I prefer classes based on logic, and creativity.  \n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nDefinitely not the best at this. I can get the steps done but it won't look so neat or clean cut like if you put those steps in an excel sheet. I tend to have a general goal and then improvise as I go. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nMy aspirations in life professionally are to become either an NP or CRNA after becoming an RN. Personally speaking I want to eventually be married, have kids, live a happy life with a family. Other stuff is icing on top of the cake but of course would love the vacations too. :p\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI currently have a fear of getting older. It makes me uncomfortable because I feel like I haven't accomplished the things I've wanted to in life yet at this point. Like having kids, or already being an RN, etc. \n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nMe being carefree and living my life to the fullest. \n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nMe being restricted and not pursing the things I want or not being able to achieve those things. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI'm hyperaware of others around me. I have had bad social anxiety before which is better because of work I've done. I think even when I do daydream I'm aware of my surroundings because of this. \n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI think about my relationship and my boyfriend. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nDepends on what it is. Truly can be really short and take forever. If it took forever then it will be hard to change my mind. If it's a short time I took I would be more willing to consider changing my mind depending on the new information. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me awhile to process my emotions because I feel alot. Emotions are very important in my life. However I try not to let them rule my decision making. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes. Sometimes I think it's not worth it to cause a disagreement. It's weighing pros vs cons. I do this at work sometimes when someone is disagreeing with something. I've seen what happens when two \"challengers\" go at it. It tends to just go no where. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't break rules often. I don't think they should be challenged because in the end it would mostly hurt me. However they should do better and know that there are always improvements to be made. ", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

Me telling them what to do upsets them\n\n- I desire to be very fair to everyone, regardless of how close they are to me. I want everyone to get equal opportunities in accordance to the work they have put in\n\n- In social settings,  I am usually quiet and introspective, sometimes getting lost in thought from staring into the distance. However, I do engage conversation if I feel others are not putting as much effort into it.\n\n- When I see people who would considered low on, say, a societal heirarchy, I distance myself from them and it motivates me to do even more so I don\u2019t end up like them. This has been a great motivator so far.\n\n- External validation, from authoritative figures makes me happy\n\n- Whenever I feel bad about not being good at something, I immediately set it as a goal in my head that, in this timeframe, I have to achieve this objective. For example, I may look a little chubby and set an objective that I must achieve it. I feel terrible if I can\u2019t achieve it in time.\n\n- People often tell me I seem serious and angry alot of times, but I find that to be not the case. I am really in a good mood most of the times\n\n- I can be very anxious about not reaching my goals in time. I do tend to procrastinate and regret it later.\n\n- I love taking care of the people around me, not emotionally, but practically. I help them with their life with clear direct actions. I am bad at providing emotional support.\n\n- I can read people really well, I understand the motivations behind their actions and why they do certain things in their own way. It can make me sympathise with the person more and I will offer them help, however if they neglect the help I gave, I can be hard on them.\n\n- I am very socially cut off at times, I neglect my relationships for other impersonal pursuits. This can end up making me lonely.\n\n- I have a very blunt, sarcastic humor that upsets alot of people.\n\n- I am good at \u2018faking\u2019 myself, or lying about myself so others perceive me as a better person.\n\n- I may be classified as a \u2018healthy narcissist\u2019, as I have high self confidence but I care about others too.\n\n- I like when people rely on me for something and I don\u2019t like taking things from them as it makes me feel weak.\n\n- I am spiritual, but not religious\n\n- I am very imaginative at times, envisioning how things could play out in the future. It can make me dreamy and impractical.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about my lifestyle:\n\n\u2022 I drink green tea everyday.\n\n\u2022 I meditate everyday.\n\n\u2022 I exercise 6 days a week.\n\n\u2022 My room can be very messy at times.\n\n\nMy personal philosophy:\n\n\nI believe the best course of action in life is to do what will benefit you and the people around you the most. Everything we do, it is a choice that we choose to make, even if we do nothing about our problems, it is still a choice that we consciously made.\n\nI believe in every tough situation, we have the capability to overcome it with enough time and effort. The limits of the human spirit can be frightening. Every human has the capability to make the most out of at-least one aspect of their life.\nThis world has been systemized in a way that only the strong come on out on top, and whether you like it or not, this is reality and you must accept and embrace it, unless you are happy in a low position in life.\n\nThere is nothing truly impossible, unless it contradicts the laws of physics. We must set unrealistic and grand goals to get it done.\nWe would have never gone to the moon in 1969, if NASA scientists believed it to be impossible. You must see your goal as the moon as such. Give it your all no matter how many mistakes you make, how much time it takes, you are guaranteed to reach it if you never give up. And I believe, at some 80% of our own life, which is purely personal and dictated by our mind, is in our control. By truly mastering yourself, you master the world. \n\nAfter having dealt with trauma and depression myself, I have realized the ultimate goal of life is to maximise positivity and minimise negativity, for others an for yourself. Whether it\u2019s by pursuing goals, spending time with the people you love, or simply doing your own thing; you must push yourself to be truly content in life.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16obxhc)", "clean_guess": "ESTJ", "llm_guess": " ESTJ", "logprobs": []}

I'm an atheist and a left-leaning centrist.\n\nb) Which types are you currently considering? Why are you considering them and why haven't you decided on one?\n\n> ESFJ, ISFJ, and ENFJ. I've been considering them since those are my results in two tests I've taken (typologycentral and mistype investigator). I haven't decided on one yet since tests aren't really accurate.\n\n2) What do you deem as your purpose in life?\n\n> Meeting people and making relationships with them and taking care of my boyfriend.\n\n3) Of the seven deadly sins, which one(s) do you relate to the most and the least and why?\n\n> I relate the most to wrath, since I usually get angry when under stress, I do try to repress this, however, so I don't affect anyone.\n\n4) Analyzing your relationships with others, briefly describe:\na) The type of people you are drawn to\n\n> I'm usually drawn to people who have the same skills as mine, like in mathematics, so we can get along better.\n\nb) The type of people who are drawn to you\n\n> People who want to make friendships are usually drawn to me, maybe because I'm nice to others and like to have fun.\n\nc) The type of people you are repulsed by\n\n> I'm repulsed by people who are mean because they don't care about others' feelings. I'm also repulsed by people who blame their problems on other people rather than solving or accepting it.\n\n5)What are the traits in others that you admire but you cannot emulate yourself? Elaborate.\n\n> Creativity, since I don't have the ability to create ideas on my own. I admire the trait since it seems fun to be able to create your own ideas.\n\n6) Describe your relationship with the following:\na) Anger\n\n> I used to get angry a lot when someone doesn't empathize or a problem is hard to solve.

A struggle you've been unable to conquer, ect)?\n\n> A theme that played a prominent role in my life is understanding others. I used to have a hard time understanding and empathizing with people, especially my boyfriend. Because of this, when I get angry, I hurt others' emotions.

Because of that, I started empathizing with people more.\n\n8) b) What do you plan on studying/working as in the future? How did you go about deciding this? If this is not your ideal area of pursuit, what would be? \n\n> I plan to become an engineer, an Electrical Engineer to be specific. I decided this since I think it's cool to be able to create different engineered items and the fun ideas I would be able to think of.\n\n9) When meeting a new person, what do you tend to focus on?\n\n> I tend to focus on the similarities so we can get along better. I also focus on how fun they are since I'm not a big fan of boring people who would drain me instead.\n\n10) How do you feel about humanity as a whole? What do you feel are some of the biggest problems the human race faces and why?\n\n> I believe there is still hope for humanity and time for them to develop. Like during the 1900s, LGBT people are less accepted and now, they are more accepted so I do think there's hope for them to understand more issues as long as we give them time.\n\nThe biggest problem the human race faces is ignorance. I see so many people being ignorant about minorities, climate change, etc. Because of these, these problems become hard to solve.\n\n11) What are some of your hobbies and interests?\n\n> I like sports a lot, especially swimming because it energizes me a lot and I like moving around.\n\nI also like fashion and personal care (like skincare) since I like looking good, not to impress others though, I just like myself looking aesthetically pleasing and well-groomed.\n\n13) How do you usually hang out with your friend(s)?

Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?  \n\\> Yes, considering I move a lot and like feeling the environment.

What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?  \n\\> The past is in the past, so it's better to just move on and learn from them. The future can't be predicted and can only be decided based on your decisions. I try to stay in the present moment so I don't worry too much.  \n12. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?  \n\\> I would help them, of course. Some people have skills and flaws or don't know how to do something, so helping others learn is better.  \n13. Do you need logical consistency in your life?  \n\\> I think so. I do try not to be contradictory since I want to also make sense. It's not my top priority but I feel like I unconsciously do it.  \n14. How important is efficiency and productivity to you?  \n\\> It's good to have, but not that important for me. I like being productive whenever I feel like to.  \n15. Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?  \n\\> No, I never try to control others since I want people to be free to do whatever they want.  \n16. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?  \n\\> I like sports, fashion, and gaming. I like sports because I like moving and I get energized because of the physical stimuli.

What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?  \n\\> I usually learn more by writing, since I internalize the information better when I write them.

What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?  \n\\> I fear losing my love ones since I care a lot about them, I feel like nothing without them. I feel uncomfortable when my freedom is taken away and I'm forced to do something because it feels unnatural not being able to do my own thing. I hate negativity since it usually stresses me out.  \n22. What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?  \n\\> The \"highs\" in my life are the positive events that happen in my life, like scoring on my test, spending time with my boyfriend, etc.  \n23. What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?  \n\\> Basically the negative events that happen in my life, like having an argument with someone, failing an exam, etc.  \n24. How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?  \n\\> I'm really attached to reality and I don't daydream much, I only focus on the present moment.  \n25. Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?  \n\\> I would think about how lonely and boring it feels in the room. I'll think about getting out of the room as much as possible.  \n26. How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?  \n\\> I only takes a while for me to make a decision.

What is the ideal life, in your opinion?  \n\\> Being able to spend my whole life with my boyfriend. Also having a lot of fun, like playing sports and video games a lot.", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}

But I still just can never truly grasp how things move through physical space.\n\n\\~ **How curious are you?**\n\nToo curious, according to previous therapists who wanted me to stop caring about where my emotions came from and why. Not curious enough, according to an INFJ 6 relative who questions me about things I've already decided I know enough about.\n\n**\\~ What are your curiosities about?**\n\nMainly, why people do things and what they feel about it, and the same regarding myself.

She isn't obsessed with being a good vs. bad person, isn't plagued with anxiety over everything, and lives with as much passion as she can.

I'm *always* processing my emotions.\n\n**\\~ How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nThey're one of my special interests, along with storymaking and personality.\n\n**\\~ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going?**\n\nAbsolutely. For ethical and political matters, though, I have to be feeling especially bothered or insecure to stay quiet.\n\n**\\~ Why?**\n\nWhy bother myself with strife unless I know it's unlikely to have consequences?\n\n**\\~ Do you break rules often?**\n\nYes. I prioritize acting according to my morals and I expect others to act according to theirs. If there's a problem, I expect them to speak up about whether my behavior is socially sound. So, I end up not remembering or even noticing other kinds of rules, especially unspoken ones, or reports of me breaking such rules that do not include interpersonal concerns. I need to pay attention more to rules and standards even when someone isn't directly telling me how they're hurt, where the moral misalignment lies, or what my role as a group member is. This is, unfortunately, complicated by my autism.\n\nThings work out better when people come talk to me with the hope that I have the potential to sync with them / the group, and the desire for mutual understanding, rather than suddenly deciding to spout judgments at me one day, or else I will *never* feel comfortable with that person/group again. I realize this is a personality difference and is not likely to be something I can just not be biased over, even though I wish for tolerance and appreciation of all personalities in theory.\n\n**\\~ Do you think authority should be challenged?**\n\nAbsolutely. I lack skill in this area, so I instead state or show I'm in opposition to an authority that isn't present.\n\n**\\~ If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nMy mindset is: If the rule isn't about directly preventing people from getting hurt, does it really matter all that much? *Sorry, 1s & SJs...*\n\n**\\~ What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nChilling, vibing, having fun, communal living, showing regular mutual appreciation, doing what you what when you want how you want where you want, not needing to constantly stave off overwhelm.\n\n...\n\nThe fact that this questionnaire barely asked me about my emotions makes me sad. They are sad and want attention.\n\n* **Sorrow:** A frequent visitor\n* **Shame:** The loudest, most demanding one\n* **Guilt:** The secondmost demanding one\n* **Envy:** The Problem Child^(TM), but also a gateway to confidence\n* **Moral Disgust:** A measuring tool\n* **Confusion:** A tormenter, but also forces me to figure things out\n* **Fear:** *\\*shaking\\** We do not speak of her...\n* **Anger:** Once allowed to roam free, then aggressively demonized, she is now my friend and prophesized savior (but is not allowed in the \"driver's seat\")\n* **Emptiness:** Once invisible to me, she is the fog my other emotions live inside\n\nI've had both an INFJ & INFP therapist. The INFJ 9 sx was too head-in-the-clothes and esoteric for me. The INFP 9 sp was an art therapist and wanted to make space for \"weirdos\", but she kept trying to curb my pursuit of further explanations, over and over again (but I got diagnosed with what she thought I didn't have, so, *ha!).*\n\nMy current therapist is an xNFx 6 and we get along *much* better. She immediately responds to what I bring up with connections and theories, for which I respond in kind, and we bounce off each other the whole appointment, every appointment. I come up with plans that do not come to fruitation because I end up just talking about whatever I feel like when I show up. She has a deck of archetypes and does tarot and I enjoy doing those with her sometimes. I had a close INTJ friend once; she and I could talk forever and ever, about psychology, personality, or whatever else. We both had had an edgy Nietzsche-ish teenage phase. Unfortunately, her Ni decided everyone who wasn't a blood relative was untrustworthy and terrible lmfao.\n\nLastly, my comfort artists are Florence Welch & Otep.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16px4fb)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

Also feel free to ask me anything if you think my answers weren't very helpful, I'll do my best to reply. \n\n**\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm 22, female. For starters I hate this type of questions, I don't really know what to say. I'm reserved, enjoy being alone, like learning new stuff but tend to get bored pretty fast, I'm a very anxious person and lazy which leads to a lot of procrastination.\n\n**\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNone.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nNo job, however, I'm studying to be an accountant, which was a hard choice to make since I'm interested in a lot of different fields.\n\n**\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nAs someone who enjoys being alone it would be an amazing weekend, definitely refreshing, especially if prior I had to be around a lot of people and socialize.\n\n**\u2022 \tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good  at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nIm lazy (sadly) so anything that requires physical activity is a pass for me. Also no activities in public spaces for me, there's people, it can be loud. I prefer to do stuff indoors alone or with people I'm comfortable with, like playing games, maybe some crafts.\n\n**\u2022 \tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What  are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nVery curious, I take interest in a lot of different subjects and just enjoy learning new things.\n\n**\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nAbsolutely not! I hate being in charge, however, in a group project, for example, if no one takes the lead I'll end up doing it myself since otherwise people don't seem to do anything, plus it helps better coordinate the group. Personally can't tell whether I'm good at it or not but I've been told that I am.\n\n**\u2022 \tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you  enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI honestly don't know, I do play videos games which require hand-eye coordination. I enjoy doing stuff with make hands and I'd say I'm fairly good at it, I had a period not that long ago where I was obsessed with origami and they did turn out pretty good.\n\n**\u2022 \tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular  artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of  art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nUnfortunatly no but i do enjoy music, dance, paintings, drawings and photography.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI try my best to focus on the present. While the past is important for we learn from our experiences, I try not to duel on it much, but still do from time to time (when it decides to come and haunt me out of nowhere). It's pretty much the same when it come to the future, it's uncertain therefore I don't really spend my time thinking about it.\n\n**\u2022 \tHow do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIf I'm busy I'm obviously going to prioritize myself, if I'm not though it depends. If the person is just trying to get me to do it for them absolutely not, if I notice the person actually needs help and I like them as a person I'll help but if I don't like them or I'm just indifferent I won't unless it benefits me in a way.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI'm not sure I understand exactly what this means but from what I've gathered logical consistency means there is no contradiction. If that is the case then, to some extent, yes, it's good to be consistent but I do believe we can benefit from contradictions. Just because there is consistency doesn't mean you're 'right'.\n\n**\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI do consider productivity to be important, and I feel kind of guilty everytime I realize I could've been more productive with my time, on the other hand, while it may be nice to be efficient I don't think it's as important.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nAs far as I'm aware no.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nPlaying video games, watching anime and reading manga and books. Honestly I just like it, I don't have a reason for it and I don't need one.\n\n**\u2022 \tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you  struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?**\n\nNot sure if there's a name for it but I need to put what I'm learning into practice and in a quite environment since otherwise I can't focus. I don't think I have a preference for how classes are taught but definitely no creativity or memorization for me, I'm not creative and have a bad memory.\n\n**\u2022\tHow good  are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable  tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you  go?**\n\nI'd say I'm somewhat good at strategizing. The thing is, I like to plan stuff out but I either end up changing my mind multiple times, like I'll come up with new ideas or a different way to do something, and some other times I'm just to lazy. \n\n**\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nProfessionally, I just want to succeed in something I can enjoy and that, hopefully, allows me to lead a financially comfortable life. Personally, wanna travel the world and just be a knowledgeable person.\n\n**\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nOne of my biggest fears is not succeding in life and never fully understanding myself. Something I hate is dishonesty.\n\n**\u2022 \tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of  your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI do daydream a lot, a bit unhealthy at times, but I'd say I'm still very attached to reality. While I use it as way to avoid dealing with real life problem I'm still aware I'll have to face them and most of the time can't actually focus on my daydreams because I'm stressed or anxious because of said problems. Also sometimes I use it to help me navigate real life by having conversations with the different characters in my head to either help me better understand a situation or how said situations could've affected me.\n\n**\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nFirst I'll think about how nice it is to be alone and then how boring it is. My thoughts can only keep me entertained for so long.\n\n**\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI hate making decision because it gives anxiety so I'll take as much time as I can and I'll change my mind multiple times before reaching a final decision. \n\n**\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nTo be honest I'm not sure, I don't really like to deal with emotions and definitely do my best to pretend they're not there when I'm aware of them. I see emotions as weakness.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nSometimes I'll agree with people simply because I don't have the mental capacity to deal with what could unfold were I to disagree. Plus I don't like conflict so I'll do my best to avoid it.\n\n**\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't usually break rules unless i find them unreasonable.   \n", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

She procrastinates a bit and tends to leave things to the last minute, but she will always end up finishing the task. she cuts corners and finds her own way of doing things to speed up the process but hey, if it works it works.\n\nEmotions: She\u2019s not very emotional, she\u2019s pretty awkward during emotional conversations and i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever seen her cry. shes not great at consoling people but she\u2019s great at helping you take your mind off things and cheer up. She has pretty thick skin too, but when something *does* upset her, she\u2019ll vent about the problem itself but avoids talking about how she\u2019s feeling at all costs.\n\nConfrontation: she\u2019s pretty mellow and never causes conflict, but she\u2019s not afraid of it either. if someone crosses her, she\u2019ll confront them civilly but she also won\u2019t beat around the bush or sugarcoat things.\n\nHumor: her sense of humor is a bit odd (but luckily mine is too lmao). She\u2019s sarcastic, we both make fun of each other (lovingly, ofc). she\u2019s really into dark humor too, nothing too crazy but we\u2019d def get cancelled if anyone heard our conversations \ud83d\udc80\n\nFriendships: I\u2019m an ISFP and we\u2019ve been friends for years. our personalities are pretty compatible, ofc we have our differences but we rarely ever clash. she\u2019s the type of person you can sit in silence with without it being awkward. She values her alone time and it\u2019s common to not hear from her for a bit, but it\u2019s nothing personal. she\u2019s very independent and gets doesn\u2019t like clingy/overly dependent friends. however, she really values loyalty in her friendships.\n\nRelationships: She has major commitment issues and she\u2019s never had a long-term relationship. She told me it has less to do with trust, and more to do with a fear of being pinned down. she said that relationships scare her because she wouldn\u2019t have the freedom to leave without hurting the other person in the process. \n\nHobbies: She\u2019s really into anime and genshin impact (but she doesn\u2019t tell people that lmao), she also loves South Park, Bojack Horseman, and she\u2019s obsessed with Bobs Burgers (she literally dragged me to the movie). She\u2019s not super into music but she LOVES eminem for some reason \ud83d\udc80\u2026she\u2019s an odd ball but that\u2019s why i love her. She also writes a lot, she\u2019s really good at coming up with unique storylines and complex characters. she\u2019s an amazing writer and she could totally make a career out of it, but she\u2019s in pre-med because it\u2019s more \u201cpractical\u201d\n\nthat was a lot but if i left out any crucial details, lmk!", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hello! If anyone could try to type meI would be very grateful :) i actually made a few cognitive fonction tests but I am clearly becoming too used to it and can see through the questions and predict my answers haha. So I might be biased. Anyway, here as some things about me:\n\n-I rarely do things for no reason. I really like doing art craft, but if there is no reason at the end of it, I probably won\u2019t have the motivation. For example, I like making little machines of cardboard. It\u2019s really fun to make, but if it\u2019s not something I will use or that my brothers requested from me, I won\u2019t see the point haha. I don\u2019t have much energy.\n\n-I like having debates on things that I have a strong opinion of and yes, I kinda want others to see that my point of view is \u00ab\u00a0the good one\u00a0\u00bb, even if i completely understand that it is stupid most of the time. However, if I see that what we are talking about is something the person really cares about (like a religion for instance), I will want them to feel good believing in it so I won\u2019t dare say anything of course. I actually never dare to say mean things bluntly even if they are the truth in my head.\n\n-I actually want others to feel happy in their life. I will try to be agreeable so that they feel good. I don\u2019t think I am the same person all the time. At school, I\u2019m kinder and more shy then at home. However, it\u2019s not a character I am playing, but more an other version of me that others will possibly like more. The eyes of the group never leave my mind, and I am extremely self-conscious all the time to look good. It can be pretty exhausting.\n\n-I often think \u00ab\u00a0if I don\u2019t like doing it, why waste energy on it? Life is short\u00a0\u00bb, and it\u2019s mostly at school when we are in french class haha (english is my second language, so french class is pretty much every day). I don\u2019t care as long as I pass, and it\u2019s not always because I\u2019m lazy, I just don\u2019t see the point of forcing myself on grammar that I have no pleasure of doing. People don\u2019t always realise that we are on a floating ball in the middle of the universe and that we don\u2019t actually matter on an external point of view so why take these things too seriously \ud83d\ude05 just do what you like doing\nA meaningful life is not all about accomplishments and career but mostly about finding happiness and loving\n\n\n-These are quotes I need to remind myself everyday \u00ab\u00a0yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0you can\u2019t suffer from the past nor the future. You only suffer from your memory and imagination.\u00a0\u00bb Actually, I am always trying to prepare myself for a future \u00ab\u00a0problem\u00a0\u00bb like a project or an event that stresses me before it happens. At the end, I use my imagination and see myself in the worst situation that could happen there and try to find solutions for it already. It\u2019s not good and I forget to live in the right now sometimes. However, it wasn\u2019t always like that. I used to be pretty chill about almost everything, but I was young so I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n-I try to take the personalities of characters i love  in movies that I watch, and all the time I see that the person I want to be is a zen person that float like water on life, just accepting it as it comes and not being worried of future events, inner peace and happiness and everything haha. I always try to be better for me and others.\nIt\u2019s weird because if I really like a show but someone (i don\u2019t even have to know them) say it\u2019s shit, then I won\u2019t like it as I used to. Same for the opposite.\n\n-I want others to feel good but still, I think we should all focus on our life (and humanity as a whole, like caring about the Earth) so I do things I like even if people think it\u2019s weird.\nI often find myself bad and and unworthy of the ones I love though.\n\n-I have patterns for things. Like winter and Christmas, it\u2019s certain musics and emotions I feel and then emotions change for the next season, and I know the vibe I am gonna feel. it does that for so many things like stories and songs.\n\n\n\nAnyways so I don\u2019t know what to write anymore sorry if it was boring!

{"submission": "I've gotten infp a lot as test results when I was younger- but I don't think I really understood myself then and I had stuck to 16personalities for results too.

Yeah I still value being polite and respectful towards others and would like to be there for those I care about, but I just don't have the energy for that nor do I feel I even understand my emotions very well. One might ask me how my day has been, and I will generally answer with \"here are things that happened\" and if you're lucky \"here is how I think I feel about it\". \n\nI have realized I don't understand others as well as I thought I did either (I am a late diagnosed autistic + adhd as per several mental health professionals) and it had shaken me to my core with who I thought I was.

If I'm not confident on something, I will not give you an answer because it's important to me that I'm not misleading you.

{"submission": "Hello guys, I've been pretty lost about my type and I wanted to ask you guys if y'all could maybe help me discovering my type? \nI know y'all don't know me personally enough to even slightly know my correct type but maybe you guys could tell me some differences and your thoughts on my description of myself? \n\n\nWell anyways, let's start of with Fi and Fe. The most difficult for me to decide.\nI'm someone that values my personal beliefs and I want to discover and know myself in every way possible. I wanna be sure of myself and keep my values but don't wanna violate social harmony in any way. I think that if I have to make a specific decision where others are involved, it's my duty as a human being to compromise. I wouldn't just sacrifice my values for other people but would like to work together that would include both of our values and not just our own. Kind of like combining them? Maybe sacrificing a little bit but our core values should stay. I would never want to violate others values and I normally sacrifice my own but if it's about my simple human empathy, it will stay and I will remain faithful to the values that are the most \"wholesome\" in a harmonic way for both, me and the others.\n\nNow let's continue with Te and Ti. I don't know at all what I am from both of those. Sometimes I think Te and sometimes Ti.\nIf I have to describe it then I would say that I mostly build up a system that goes along both ways. I focus on the details that I gathered and put them in a whole. I do believe in the others and I'm willing to listen. I mostly make my own conclusion out of things but also listen to the others. It's more like a pattern where I gather information from myself and others and all those informations are one big picture that I form together at the end to come to a conclusion.\n\n\nLet's continue with Ni and Ne because of the way that I described how I come to a \"decision\" is the same here.\nI gather information and then put them together and from one big picture.\nI relate to Ni a lot because I often come to conclusions that come out of nowhere and that I can't really explain either. I like to guess the outcome and I'm often right. I'm someone that likes to go in depth with specific things for the sake of going in depth with that specific thing. But sometimes I feel like Ne. I can be very creative with my outcomes and like to include multiple factors to make my ideas work. I can be a brainstormer too.\n\nSo let's move on to Se and Si.\nI think I'm Si. I'm not good for quick reactions. I'm often in thought and relate a LOT to including past experiences to the present one and rather focus on \"my inner body\" If that makes sense. I easly miss things in the outside world and I'm not that good with bodily sensations either. I think my Si/Se would rather be a third or even fourth functions than my second or first.\n\nI think I'm someone that probably has a Feeling/Intuitive function first. And then probably a thinking and sensing function.\n\nIt's confusing but my decisions/feelings/ideas kinda feel like that if I include (every) function:\n1. FX or Ni\n2. Ne or FX\n3.TX/i or Si\n4. Se/Te\n\nI often typed myself as INFP but then at the other hand (what doesn't make sense because they don't even have the same functions) INFJ.\nI considered ENFP but that doesn't really make sense for me", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Just thought it would be fun cuz I love typing my friends and I wanted the opinions of you guys :D \n\n1) she is a very, very confident person.

It\u2019s how she got her first bf so fast compared to many others (fyi we\u2019re 16). She also doesnt really think that far into the future, mainly always sticking to what is going to happen in the present/a few days after the present \n\n3) shes super competitive. She is more bothered by others doing better than her, even if she did well in something herself. For example, we just finished exams recently, and though she did pretty well for the exams, she was very butt-hurt when she heard that others did better. But this competitiveness always pushes her to do better. Now she is Doing all she can to achieve her goals. \n\nFrom what I know, she has Little to know Fe. She may have strong Se and Te I think.

{"submission": "\n- (They are female) They are very imaginative. They can view the world through the lens of cartoon style animations, cinematic shots, nostalgic song tracks, anime. They say they even unconsciously form cinematic posters and dramatic track sounds using any art style in their brain where people in their lives are the main characters.\n\nBut they are always in the corner, never being the highlight of it. Only the background character as if to show they are the observer and observing rather than being the part of the show.\n\n- They also imagine people in their life through all those ways. They also have this thing where they imagine everybody in their life as villains. Even me. Excluding their family.\n\n- It's kind of similar to how in WandaVision, Wanda is constantly imagining many intros. They definitely do the same. But they say they don't make any of the imagination positive. It's mostly negative or neutral. They kind of imagine parental abuse, neglect, drama despite never going through those things. Though they did experience emotional invalidation in their childhood.\n\nBut what I am mainly confused about is their high Fi and Ti:\n\n- When I see them solve a logical problem, I notice they need a lot of time to think about it. They want to read into every aspect of it.\n\nTheir thinking process is like: What is it? What is included and what isn't? What type of information can I use to do this problem? Why do we have to do those specific methods when there are easier ones? Let me search internet on this question/topic (they are really good at finding niche resources by making their search more specific). And then they get confused because they don't know if they are doing the correct or incorrect thing. And then that makes then procrastinate because they don't feel they know the subject enough or are not interested enough. \n\n- I also notice they check consistency of speeches of teachers. If a teacher says they will help students succeed but also say they think students should fail, they claim the teacher is not reliable or trustworthy because they said two contradictory beliefs or statements.\n\n-They do feel a lot. They can see the world in a bit romanticised way. \n-They are bad at knowing what to do with their emotions. They see it as something lurking under themselves and they don't know what to do other than see if it's okay to feel them or not and if not, they try to twist it into something else otherwise they let themselves cry in private. \n\nThey say they don't open up because they don't think the reasons for why they feel those particular feelings are justified enough to make them feel that way so they just try to manage them bit by bit so they can control it.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16x6mnu)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "* ***How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.***\n\nI am 21 years old, and a male. I can\u2019t really give a description of myself, because I don\u2019t truly understand who I am \u2013 I often put on a persona to conform to society. I focus on being liked by others so I suppress my personality. I don't have any friends because I don't open up to others for them to know who I am, instead, I am a mute blank canvas. \n\nAlthough, I would say I am socially anxious, reserved, and can be avoidant. However, at the same time, I get envious of those in the \u2018spotlight,\u2019 wishing I was in their place. My external persona is different from my internal or comfortable self. I seem irritated, logical, observant, and quiet. Though, I can be goofy, witty, helpful, and emotional. I prefer living inside my head rather than focusing on the external world.\n\n* ***Is there a medical diagnosis that impacts your mental/compartmental stability somehow?***\n\nI\u2019ve been diagnosed with social anxiety and OCD.\n\n* ***Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?***\n\nThere was some structure growing up. My family is Catholic which I still am, but I haven't attended church in years. My parents strived to instill the importance of common sense, efficiency, and education in my sisters and me. Which created a structured environment that didn't allow me to be myself completely. In structured settings such as school, I was a teacher's pet: quiet, rule follower, et cetera.\n\nAs a kid, I would whisk my friends on imaginary adventures creating new worlds. I was always outside, running around or climbing trees, rarely indoors. I preferred things to go my way. I tended to drift in and out of my circle of friends. Sometimes I would spend time with them, while other times I would disappear for a few weeks to pursue my own interests. However, I always returned as if nothing had changed. This is because I tend to forget about people and things if they are not present in my immediate surroundings.\n\nAlthough I love my family, I have some issues from my childhood. This has caused me to be very defensive and sarcastic, instigating and criticizing others before they can do the same to me. Also, I have this tension between conforming to my parent's and society's expectations and exploring my own identity.\n\n* ***What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?***\n\nCurrently, I am a senior in college majoring in political science, I thought about becoming an attorney; because I am a rule follower, and I like the logical/common sense thinking required. However, I hope to get my master's in history, and then a PhD in classics. My long-term goal is to become a classics professor. I like the idea of spending my time researching my interests with the independence/freedom, and creativity being a professor provides; and that I can dress more casually and not wear suits, which shouldn't be a factor, but is. Although, I enjoy school and am planning on doing it for seven more years; I do get burned out quickly if I am not interested in the material.\n\n* ***If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?***\n\nRefreshed; I am an introvert and enjoy having alone time to decompress. Although I hate being completely alone, I need to know others are around where I can see or hear them but don't have to socialize. Whenever I am alone, I tend to spiral into the chaos of my mind and become depressed and anxious. So, I enjoy being active, but alone.\n\n* **What is your relationship with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or an outdoor event? If an outdoor event, what is it? And why? If you tend to engage in something other than what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nI like being active and outdoors, but I am not particularly coordinated. Nor do I like to watch or play sports. But I do enjoy going for walks, yoga, and dancing \u2013 whenever I have the courage. I walk often as it allows me to think and reflect. I spend quite a bit of time sitting outside at parks or cafes drinking tea and people-watching.\n\n* ***How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?***\n\nVery. Well, I am curious about the topics I am interested in and spend hours going through Wikipedia. I wouldn't say I have more ideas than I can execute. I rarely have ideas, and when I do, I usually toss them to the side because they are unoriginal. In relation to the previous question, I do most of my thinking, reflecting, and introspecting when I am driving or walking out in nature. I can't sit at a desk and think, I need to be doing something \u2013 even taking a shower gets me thinking, but sitting at a desk\u2026nope.\n\n* ***Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art. If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise express what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.***\n\nI am artistic, but in no circumstances am I an \u2018artist.\u2019 I \u2018enjoy\u2019 writing and aspire to be an author and a poet, but I couldn't tell you the last time I wrote. I like music and am always playing it in the background. I usually listen to the same songs on repeat until I find others that catch my interest. I play the piano \u2013 not that I am any good. I enjoy attending art museums, mostly to look at sculptures from antiquity. It would be exciting to collect art one day and have my own collection.\n\n* ***What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?***\n\nTime is an interesting subject. The past and future are where I focus the most, I need to actively pay attention to the present. I am a nostalgic person. I am often reminiscing about the past \u2013 \u2018the good old days;\u2019 and how time has passed too fast. Though, most of my memories are pessimistic, how I missed out on the \u2018teenage experience.\u2019 I am always thinking and imagining the future, but I am never in the present enjoying it. Though I enjoy imagining the future, I am very delusional and unrealistic. Though, I do have this unhealthy obsession with \u2018societies\u2019 time-table; I feel if I don't have a career or house or get married at a certain age then I miss my only opportunity. \n\n* ***Do you need logical consistency in your life?***\n\nYes and no. I like having a schedule and am a creature of habit. However, I make schedules only to not follow through with them. Though my routines are something I have always followed. I also enjoy being logical, and became more so during my teenage years. I often question others and their facts. But in arguments, I don't use any facts, I am more controlled by my opinions and emotions \u2013 I throw spaghetti at the wall and hope others believe me.\n\n* ***How important are efficiency and productivity to you?***\n\nVery. I am very impatient and get irritated with others who are slow and incompetent. I am always looking at ways to make things more efficient, but I couldn't be the one to implement it. Although I am a procrastinator; I always wait until the very last minute to do anything.\n\n* ***Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?***\n\nI am an instigator, I say different things to get a reaction from others and sometimes to have them do something for me. My family has nicknamed me Gator because I do it often \u2013 I don't know why it's like second nature at this point. I like to learn information about others, not to gossip or manipulate them - I just like to have information - but that doesn't mean I haven\u2019t gossiped.\n\n* ***What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?***\n\nI like walking, playing video games, reading, watching TV, spending time with loved ones, and going down Wikipedia rabbit holes. I enjoy walking as mentioned before, because it allows me to be alone with my thoughts to introspect and think. I play games like Skyrim and World of Warcraft because I am interested in lore \u2013 rarely playing. I like reading and watching TV for the same reasons \u2013 escapism. I always think of myself as a character in different books or shows and create scenarios. I also spend time with my loved ones playing card games.\n\n* ***What are your aspirations?***\n\nProfessionally, I am hoping to get my MA and then a PhD to become a professor. I would love to spend my days researching my interests, teaching others, and having an impact, not only on their education, but lives. I have had a few impactful professors who have benefited my education, but also went above their job descriptions, and would love to be that person for others.\n\nPersonally, I am a hopeless romantic, so I hope to get into a relationship. Spend more time on my hobbies, so maybe I could become a published author one day. Overall, I aspire to live life to the fullest, as I have not and am not doing so.\n\n* ***What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?***\n\nMy biggest fears are losing my loved ones and time. It's hard to imagine my life without my family, and time seems to be slipping away too quickly. I often wish I could experience more of what life has to offer. I dream of living a thousand lives, and the number of times I've changed my goals, I could. Another fear of mine is failure. My parents have always pushed me to do my best, and I don't want to disappoint them or myself. I feel uncomfortable in physical or intimate situations, and dread hearing the words 'We need to talk.' I'm not good at opening up to others, but I crave intimacy with a partner.\n\n* ***What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?***\n\nStepping out of my comfort zone - enjoying life to the fullest. Whether that means dancing to my favorite song even if I am the only one. Taking long drives down backroads with the radio on and windows down. Laughing with my loved ones. Having hobbies. Taking care of myself physically and mentally. Doing my best, instead of procrastinating and doing mediocre work.\n\n* ***What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?***\n\nWhen I am stressed, I can get impatient with others. I feel like I have to do everything. I become reclusive and pessimistic. Hide who I am to keep the peace \u2013 always playing the diplomat. Doing the same thing over and over, not getting out of my comfort zone. Minuscule physical ailments drive me to think I am dying. \\*This has been me for the majority of the past seven years\\*\n\n* ***How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?***\n\nIt takes me a while to make decisions, as I usually make decisions with a mix of logic and emotions. I usually make a pro/con list, but then I end up going with what I feel is the best or what I am feeling at the moment. After, every time I make a decision I always look back and see what would have happened if I had chosen differently even if the decision I made was the best.\n\n* ***How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?***\n\nIt takes me a while to process my emotions, as I am not the best at knowing what I am feeling and why. My emotions also change often and drastically throughout the day. I feel emotions with intensity. Though, I repress and never express what I am feeling. When others want to talk about my emotions, I get passive-aggressive and sarcastic. I try to keep the harmony between people, so I don't let my emotions get caught up in the midst.\n\n* ***Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break the rules, why would you?***\n\nWhen it comes to breaking rules, it depends on the situation. If I am alone, I am way more likely to break the rules. But if I am with others, I follow the rules and don't like going against them, many of my family members say I follow rules too much.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "- Learning about many topics are very interesting. History, science, how things work and how they happened. Not just the bland learning videos that just explained short events, but things that go in depth, like battlefields, tactics, Jared Owen Vids, and in-depth vids of every structure like Math, Science, etc.\n- Learning about things is not a quick process, it takes time to fully understand for me, go more in depth with the topic itself so that I can have full mastery of it itself. I stutter when I don't have the time to fully go in depth with things at school. Like I need to understand everything, the whole concept just for it to make sense.

I wanted to help her, but I cant really understand how it feels to break up.\n- my family thinks my logic is somewhat weird and that I tend to be over analytical.\n- Is it me or I can come up with some idea in my mind.

Even after I visited disneyland and universal,  I basically drawed out my theme park. Every time I see something in real life, I basically want to create my own version.\n- Socializing has always been a hard task. Understand what to say is hard, like what am i supposed to say to other people. Being in a social environment is a lost world to me. Everyone knowing how to act and what to say, its a pain. I wish to get better at it, but its just a struggle for me. I was extremely stressed at one point due to the amount of social failures that it caused me to suddenly want attention, suddenly becoming more hypersensitive about how other people perceive me. Every time i suddenly remember memories of those failures, it suddenly causes me to want attention or to suddenly wanna do something that can help the world. I never realized I was clingy, but I tend to sometimes cling to people in relationships, especially with my cousin. I dont really mind breaking boundaries if I have a logical reason to do so because when helping, I do whats logical to me.\n- My memory has been great.

Do you like it? Why or why not? - I generally enjoy most of my subjects out of genuine interest (except PE because I'm not athletic), but I also tend to suffer from a combination of heavy workload and procrastination. I also enjoy the social aspect of school for the most part (to the point that I tend to search for connections within the social realm), but I tend to have issues socializing sometimes (more on social anxiety than shyness).\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel?

I've got a very melancholic temperament most of the time, but it's quite internal, I've been told I can be bossy and uncaring outwardly sometimes when I care about something, but when I don't I tend to be very laid back. I like writing... I mostly like writing in my head though haha, I rarely ever get anything out, my execution ability is... I don't want to say it's bad? Because I've never really tried, but, I have such a perfect layout of a plot for like an entire book in my head but it's so vague, when I actually attempt to lay it out I realise how little I have actually really thought it out - I mean this in the sense that I always only seem to have a \"general vibe\" and for some reason I always just see the end of the book, I know exactly how I want people to feel towards the ending.\n\n \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nGreat honestly! At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel?

This led me to come up with a better version: (imo) if someone came into my home, put a gun to my head and demanded I do an extremely simple task, or I die - and I have completely free will (atleast theoretically) to make whichever choice I wanted - do I actually have free will? If I value my life, logic commands me to complete the task - lets say its something extremely simple like there are no cons to completing it, like say, touching the wall in front of me - all logic commands me to complete that task. But in a way that isn't me making a decision is it? I'm being commanded by the circumstances of my external environment. So my idea was what if we made that pointless, unreasonable choice, just because? It's an absurd reasoning, sure, but a very human one imo.\n\n \n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot really, I mean, I can at times and I think I like doing things in my own way - honestly though I've never really been put to the test? And when I do get put into positions of leadership I get incredibly bossy and critical, I hate it.\n\n \n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not gonna go into much depth but I feel like it was worth touching on - I dislike it, a lot, although when I was a kid I remember loving to climb trees, building lego I mean until I turned around 14, I wanted to be a mechanic!\n\n \n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI think I do in a sense, yeah. I sometimes will say things just because I know that person will like me for it. I'm not a people pleaser in the slightest - in fact I actually can sometimes cause conflict just for the sake of it: like I remember often in highschool my friendgroup would come ask me to come out and even if I really wanted to, sometimes I'd just refuse... out of a sort of spite I think? But like I remember in school when I wanted to become popular, I sat next to a popular kid and analysed what kinda jokes made him laugh, I then made LOTS of those jokes and it worked!\n\n \n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have EXTREMELY high highs, like seriously. I mean. I even often have them in lows sort of? I sometimes dive into extremely cynical pits of sadness and I can often criticise people for just \"believing\" things - like saying \"oh I believe love is a powerful energy force\", I'm usually just like \"huh? How can you believe that?\" but I really do have moments where I think I get it! I just think sense drags me back down, which sucks a little I guess. I often get very weirded out by the notion of love, it can (and sometimes does) upset me greatly after those moments of \"highs\" when I come to the realisation that love is really all their is to live; I really hate the notion that \"happiness is the meaning to life\", I don't want to explain that but I hate it.\n\n \n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nNot very at all... I used to be! When I was a kid. And I remember in highschool I would always get terrified of being seen daydreaming so I just wouldn't. I remember fearing looking like my mum. I love her! So much, don't get me wrong, but she would always do this thing where she would just stare off into the distance and not think... I always wondered why she did that but I hated it, I didn't want to look like that.\n\nThank you so so so so so much for reading this!

{"submission": "hi, fairly new to typing myself. any help would be great.\n\nsome things about me goes as follows:\n\n\u2022 i can be a little arrogant with how i run my mouth sometimes. external validation i know is something i should avoid, which is hard when you don't have a proper sense of self.\n\n\u2022 i can be impatient due to stress or really just people who don't seem to get the point. this puts some strain on my relationships, but i've found i often get along with ppl who are chill with it. i also get along with low maintenance ppl. my best friends are them.\n\n\u2022 for organisation, i organise most of the time either physically or mentally. mentally is when i make routines or systems to make the next day a little easier. but, i do procrastinate often during \"overloaded\" days, feeling overwhelmed & numb.\n\n\u2022 i value art in any form. furniture, books, architecture, music - anything beautiful is worth being given a second glance at least, if i don't have the time or will in me to learn about it.\n\n\u2022 i spend most of my leisure time playing games, reading, or frankly just sleeping, which doesn't come a lot. i'm not sure if it's my time management, but i find i require more sleep than 8 hours to feel refreshed, hence i can't focus on my other hobbies and instead have to direct time towards studying.\n\n\u2022 my family's my priority, though some of them can say and do things i don't agree with. very rarely have i ever cut off a family member for breaking boundaries, but once i did, i've never let them in my life again.\n\n\u2022 i'm agnostic-atheist. religion to me is a form of control, & i hate being controlled by ppl who have no control over their usage of their logic. i don't know if there's a god. i don't believe in one.\n\n\u2022 i've been reluctant to get into the mbti community after seeing so many arguments against it. i'm trying it because i'm into self improvement, & i figured it can't hurt if i try yet still be able to acknowledge its weak points later. the same can't go for getting into religion. it can never be self improvement to me.\n\n\u2022 helping people is one of my greatest motivations to move through this life, though my expressions and words to others may not look the part. i'm not really unapproachable, but i also don't want everyone in my circle or probing into my personal matters. most around me just aren't contented with acquaintance, which is stupid and probably a fault of our culture here.\n\n\u2022 i love sceneries, nature, most to do with it.\n\n\u2022 i used to be spiritual, and though no matter how much i try to deny it, some of that stuff still sticks with me. it's irrational, yet sometimes i just automatically listen to my gut, soul, whatever you call it. i'm working not to dispel that but rather understand it better.\n\nthat's really all. thanks if you've read until here.", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\n#  I'm going to try be as open and vulnerable as possible, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much :)\n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. \n\nI'm a 16 year old male. I've got a very melancholic temperament most of the time, but it's quite internal, I've been told I can be bossy and uncaring outwardly sometimes when I care about something, but when I don't I tend to be very laid back. I like writing... I mostly like writing in my head though haha, I rarely ever get anything out, my execution ability is... I don't want to say it's bad? Because I've never really tried, but, I have such a perfect layout of a plot for like an entire book in my head but it's so vague, when I actually attempt to lay it out I realise how little I have actually really thought it out - I mean this in the sense that I always only seem to have a \"general vibe\" and for some reason I always just see the end of the book, I know exactly how I want people to feel towards the ending.\n\n \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nGreat honestly! At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI think I'd like it... I usually get very tired just from the outside world... I always get home from college basically dead haha...\n\n \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious! I think? I love coming up with ideas, I think the way I view the world is probably the core of my entire identity. I have a very very strange way of seeing things I think...

{"submission": "Childhood (< 12) - Happy, hyperactive, extraverted, imaginative, good with adults, heavy reader, big vocabulary, sensitive, took well to theater and acting but not sports, enjoyed running around in the woods, not good with kids own age/bullied heavily, could become loud and annoying in class and other large group situations. Parented like perfect little gifted child.\n\nYoung teens (13-15) - Only child, fighting in the house, mother with unpredictable outbursts. Used \"creativity\" to make memes and mean jokes about others behind their backs in order to stop being bullied but nice in person, couldn't shut up or stop making jokes in class. Insecure, lonely, \"edgy\" phase. Hyperaware of how everyone else dressed, behaved, and the slang they used and spent way too much time copying in order to fit in. Stopped reading, stopped doing theater. \n\nMiddle teens (15-17) - Awareness of girls kicked into full gear which magnified loneliness and anxiety tenfold. Mom became overbearing and clingy, parents fought more. Firmly stuck in viscous cycle of intense loneliness and trying to stand out by insecurely \"being funny\" or \"deep\", which meant saying very strange things in class which made isolation worse. Simultaneously trying to fit in and stand out so you had a weird lanky kid in air jordans loudly saying some shit about the moon being alive and then nervous laughing. COVID also hit. Always been a messy, disorganized procrastinator, but schoolwork actually became impossible and worse than death. Went on night hikes and listened to music to try and make myself less alone. Just wanted love and connection, and thought being weird attention whore would get me there when it really just made my problem worse. When I felt alone, I would post something weird I thought would make people react and then sit waiting for notifications in a cold sweat. Hopeless romantic too, love language was 6+ hour long conversations about religion, politics, and other deep, human related topics. Whenever I talked to a girl I would imagine all these whimsical, dreamlike dates we would go on and then get a pit in my stomach and break down when she didn't respond. All the music I liked was about love, and all the movies I liked were whimsical and involved some sort of depressed person finding meaning. Still very curious. Wrote a lot of short stories about love, death, family, religion, and belonging. Went on google maps for fun, youtube rabbit holes about society and culture. started drawing. Very nostalgic too so into liminal spaces, exploring dead malls, etc... Got into typology, typed as ENFP (very unhealthy and immature, so probably not real type).\n\n(18-19) - Three antidepressants later. Still lonely, still looking for love and community, still loud and annoying, Life in shambles, smoking weed and drinking all the time. Trouble processing time (whatever is happening now will be happening forever), emotional desperation turned into sexual desperation, no standards, no backbone, people pleaser, easy to manipulate. Lost, out of control, trouble with authority and being told what to do, feel like a 14 year old. Still having trouble with organization and messiness. Trouble in relationships because cannot say no and no consistant hobbies, dreams, or motivation. Get bored of people and things easily. Envious not just of what people have, but of who they are as people. Impulsive and guilty about it. Frying my brain with carts so heavy disassociation. Creativity, intelligence, curiosity, and emotional depth formerly used to define self-esteem now disappearing so left with nothing. No enjoyment of learning, music, hiking, or anything else. Dropped out of college, worked at a car dealership, quit because I couldn't sleep at night scamming people, got very sick and depressed for months while my parents were doing nothing but fight. Weed and cigarettes. Narcissistic traits piling up like crazy. Worked as an amusement park mascot, quit because they were too controlling. \n\n(19 part 2) - Moved in with my grandparents and my personality is changing immensely. I like physical activity more, I find my emotional intelligence increasing, and my sad, insecure Fi is being oddly replaced by a more secure Fe. I like being around people, but I also like time for self-reflection. I enjoy problem-solving. I feel insanely guilty for being narcissistic, impulsive, and self-centered for all those years. My goals for the future used to be creative, but now are more humanitarian. Either bamboo cultivation, urban planning, or even firefighting if I can get my shit together. I am taking an Environmental Science and an Anthropology and I love both of them. Less inclined, almost averse to making things about me because I know how alone it made me feel and don't want to embarrass myself again, but Fe feels forced, like I am training myself to be the kind of person who will finally find lasting love and community through kindness and curiosity. Envy is going away, trying to become quieter and truly interested in others for who they are. Trying to turn people-pleasing instinct into actually being helpful. The only time I'm really talkative is asking questions in class. There used to be itch to immediately say what was on my mind, but I am getting it under control and listening is more fun now. Quit weed, had mood swings for the first couple of weeks, but they are evening out now. There are intense bouts of depression and self hatred for the person I used to be, and dread that I still am that person, but I am starting to become comfortable with being alone, single, and not having attention on me. I have never been able to discover myself before. When I feel something narcissistic, want to talk about myself, or be clingy, I am getting pretty good at shocking myself out of it. I still don't have hobbies, but certain dreams are beginning to form. Learning from, studying, and doing things for other people is fun because other people are generally pretty cool. I have noticed myself becoming somewhat of the therapist friend when I'm in group situations now. I will get love and community if I am kind, caring, and respectful.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}

Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nVery much refreshed in most cases, but I would probably miss my close friends a bit. As long as I have YouTube and music though, I can spend any indefinite amount of time without proper human interaction.\n\n\n\u2022 What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nHmm... well, I'd probably rather stay at home, but I'm assuming that isn't an option here. I'd choose a simple sport: hiking. I don't do it much, but it's just the perfect refresher from human interaction I need some days. \n\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am very curious and eager to learn about any and everything. I like learning. When I'm brainstorming I usually throw out a couple ideas, and then choose one. that one. the perfect idea!!!!!!!!!! but really I do just forget about my other ideas when I choose one. my curiosities usually go over the unknown, over the symbols that aren't written, the words that aren't said. It's just interesting to me.\nmy ideas usually come out of seemingly nowhere, and they're usually conceptual, like: \"oh, I could use x idea for a conlang! that's so cool!\" and that's how most of my conlang ideas appear. I can't just have an idea unless I have something to base it on, or some meaning to give it, if that makes sense.\n\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nthis depends lots on context. generally speaking, I think I would enjoy being a leader, just gets things how I want them. I like to think I'd be a good and fair leader, but I seldom actually get the opportunity to lead any group, so idk. my leadership style is - I think - trying to individually coach everyone in the group to do the tasks they're best at, and to improve themselves and their skill set. if stuff is all going wrong though I do tend to take on a more assertive role and just tell people what to do because I *said so*.\n\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not exactly sure what this is asking, but I think I know how to use my body to do stuff quite well, though admittedly my spatial awareness is a bit horrible sometimes. I do draw sometimes and it's quite fun, so if that counts, I do work with my hands. \n\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art\nplease likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI think I am artistic. I like to create conlangs (constructed languages) that look like naturalistic, unsuspecting languages, but hide in their patterns and vocab little nuggets about how I see the world. because languages are really just different slices of the same world-sized pizza, so why not make my own?\nI also draw sometimes as I said, but I just draw my Wings of Fire OCs like \"ooh Kastano n anhydron go kissy kissy\" most of the time. it fun.\n\n\n\u2022What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI feel like they're all equally important to understanding the whole, though I do give priority to the present and future, since it's the things I can readily manipulate, not the have-beens and the can't-changes of the past. I also wonder a lot about different possible pasts, how they could've affected the present, etc. as for how I deal with them, I think I try to use the present to my advantage to try and manipulate and steer the future in a positive direction, and I learn lessons from the past.\n\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI would think about it for a moment, then accept if feasible. else I'd politely decline and offer alternatives. I think. I would just help them because I can help them; they need help, I offer it. I want to see them succeed.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nby this I assume routine, and honestly I don't usually keep a routine. like, I do write down all my homework in a piece of paper as to not forget, but that's about it. it's all in my head. routine doesn't give me my space for \u2728creativity\u2728.\n\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nit's certainly important, however it seems to me society asks for both of those things from people like me who prefer to do their own thing and just chill out, which I see the harm in that. it's telling people to be things they don't want to be to fit into a model imposed by the stronger. it's living life in a fake way, in my opinion. I think everyone should pursue their own personalised happiness and fulfillment.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nwell, sometimes I do do that by manipulating my environment and way of being to make a person feel a certain way about something, but only to help them or for a better cause.... I think. maybe I have done it for my own happiness sometimes, but I don't think I have.\n\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nmy main hobby is linguistics, specifically the fields of phonetics and historical linguistics. I really enjoy seeing things evolve and play out and change and see the similarities and origins of things we take for granted. it's also a nice exercise for seeing the world from different perspectives.\n\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI'm not really sure what my learning style is, I have found however that subconscious learning, where I forget I'm learning something, has worked for me in many different situations. I really struggle with drill-based classrooms and work for the sake of working, it takes away all my interest in learning. if I can be creative and fun with the thing I'm learning, it's going to be a lot easier for me to learn.\n\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nhonestly, depends. but generalizing a bit, I first break objects into manageable tasks.... to then completely ignore my checklist and do whatever and fix whatever imperfections there are at the end. that's actually how I've been answering this lol.\n\n\n\u2022 What's important to you and why?\n\nprobably truth and freedom are my two most important values. I feel like life is fake in a way without them, and I don't want life to be fake.\n\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations?\n\nI wish to study at the university of Helsinki, and I have everything calculated so I can get there and stay up. I also want to get a friend group of people I connect with, which I am working on doing. I want to master my hobbies to be a knowledgeable person prepared for life.\n\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear being left out, seen as useless, being judged behind my back, insulted... I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone. the sound of people chewing makes me really uncomfortable and annoyed, it's just so eugh.\n\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\ntimes when I felt happy and connected with the people and things around me, when love surrounded me and my soul.\n\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nthe opposite of that. dark times without anyone understanding or appreciating my existence, hate all around me, feeling judged and rejected. Feeling useless myself.\n\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI am not that attached to reality. I daydream a lot every day, at the bus, in the car, before bed, it's just something that comes out naturally. and I'm slightly aware of my surroundings while I do so, like, I know whether I'm in a bus or my bed, and if that guy is gonna sit beside me or not.\n\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nagain, depends. probably about something I was thinking about the other day, or a problem I have, or just the people close to me. I daydream about lots of things. also I'd probably ask myself why I'm in a blank room with nothing for me to do and no-one to talk to. \n\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nstory of my life. I'm very very very indecisive, and I usually have these \"instant regret\" moments after taking a decision, where I momentarily think the other choice would've been better in the long run or something.\n\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI need as much alone time as I can get tbh. emotions are a really big part of me I think. I try to keep everyone happy, including myself, and raise spirits and help others develop into their best selves.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nnot really. If I have a strong opinion on something, chances are I'm going to voice it regardless. I think everyone has their own view of life and existence, and that it should be shared and accepted if not inherently bad or hurtful as to understand different perspectives and improve one's own to find \"the real truth\", whatever that is.\n\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nrules that are chosen for a reasonable reason and that can be applied as universals are fair, in my opinion. and they should be followed. now, the rules I have no problem breaking are those established so that the power-hungry can get more power. you know what I'm talking about. they're inherently bad and unjust, and something should be done about them.\n\n\n\u2022 What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nkissanp\u00e4iv\u00e4t. time for myself. stable job and house. comfortable everywhere. no judgment from others. my friends are close to me and true. I enjoy my occupation and have time for my hobbies.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/170ugyk)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hey everyone ! This is my first Reddit post :)\nSo, I\u2019ve been really into MBTI for months now but I\u2019m not sure about my type. Like a lot of ppl, I\u2019ve been mistyped on 16p as INFP but as I dug into cognitive functions, I started thinking that I was ISFP. But I need confirmation from people that probably know more things about MBTI than me..\n\n/!\\ I\u2019m sorry this post is so long, and thank you to all of those who will take time out to read and maybe type me :)\n\n\n\n\n- How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m 18F. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m great at expressing myself through words so excuse me if I\u2019m not very clear (+ English isn\u2019t my first language, so don\u2019t hesitate to correct any grammar errors !!)\n\nI would say that I\u2019m overly kind to everyone (even people that don\u2019t deserve any sympathy, I still see qualities in anyone), I\u2019m always here to help my friends - e.g notes, revision sheets for exams or love advice.\nBut I worked on it since middle school and now I can say no when it crosses my boundaries and I stopped being a total people pleaser. Now idc of what people think of me and I\u2019m so much happier since.\n\nI\u2019m someone who likes being alone and I\u2019m a homebody but I still love visiting and walking around cities.\nI don\u2019t particularly enjoy socializing but I still do it pretty often, I love talking to people about everything, discovering new things or sharing my interests. I\u2019m not really shy but more \u00ab\u00a0introverted\u00a0\u00bb or reserved so I don\u2019t really share personal matters, thoughts etc (I don\u2019t like people knowing too much, and being seen as weak)\n\nI can be really stubborn about some topics I can be a pain in the ahh to convince. I\u2019m lowkey competitive as hell (I get sulky when I lose, I just HATE the feeling of losing a game). And I swear a lot.\nI also love gossip (ik it\u2019s bad but it\u2019s so entertaining \ud83d\ude2d)\nI would say that I\u2019m a chill person overall.\n\n\n\n\n- Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental comportamental stability somehow?\n\nAs far as I know, I don\u2019t have any type of medical diagnosis that could impact my behavior. Ofc it\u2019s not impossible but very unlikely in my case.\n\n\n\n\n- Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nIn my family, we\u2019re pretty much all christians. I was raised with religious morals but not extreme at all, I was taught values and morals like courage, love, respect, do no harm etc. So it only brought me positive values that I still apply to this day because it just makes sense for everyone, religious or not. \n\nI\u2019m so lucky to have a family like mine but my parents have two different parenting style : \nMy mom has a pedagogical parenting style. She establishes a certain framework for our safety, only punishing us when we do something stupid (like putting ourselves in danger unnecessarily) and is very attentive to our emotions. In short, a dream mum. I have a very close relationship with her and I\u2019m not afraid of being completely open with her about my emotions and thoughts. We tell each other EVERYTHING. My love language is physical touch so we hug a lot and I kiss her forehead a lot. I literally cannot live without her, I was so anxious to move for my studies last month and I call her every single day when I\u2019m not back at home.\n\nMy dad has more a detached parenting style. Unlike my mom, he is not someone who likes to express their emotions (besides anger lmaoo). He doesn\u2019t ask questions about school except for what I ate, he doesn\u2019t know my besties names, he doesn't treat my mother the way she deserves to be treated (as the queen she is). He still assures for my safety because he loves me, but he never shows it like I would like him to (he doesn\u2019t kiss my cheek and he hugged me recently because I moved but except for that\u2026 we don\u2019t have any physical contact). We argued a lot during my puberty because I stood up a lot more for my beliefs that weren\u2019t the same as his. But I still love him a lot.\n\n\n\n\n- What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI\u2019m studying psychology ! I just started last month but it is so so interesting so far and I love it so much like- it's so reassuring to know that I haven't made a mistake about my future career.\nI love studying the human mind, mental health and pathologies, how to help people get better and different types of therapies, influences we are unaware of and how to detach ourselves for society\u2019s norms\u2026 it\u2019s so fascinating. I can wait to start working in this field (but I still have to wait 5 more years\u2026)", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. \n\nI'm a 16 year old male. I've got a very melancholic temperament most of the time, but it's quite internal, I've been told I can be bossy and uncaring outwardly sometimes when I care about something, but when I don't I tend to be very laid back. I like writing... I mostly like writing in my head though haha, I rarely ever get anything out, my execution ability is... I don't want to say it's bad? Because I've never really tried, but, I have such a perfect layout of a plot for like an entire book in my head but it's so vague, when I actually attempt to lay it out I realise how little I have actually really thought it out - I mean this in the sense that I always only seem to have a \"general vibe\" and for some reason I always just see the end of the book, I know exactly how I want people to feel towards the ending.\n\n \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nGreat honestly! At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI think I'd like it... I usually get very tired just from the outside world... I always get home from college basically dead haha...\n\n \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious! I think? I love coming up with ideas, I think the way I view the world is probably the core of my entire identity. I have a very very strange way of seeing things I think... I came up with a concept recently that I found super interesting. I have a few in mind after saying that so I'm just gonna flip a coin to decide lmao. Okay, this one - so I was wondering initially (this is what led me to the final though) \"if someone gets put on a machine that makes them feel unfathomably good, and then get taken off of it and given the chance to stay off or go back on, do they have a choice or does their external environment just command them?\". This led me to come up with a better version: (imo) if someone came into my home, put a gun to my head and demanded I do an extremely simple task, or I die - and I have completely free will (atleast theoretically) to make whichever choice I wanted - do I actually have free will? If I value my life, logic commands me to complete the task - lets say its something extremely simple like there are no cons to completing it, like say, touching the wall in front of me - all logic commands me to complete that task. But in a way that isn't me making a decision is it? I'm being commanded by the circumstances of my external environment. So my idea was what if we made that pointless, unreasonable choice, just because? It's an absurd reasoning, sure, but a very human one imo.\n\n \n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot really, I mean, I can at times and I think I like doing things in my own way - honestly though I've never really been put to the test? And when I do get put into positions of leadership I get incredibly bossy and critical, I hate it.\n\n \n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not gonna go into much depth but I feel like it was worth touching on - I dislike it, a lot, although when I was a kid I remember loving to climb trees, building lego I mean until I turned around 14, I wanted to be a mechanic!\n\n \n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI think I do in a sense, yeah. I sometimes will say things just because I know that person will like me for it. I'm not a people pleaser in the slightest - in fact I actually can sometimes cause conflict just for the sake of it: like I remember often in highschool my friendgroup would come ask me to come out and even if I really wanted to, sometimes I'd just refuse... out of a sort of spite I think? But like I remember in school when I wanted to become popular, I sat next to a popular kid and analysed what kinda jokes made him laugh, I then made LOTS of those jokes and it worked!\n\n \n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have EXTREMELY high highs, like seriously. I mean. I even often have them in lows sort of? I sometimes dive into extremely cynical pits of sadness and I can often criticise people for just \"believing\" things - like saying \"oh I believe love is a powerful energy force\", I'm usually just like \"huh? How can you believe that?\" but I really do have moments where I think I get it! I just think sense drags me back down, which sucks a little I guess. I often get very weirded out by the notion of love, it can (and sometimes does) upset me greatly after those moments of \"highs\" when I come to the realisation that love is really all their is to live; I really hate the notion that \"happiness is the meaning to life\", I don't want to explain that but I hate it.\n\n \n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nNot very at all... I used to be! When I was a kid. And I remember in highschool I would always get terrified of being seen daydreaming so I just wouldn't. I remember fearing looking like my mum. I love her! So much, don't get me wrong, but she would always do this thing where she would just stare off into the distance and not think... I always wondered why she did that but I hated it, I didn't want to look like that.\n\nThank you so so so so so much for reading this! If you know any insights into what type I might be then please let me know - this stuff is really really hard lmao.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "So basically, I have been very obsessed with mbti ever since this summer and I have been researching it non-stop.

I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just an enfp trying to be an infj. but I am NOT an extrovert, I just can\u2019t handle having a simple conversation for a long time, and research refuels me.

I love organizing things and making them tidy, I love specific due dates and times, but I can\u2019t KEEP things tidy for the life of me, and I end up stuck in adhd-paralysis procrastinating things until they are due.

{"submission": "Hey everyone! As the title says, I\u2019m struggling to pinpoint what my type is. To summarize my personality. I\u2019m a fairly reserved person and I\u2019m pretty shy, but I\u2019m far from a misanthrope. I\u2019ve always had a great deal of empathy and when I\u2019m with people I\u2019m comfortable with I can be the loudest and most energetic person in the room. In the small talk stage of a conversation, I\u2019m awkward and not a very skilled communicator, but I excel in debates and generally intellectually stimulating conversations, and I\u2019d say I\u2019m a pretty good story teller as well. Basically, I crave conversations with others that have substance but I\u2019m a little too shy and reserved to ever get there with a lot of people.\n\nOn top of that, I\u2019m very interested in world events and I myself am interested in a political career, prior to that I was interested in journalism. My ultimate and simultaneously selfish and selfless desire in life is to influence and change human society in a positive way; a way that\u2019d cement my place in history and ensure I\u2019d obtain the respect I feel I deserve, while also allowing me to address the problems in the world that make me so angry. I\u2019m frustratingly unmotivated and lazy, though, and this actively sabotages my (hypothetical) attempts to achieving my goals. Both my shyness and lack of motivation frustrate me greatly and I\u2019ve taken active steps towards working on them so I can hopefully eventually mold myself into the type of person needed to achieve the things I wish to.\n\nI\u2019m well aware that my ambitions are quite unrealistic and I may be setting myself up for disappointment and dissatisfaction, but I\u2019d feel that if I never tried anyway so I might as well work towards it. I\u2019m always living in my head, thinking about any number of random things, frequently about the future though and what positions I might find myself in. These are more daydreams than plans, though. If you need me to elaborate on anything, or have any questions, feel free to ask.

{"submission": "My dad passed away nearly 5 years ago now, and I would like to type him to better understand his past actions and thought processes.\n\n- He was very sporty and active when he was younger. He especially did a lot of basketball and martial arts and had a 6 pack. Played more golf when he was older and participated in golf competitions too.\n\n- He told us a lot of stories from the past, of other people and of himself, and the lessons he wanted us to learn from them.\n\n- Had anger issues and a short temper very sporadically.\n\n- He was a successful businessman, and the money he earned he would always reinvest back into the business (rather than in assets/property).\n\n- He liked adventures and experiences, would go explore new sights such as cliffs and rivers. Liked travelling.\n\n- Liked buying luxury items. He would never skimp when buying things, would always buy the best or near best products he could afford. Often thought more expensive = better. He liked to buy things for the sake of buying things (perhaps it was newness of them that he liked).\n\n- Held cultural events and traditions to great importance. We would always celebrate cultural holidays properly (i.e., buying all the proper decorations and having the proper traditional kitchenware).\n\n- Didn\u2019t show emotion a lot.\n\n- Was a very honest and principled man. Once a solicitor undercharged us by nearly \u00a31000, we went back to pay them the full amount. I think he did believe in karma.\n\n- Used to do calligraphy.\n\n- Placed heavy emphasis on filial piety when we were growing up.\n\n- Would buy us a lot of random gifts, even whenever he went to the supermarket (e.g., I had a phase where I liked candles a lot and he probably bought me about 5 candles across different occasions).\n\n- Trusted traditional medicine much more than modern medicine. This probably applies to other things as well.\n\n\nIn the last few years of his life, I think he was a very unhealthy version of himself (didn\u2019t help that he had health issues so that he couldn\u2019t do all the things he used to do. He would get frustrated about this a lot). My best memories of him come from this time, when I was a teenager, so my recollection could be off.\n\nI am thinking ISTJ, the things that are stopping me are that my dad seemed to have strong Se, and I also don\u2019t really understand the Te function (I don\u2019t have it in my own stack).

So I don't shy away from my personal values and see them as an asset from evolution, a potent spice that is passion that make our lives worth living. I don't see my values as the objective truth - I just believe that everyone has different values, and that they all have important perspectives to grant to society. And so, I\"ll grant society the perspective of my values, and I see that as my evolutionary duty.

{"submission": "Hello! mbti is something I have always heard about but never really gotten into until recently, and I've been trying to type myself with no luck (I'm still very new so I'm not suprised but I thought I'd give it a shot) so I did the Type Me questionnaire to see what you guys think!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI\u2019m 23, I\u2019m a woman, and I\u2019m currently out of college, and I\u2019m working at a country club in administration. I have a simple life, but I like it that way. I still live with my parents temporarily until I can save up enough money to move out. I basically go to work, go home, play video games, read, and talk to my parents and my friends and my boyfriend.\n\n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was very traditional with nothing out of the ordinary. My childhood was mostly calm and I was a very sheltered kid. The worst thing that happened during my childhood was that my parents would argue a lot at times, but it didn\u2019t really affect me super negatively.\n\nI had a very large religious influence. My mom was teaching me how to sing Christian songs before I could talk and taking me to church before I could even remember it. I grew up in the typical Christian Southern American home basically. When I was very young I responded well to it because it was all I knew, really. I didn\u2019t even consider or think about any other possibilities because I was around it so much as a kid. However, in high school I joined a Christian youth group that really turned me off to Christianity in general. It was a toxic place that had me feeling guilty for stupid shit and it was also super cliquey which I did not enjoy. I eventually stopped going there and then stopped going to church altogether. This was met with little resistance by my parents because mom had stopped going to church years ago just because she didn\u2019t feel like waking up early on a Sunday, which is very fair. I hated it too.   \n\n* **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI work in administration at a country club. It is an OK job, but I definitely do not want to do this for the rest of my life. I think it bothers me the most because it\u2019s like, sort of customer service but not fully? For example, my day-to-day is I sit at my desk and work on different administrative tasks and answer the phone. However, if a member of the country club comes up to my desk I\u2019m obviously expected to help them. I hate that part so much because it just feels like I\u2019m constantly getting interrupted by whatever I\u2019m doing. I know that this isn\u2019t caused by a general dislike of customer service, though, because before this job I was a waitress for 4 years and I loved it. I think my brain has to sort of be in that \u201ccustomer service\u201d mode to be able to handle it easily/enjoy it. When I\u2019m trying to work and people come up to me asking dumb questions or trying to make small-talk when I genuinely don\u2019t care it annoys me a bit. I also don\u2019t like that I don\u2019t have an office. I\u2019m at the front desk so everyone who walks in, walks by, or anything comes into contact with me and it makes me tense for some reason. I do like the administrative work aspect of the job, though. I love spreadsheets, data entry, updating the restaurant\u2019s POS system, etc etc. I think I would enjoy my job much more if it was more secluded.\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel refreshed for sure. I\u2019ve always been good at keeping myself company. Honestly, unless it\u2019s my boyfriend, my social battery is usually super low. I like talking to friends and seeing them, but I can never do it for a long time or super often. I burn out very quickly.\n\n* **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI don\u2019t really prefer any sort of physically demanding activities except for maybe working out. I used to really enjoy the gym a couple years ago and I\u2019ve been meaning to go back. Otherwise, I prefer relaxing activities like watching anime or reading or playing games. I also enjoy stuff like shopping or going out to eat somewhere. I used to be rly good at softball when I was younger, but I haven\u2019t played since my sophomore year of high school. I really, really enjoyed it though. \n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am a curious person. I really like to learn about new things. I\u2019m super interested in space and the mysteries around it, as well as more far-fetched ideas that I don\u2019t necessarily believe in, but I just think they\u2019re fun to learn about. Some of these include stuff like cryptids, conspiracy theories, weird disappearances/unexplainable events, etc etc.\n\nI definitely have more ideas than I can execute. I have a lot of random aspirations and hobbies I want to try that will probably not go anywhere because it isn\u2019t humanly possible to do such a diverse amount of things. If I wrote down all of them it would sound like I want to become my Skyrim character.\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI don\u2019t think I would enjoy nor be good at a leadership position. The thought of having to make decisions for an entire group of people doesn\u2019t sound like something I\u2019m good at nor does it sound appealing at all.\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI can be coordinated in some ways, and not coordinated in others. Even though I love video games, I\u2019m not very good at them, at least not naturally. If I want to improve or get good at a video game I have to try really hard and play a lot. I also tend to drop or knock into things often in my day-to-day life. However, as I mentioned before, I was really good at softball, which requires coordination. I don\u2019t really like working with my hands in activities such as crafts. I tend to get impatient quickly as I\u2019m also not good at things like that.\n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI am generally not an artistic person. I have always wanted to learn how to draw, but I never have taken the time to learn. That being said, I also just am generally not creative with visual arts. Most of my time spent learning how to draw was to just draw my favorite fictional characters or something similar, but I never had super creative original ideas that I wanted to paint or draw. However, I used to enjoy creative writing a lot. I used to write a lot of short stories based on one-sentence prompts. Those were always super fun to do. I have also had novel ideas back in early high school that had me feeling very inspired to write, but I never got far with them.\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe Past: I see it as a learning tool for the most part. I try to learn from my past mistakes and experiences, however I don\u2019t always do so. The past is also crippling for me at times, because I sometimes can take great measures to avoid the bad parts of my past repeating, which usually aren\u2019t needed nor helpful. They could even cause a self-fulfilling prophecy. I use the past as a tool, but the past also usually is a big cause of my anxiety\n\nThe Present: I am most at peace when thinking about the present because it is the only one I can actively control. I know exactly what\u2019s going on and I can still control my actions, whereas in the past you can\u2019t, and the future is unknown. I tend to just let the present go past me without paying much attention to anything other than what I\u2019m doing or who I\u2019m with.\n\nThe Future: How I feel about my future changes with my mood or mental disposition. I can look at my future and be excited and hopeful one day and be anxious and fearful the next. It genuinely depends on my outlook at the current moment, which usually is determined by my mental health and environment. The biggest thing I don\u2019t like about the future is the unknown. The unknown aspect of the future makes me feel uneasy.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIt really depends on the person and the task. With people closest to me, I will do nearly anything to help them if I can, and if a stranger really needed my help with something and didn\u2019t seem suspicious I would help them as well. I generally like to be a helpful person, but of course I have limits and they change depending on the person and the request. My general reasoning would be out of love/care for the person, or because it\u2019s the nice/right thing to do and it doesn\u2019t inconvenience me much.\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI strive for logical consistency, but it is hard for me to stay completely logical when I need to be. I tend to let my emotions get in the way of my logical or sometimes even rational thoughts, and I let those lead me to my conclusions/decisions rather than logic.\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nProductivity is important to me. I\u2019m generally a lazy person, but I strive for productivity and generally use it as a way of measuring how \u201ctogether\u201d my life is. For example, if I\u2019m following a daily routine and sleeping healthily and making sure I need to get everything on my to-do list done, I generally just think more highly of myself than if I did the bare minimum. I think about it a lot and it\u2019s a lot of the reason why I focus so much on lists and routines, because it\u2019s an ideal that I see as very important to me, even if I don\u2019t always achieve it.\n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI generally do not control other people\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy hobbies are playing video games, reading, and watching anime. I like all of these hobbies for the same reasons. I love them because they\u2019re cozy, relaxing, and I can experience whole other worlds through each medium. Video games are less this way, because I don\u2019t play a lot of story-based games. Video games for me are more about being competitive or keeping my hands busy.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI\u2019m honestly better at strategizing how I\u2019m going to accomplish a task than I am doing the task itself. I\u2019ll sit down to do something and spend more time planning it than actually working on it. I really like to-do lists and breaking things down into smaller tasks, but sometimes I can get too focused on it and not focused enough on what I actually need to do.\n\n* **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nProfessionally, I\u2019m still working that out. I am pretty sure I want to go into law, but I don\u2019t know if I want to be a full-on lawyer or just a paralegal, or something similar. I also sometimes think about taking on/trying out other career paths, but I don\u2019t stress too much about it because I don\u2019t really feel the need to be some sort of bigshot or crazy rich person. I don\u2019t really care if I\u2019m in love with my career, and I definitely don\u2019t want to make it my whole life. I just don\u2019t want to hate it, and I want to be able to make enough money to live comfortably.\n\nPersonally, I want to improve myself. I don\u2019t really have a goal in mind, I just want to always try to improve myself at least a little bit as life goes on. Otherwise it\u2019s pretty simple: I want to have a home with my husband and one or two kids. I want to have enough money so that we don\u2019t have to worry about our next paycheck, and I don\u2019t really need or want much else.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI have a big fear of vomiting for some reason, which I have never really understood. The only thing I can think of is the fact that it\u2019s very unpleasant coupled with the fact that I can\u2019t control it if it\u2019s happening to me, once someone actually begins to vomit you can\u2019t stop it. I am also afraid of spiders and heights but those are much less severe. I also have a big fear of abandonment because of stuff that happened in my childhood, and that is very prevalent in my life unfortunately. It can make my anxiety act up pretty severely at times.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nI\u2019m usually very energetic or very relaxed. I\u2019m feeling good about myself and my relationships. I don\u2019t have any sort of work or difficult task coming up. I\u2019m feeling loved and warm!\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nHigh anxiety, low self esteem, low self confidence. I\u2019m thinking a lot of self-deprecating thoughts and generally experiencing bits of self-hatred. I have no motivation to even get out of bed and I can\u2019t stop crying. All of my responsibilities sort of fall away as well.\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI honestly daydream any chance I get. If I want to pass the time and can\u2019t access my phone for whatever reason I instantly start daydreaming. I daydream at work, when I\u2019m bored, when I\u2019m trying to sleep I think up fun scenarios in my head. I am capable of daydreaming and being aware of my surroundings if the daydream isn\u2019t deep enough, but more often than not I lose a lot of my awareness.\n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nHonestly probably the things I\u2019m going to want to do as soon as I get out. I would daydream about those things to pass the time.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI take a bit to make an important decision. I really want to be 100% sure of the decision I\u2019m going to make before I make it. Not only do I take the time to think it through, but I also often procrastinate even thinking about it. However, once I do make a decision, I don\u2019t change my mind. If I do, it\u2019s very rare.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?** \n\nI tend to be very in touch with my emotions because I\u2019m a very emotional person, sometimes to a fault. I\u2019m usually very aware of how I\u2019m feeling and why, and my feelings are usually strong and can change pretty quickly\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI only do that if I know it isn\u2019t worth arguing about. Like if I know someone is wrong about something trivial that I don\u2019t really care about, I\u2019ll pretend to be oblivious just because starting an argument isn\u2019t worth it in my eyes just to prove them wrong. Otherwise I usually state my opinions on things.\n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI feel like we need rules, but just because we need rules doesn\u2019t mean they all need to be followed, because some rules are dumb and some authority figures are dumb, but I do believe that the structure is needed or else the world would be too chaotic. However, I do have a tendency to comply to rules whether I agree with them or not, unless I know I can break them without getting caught (only in very mild circumstances like texting in class or something similar LOL). An exception would be a rule that goes strongly against my base morals or beliefs.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Note: I tested as so many types from ISTP, INFP, ENFJ to most recently ENTP. \n\n- Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m not very good at describing myself, and I always have to pause to think before answering. My initial answer was uuuuh, me? I don\u2019t really feel like I have a lot to say about myself other than I\u2019m a person currently on reddit.\n\n- Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNone. \n\n- Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nVery emotionally neglected I was a pretty sensitive child who wanted to share my feelings and inner world. I didn\u2019t get too because of a toxic mother who used to yell at me if I showed any emotion. I thought she was so immature as a kid, and I still think so now. I learned to shut up and move on. I don\u2019t really now how to express my feelings now either, not that I really want too. As for my Dad he was good not really emotionally loving either but at least he listened. I don\u2019t have much memories of my life so I can\u2019t add anymore. \n\nReligion. I liked it as a kid, doubted it as a teen and early adult. Now it feels completely foreign to me and I have zero interest in it. \n\n- What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nCurrently a student. History major and I like it after jumping around majors. I either want to be a history teacher or english teacher aboard. I also draw which I want to do as a side gig, and I\u2019m currently creating a visual novel. \n\n- If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI bounce between loving it, and then missing people. Most of the time I want space to my own. Though, I like having other people in my house around me just not talking to me haha. \n\n- What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nMostly indoor. Games, art, cooking, writing etc. I\u2019m neutral in sports they can be fun to play, but I don\u2019t go out of my way to play them. As a kid I liked to be active. \n\n- How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI\u2019m pretty curious. I like talking, and learning new things\u2014 until I don\u2019t then I get tired, and don\u2019t care. It tends to be around my hobbies or major, though I like learning random fun facts. My ideas are all centered around art or my future life. \n\n- Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo. Unless that means I do everything myself because I\u2019m a bit of a control freak. \n\n- Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI am somewhat? I trip over things often, but not as often as my INFP sibling. I don\u2019t really have much experiences with working with my hands, so maybe?! \n\n- Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nArtistic-ish. I just draw whatever I like and whatever will make me money. \n\n- What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n- past: something I don\u2019t really remember personally, but something that is important to society. If we don\u2019t remember our past then how do we move forward without repeating those mistakes. \n- Present: boring, but I have to do it. \n- Future: Where all my wants and wishes are. \n\n- How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI don\u2019t mind helping people and it doesn\u2019t bother me unless its something I CAN\u2019T do then I would want them to do ask someone else.  \n\n- Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n- I need things to make sense, so if that counts yes. \n\n- How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI imagine myself being very efficient, but I can never seem to do it.  \n\n- Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n- I don\u2019t think so. \n\n- What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n I am a visual and auditory learner. I did really well in classes with open discussions, I really loved doing those classes. If I class didn\u2019t have that then I found them boring. I tended to do well on classes if I felt like I could do them as well. \n\n- What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI do have some FOMO or getting murdered. \n\n- How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nAbout 50/50. I daydream pretty often. \n\n- How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI make them at a snap of a finger, regret it, need to talk about it, change my mind. Then rinse and repeat 20x until I actually make that decision. \n\n- How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t process them. Unless randomly getting hit with them right before bed. \n\n- Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don\u2019t break rules, but I find an easier way to do something I\u2019ll do it. Yes if they\u2019re being idiots then its fair game. They don\u2019t always know better but I don\u2019t disrespect them either.", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "&#x200B;\n\n* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nIm 23, male from Europe, not very tall and slim (my metabolism be fast af), generally lazy and trying to enjoy life. I wear mostly black clothes and jeans and used to paint my nails black because I'm emo/goth lol.\n\n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo, but I feel like I might have ADHD since I always fidget with random stuff and I was also severely depressed (borderline suicidal) when I was 16 but haven't had those thoughts since then.\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was kind of erratic in the sense that my parents didn't really have much time for me and when I was very young I had abandonment issues and would cry in the kindergarten because the kids were mostly annoying. My grandma would take me to a local internet cafe where I would spend my time playing video games aside from watching cartoons. She also took me to church a couple times when I was a kid but I would just play with the other kids and there were also toys on the first floor, I never really understood it and I feel like I've always been an atheist. \n\nMy parents are very odd type of people - my father lives in the past and when I was little, we would just watch the same movies and stuff over and over but eventually I grew out of that and I look for something novel, for example I can't watch the same movies more than 1-2 times.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI graduated computer science this year and currently work as a junior software developer in the DevOps field and I do like it though my impostor syndrome kicks off quite a lot. Yesterday we started working on a project and I was the main dude working on the terminal and had the other 3 developers whine about every little error I make or that I'm being \"too fast\" to write stuff as if I have 0 clue what I'm doing, it kind of felt like I'm taking a technical interview. Other than that it's pretty chill, people are mostly nice except my manager. I won a hackathon that was hosted by the university and he decided that he would assign me to a project that's beyond my capabilities so there's high expectations. I just hope I don't burn out or I get fired for the time being, since I'm still a newcomer.\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel refreshed for sure. I just clock out at 6pm from work and do my stuff, maybe cook something or watch anime and talk to my girlfriend and maybe play some games then go sleep. It does get lonely since I don't have a lot of friends but my girlfriend and my best friend make up for it, for the most part. \n\n* **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI wouldn't say I'm good at sports, though I did enjoy playing basketball at high school and university. I also used to be somewhat decent as a goalkeeper in high school but only for the P.E. classes, nothing beyond that. I never wanted to go to a competition or whatever. However I've always wanted to do some kind of martials arts like muay thai but I never took the chance to since I get lazy very easily and I feel it it would drain me mentally even more. I used to get in fights in high school with friends but I'm not really the violent type since everything can be resolved by using words, e.g diplomatically. I see violence as a final resort, in general.\n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nAlthough I see myself as a curious person, I tend to filter some information nowadays that simply does not interest me, such as news or fashion or whatever it may be, if I'm interested in it, I will research as much as I want/will. I do have a lot of ideas/theories but those are more correlated to like conspiracies or unpopular opinions. I feel like most people have no ability to think for themselves and just become sheep just to appeal to society's standards. \n\nI'm curious about history, astronomy/space, tech, video games, scenarios that could or may not happen like \"what if\" scenarios. I space out quite a lot when I'm watching anime or doing whatever, I get lost in thought easily. \n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI think I would take a leadership position if there's no one else to take the initiative but normally if there's someone that is already knowledgeable and worthy to be a leader, I'd follow him. I wouldn't want to be a leader for as long as if I have to. I feel like my leadership style would be to reach the objective we've set. When I was in university I hated project assignments because I would have to manage everything usually and I'd rather just do it myself at that point. If I can do it on my own then I'm gonna do it on my own.\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not really coordinated, sometimes when I'm outside and thinking about stuff I zone out and I trip on the street or when I'm at home I often times eat while I'm moving back and forth because I'm thinking about something, I forget my surroundings a lot. One time I had to run an errand for my mother and I couldn't find my wallet even though I looked pretty much everywhere that I could think of and then once I went to the store with the jacket I normally wore at the time it was apparently in my pocket the entire time...Also when I forget stuff like if I forget where my phone or keys are I try to rewind to where I went or what I did most recently and track my actions to find where something is. I don't really enjoy working with my hands because I am anxious and stability is not one of my core strengths which is probably why I would never be a photographer or something.\n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI used to draw when I was younger and I was somewhat good at it but I never really saw it something \"deep\" or impressive. I just drew whatever I could picture that would look cool but I find art, especially nowadays to be ambiguous as in modern art is not really art-art. I mean c'mon, a banana taped to a wall is art now? Or hell those artists that spin around a bucket over a canvas and call it a day...yeah no. I like Salvador Dali because his art is not visually appealing to the eye but I also find it abstract.\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe Past: I try not to look into the past often unless it's for nostalgia reasons, I associate it with troubles or mistakes or whatever in that regard otherwise. When I think of the past in general I see it as what has shaped me into the person that I currently am and try not to dwell too much on it since it's already gone and it doesn't help me at all.\n\nThe Present: I see it as the opportunities that I can either seize or choose not to. Everything is constantly changing and it makes me excited for new things to have because everyday is something novel especially since I work in tech. But not only that, people/news/articles and everything change right by second so it's constant and sometimes I find it exhausting if anything.\n\nThe Future: It changes depends on how I feel, however for the most part I see it as a dystopia, even though some parts may be good about it. For example, in the future most stuff we do or that people used to do will be automated by machines, one way or another. Which would lead to a larger recession that we currently have, however the mentality of people might also change to make them strive to do better instead of relying on robots to do everything for them. I get FOMO a lot, especially about space, things that I would never witness, such as Andromeda colliding with our universe or Mount Rushmore ceasing to exist or whatever. There's a reason why I used to watch Vsauce so much, not because of the great information he delivers but also because the topics were very interesting even if one could not experience them thoroughly. For me personally, I want to become an expert in my field and hopefully have a family, visit some countries, etc. I have always wanted to visit Egypt and Japan and it's part of my many dreams.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIt depends on what they're asking me to do and who is asking me to do it. If it's at work obviously I will do it but depending on whether it's a friend or not I could just say \"nah\" or \"idk im too busy\" but then if they try to still force it upon me I might slack off on purpose or just forget to do it. If I decide to help someone I would do it because I deem them important and it also depends again on what \"help\" is meant, it could mean anything. I love helping with providing information but I try not to get physical when I have to or with advice.\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nBeing logical is what I try to do most of the time, though I second guess myself a lot because one solution could always be worse/better than another solution later on. What I mean is, one shouldn't immediately call it a day once a solution has been found, unless there's no other solution to be thought of. I try to be practical with my decisions, even though sometimes I buy stuff that I don't necessarily need but I still get them because they give me a sense of thrill.\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI try to be productive and I don't like postponing or delaying too much because it makes me very anxious as in that I won't be able to do it in time. If I can do it early and have it gone out of my head then that's great. I don't want to be seen as incompetent so I strive to learn as much as I can and apply it in practice where possible.\n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI wouldn't say I control others but I may or may not have indirectly manipulated someone without me knowing. I'm not really a bossy type though, if I can do something then I'll do it myself. I wouldn't really ask someone to run an errand for me unless I have a medical problem or idk.\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy hobbies are playing video games, listening to music, watching anime/vids. I like them because they make me relax and I don't have to think as much or at all when doing them, unless I'm playing a tactical shooter or a strategy game, such as chess or w/e. I loved metal construction sets as a kid and tinkering with random stuff, because every new thing I haven't touched before was interesting to me.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI'm mostly a visual learner using logic and memory, kind of, though mostly for things I'm genuinely interested in. I learn by doing and by seeing stuff and memorizing a ton of details and the likes is not one of my core strengths. I could remember stuff from years ago that actually interested me, such as a random fact/equation/quote, etc. but stuff that I dislike and didn't find enjoyable doesn't stick with me.\n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nNo, I don't strategize I just go with the flow and see what happens, I don't plan because that drains me mentally and if I could get by without planning I will. I would definitely say I wing projects and improvise, well I improvise at whatever I can, actually.\n\n* **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nAs I mentioned before, I want to become a professional in my field of work and personally I just want to enjoy life and experience new things before it I'm gone.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI have FOMO (as mentioned) and being alone, I guess. People that are too touchy make me uncomfortable, people that talk too loud around me, people initiating conversations with me without me knowing them. I hate idiots, people that can't think for themselves, loud people, smartasses, normies, arguing for the sake of arguing, in fact I avoid arguments whenever I can. Well, I hate them simply because I cannot get along with them easily, most of my friends are people that understand me quite easily and I tend to filter people based on that.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nBeing able to say whatever I want without having to censor myself, having fun, talking about my interests, doing my hobbies, learning new stuff, etc.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nAnxiety, low self esteem, impostor syndrome. Sometimes I have no motivation to brush my teeth or I tend to oversleep / not sleep enough. I also become anxious about the future, I get thoughts, what if I get fired, what if then this that and I spiral but not for long periods of time, but it happens. I have frequent mood swings and normally I just got the bitch resting face.\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI don't really daydream much but when I do I don't pay attention to my surroundings and I just go \"uh?\" or \"sorry i spaced out\", I am not aware of my surroundings and even with simple tasks like taking out the trash I would keep going straight while I'm thinking and would have to remind myself that the garbage bin I skipped while I'm moving and I appear like an idiot.\n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI would look for a way to escape because I'm not staying in an empty room for more than an hour or so, I would get claustrophobic eventually and would instinctively attempt to break out on my own. Having no one to talk to or nothing to do is one the things I hate.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI consider all the possibilities of that option that I choose. It works kind of like the butterfly effect, like if I take option A1 it could lead to B1 then C1 then D1 and if I take option A2 it could lead to B1 C2 and something like that, I try to look for that option that correlates with what I want to achieve and more often than not I roll with it even though I'm never 100% sure about it. I do change my mind a lot since I might find a better option than the former later on.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI don't really understand my emotions and usually I feel like a robot because I don't get strong feelings at all. The emotional stances are like laughter, crying and the usual blank face. I find my emotions annoying and tend to ignore them and bottle them up whenever I can, until they explode on me.\n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNo, I don't see why I should agree with someone just to make them feel better. If I am 99% sure I am right about something and I've thought it in my head I wouldn't mind escalating it into a debate to see their POV, because there be a 1% chance that I could be wrong. I look for logical inconsistencies in people's points and arguments and I am quick to point them out, then they get upset. \n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't break rules often solely because I want to have a peaceful life, in fact being in jail is one of the things that I fear and I hope never happens to me. I would say authority as a whole is complex topic to talk about because society as we have it, can never be perfect no matter what the circumstances are. People will always abuse their power and there's always going to be people to break rules, and that's probably why life is fun in that sense, if everyone abided by the rules and people didn't abuse their power, the world would be dull. Some people would do go to the extremes to commit a crime, just to seem cool. On the other hand, some people get an authority position just to accumulate more wealth and just life off telling people lies. I have broken rules as well but it hasn't hurt anyone so it shouldn't be a big deal, though I don't break them often if at all, in reality.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I got my results as an INTJ but idk...\n\n\nI am really really lazy but when I need to finish something I work my ass off the whole day just before the deadline and finish the thing and get decent results(not perfect scores like a typical INTJ would get , I usually get about 80% in my report cards ) . \n\nI'm not very decisive in fact I'm very indecisive unlike an INTJ . I also have very bad anxiety and I can't breath in crowded spaces. \n\nI'm very loud and talkative when I'm with closed ones but yeah I have the poker face in front of others.

{"submission": "How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m an 18 year old girl. I have split dyed hair, and tend to dress in either a feminine alternative/emo style OR like a little boy(graphic t shirts and basketball shorts i take from my brother)\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI\u2019m autistic. I grew up undiagnosed(as a lot of people do) and it definitely shaped my childhood and psychological makeup as a whole. Related- I have also struggled with an eating disorder and self harm, but I see those as symptoms of the bigger issue rather than the cause. \n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI grew up in a fairly normal family, with a twin brother. He had some difficulties in childhood, ironically he was diagnosed with autism a lot earlier than I was and he was mostly nonverbal and showed developmental delays. In comparison, I was labeled \u201cgifted\u201d and performed well academically, which I think contributed to my not getting diagnosed. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI do not have a job currently but my DREAM is to work at a game company, as a 3D modeler or a concept artist. Preferably with characters, I find backgrounds/props a little boring. \n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nThat is the ideal weekend for me!! I love to spend time on my own :) I rarely get lonely unless I\u2019m already feeling down and the solitude stops being comforting.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI love to draw, write, read, play video games, watch my favorite shows(mostly cartoons), listen to music, and exercise! I\u2019ve been getting into running lately, and I have a black belt in taekwondo. I don\u2019t like team sports very much and never did them as a kid.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI have a TON of ideas. I often find myself wishing for more hours in the day and more mental energy to sustain it because I just have a lot of things I\u2019d like to do, all the time. I have multiple \u201cuniverses\u201d with stories in my head, as well as unnamed or unhoused characters that need development. I always have a catalogue of things I\u2019d like to create running in the back of my mind. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI think I\u2019d be good at it but I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. I grew into being really proficient at reading people and analyzing group dynamics, as well as \u201cplaying\u201d certain archetypes. I think I would be able to lead a group and adapt to the person they needed me in order to be the most productive/effective but I would find it exhausting.\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nPhysically? I think I\u2019m average- I\u2019ve definitely had some blunders but I\u2019m not extraordinarily clumsy. I like working with my hands, as I love to draw and paint.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

means passion and desire which I also lack n I have no passion or desire to live That's enough of colores don't you think so...so what's next oh let's go whit some random facts about my personality shall we -i have an existing crisis and a middle age Criss every day -i am sensitive but I tried to look strong to people -i daydream a lot then I over think the way I daydream -as I said before I

demi Lovato Fight song  Brave by Sara Bohemian rhapsody  Shake it off Based on my last research am an infj 4w5 Maybe it feel weird to say that I have the rarest personality type In other words I don't actually know who I am so I write staf like this to try at least no very little about myself for example for the longest time I thought I wasn't judgement but now I guess I am a little I am open minded for people who just life their life's and I love it for them but when people put their nose in some one else business I got mad easily and I want to argue whit that person to stop it I used to think I am not a people pleaser but turned out I am for example I can give up my right for some stranger to avoid problems but not other people rights  Things like that help me understand that I know a little about myself apparently I can read people easily but can't read myself  ", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "**Enneagram:** Considered type 4 and 6. \n\n**Instinctual Variant:** SP/SX\n\n**My Main Focus in Life is Self-Expression:** \n\nDecorating my environment to suit a specific aesthetic including what I wear. \n\nI find joy in customization, defining and communicating my identity. \n\nIt can be a way of saying, \u201cThis is who I am\u201d or \u201cThis is what I value\u201d. \n\nSelf-expression can boost my self confidence, feeling good in what I\u2019m wearing or how I\u2019ve decorated my space. It\u2019s a source of comfort.\n\nSometimes, my emotions and feelings can be challenging to express verbally. Fashion and decor can become a non-verbal means of conveying my emotions or moods.\n\nFor me, the act of creating or customizing items can have therapeutic benefits. It can be a way to relax, relieve stress, and focus on something positive and enjoyable.\n\nI appreciate the beauty in different materials, colors, and designs, which can bring joy and satisfaction.\n\n**Core Desires:** \n\nTo be cherished, having support, empathy and guidance.  \n(Secondarily, validation, fulfillment, self-expression, mastery and self-development). \n\n**Core Fears:**\n\nBeing disliked, hated, outcasted and judged (negative perception).  \n\nBeing helpless, without support, guidance, inadequacy and rejection (Isolation and vulnerability).\n\n**Stance:** \n\nI want to do things well, I depend on others for feedback, my orientation is on the present and concerned with \"what needs to be done now\". Anxious of what is coming up in the near future and wants it over with.\n\n**Response:**\n\nFear, confusion, anxiety, and concern with protection. \n\nAnxiety and safety is a huge thing for me, I'm typically anxious by default. I will prep for disasters.\n\nQuick in anger and panic, move to action.\n\nI do not feel that I can defend myself through words adequately and end up having a bad mental episode.\n\n**Skills:**\n\nI am quite artistic but generally not creative in coming up with ideas or solutions. I do better with using past experiences to tackle problems. Funny enough my skill in problem-solving comes down to needing a vast amount of experience to feed into my storage of knowledge to work with factors to solve \"creatively\". I rely on google a lot and ask others for help when tackling unique situations.\n\nWithout having a vast amount of skills in anything I can feel completely worthless and depressed. My happiness banks on my ability to learn new skills and improvement. \n\nThis can be anything like becoming a master in anything artful such as drawing, sewing, sculpting, music, etc. This can be learning a new language or advancing in the chosen language. This could be mastering physics and expanding knowledge in scientific fields. Etc. Not to be confused with failing at success, I don't need to be successful. I feel fulfilled simply by having a skill(s). It brings peace and confidence within me. Competency provides confidence and something to share passionately.  \n\n**Communicating with Others:**\n\nI'm a soft-spoken individual who can be described as socially shy, sensitive, reserved and introverted. When giving my opinion on something to someone my foremost thoughts are usually subjective \u201cDo I like it?\u201d etc. Although\u2026I like to answer quite objectively, honestly and with constructive criticism. While criticism is tough, I value honesty.\n\nIt's kind of awkward for me when I'm around people who are really emotional, and I'm not always sure what to say to make things better.\n\nI tend to concentrate on my own concerns, and sometimes my lack of interest in others can make me feel like I might come across as self-centered. \n\nI seek security and comfort in my connections with others and tend to be anxious about personal safety and safety of those close to me.\n\nI also struggle with lying and instead if I\u2019m asked something I don't feel comfortable giving a straight (negative or personal) response to... I will stay quiet and cannot bring myself to speak, it's like I lost the ability to speak.\n\nWhen it comes to leadership roles, I don't find them appealing; they feel restrictive and confining.\n\n**Focus:**\n\nI am typically present-focused. I just don't like to think about the past and or future. Present entertainment and pleasures are what I indulge in.\n\nI am the type to stress about upcoming events until it passes. If there is a deadline then until I complete the thing I will be in a stressed state. I'm also someone who prefers play over work. I struggle to focus and have a hard time tackling tasks but I try to do tasks in intervals. I will work out how many pages of a book per day I have to read to reach a deadline for example but some days I don't feel up to it so ill recalculate and simply adjust the general plan to reach my goal in time.\n\n**Other:**  \nI favor familiarity, change is best when it's my choice. I\u2019m prone to depression, glass is half-empty. I\u2019m open to new experiences aligned with my interests. I value freedom. I prioritize both expressing myself authentically, achieving competence in my endeavors and a need for stability in my life. I have a love for nature and animals.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I think I'm most probably INTJ. Every test I've taken has said INTJ or sometimes INFP or INTP, but I'm still not sure. I've also considered that I could be ENFP, ENTP or even INFJ. Can you guys help me please?\n\n\u2022\t**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\n23, Male, grew up in South Africa, living in Australia. I am a bright, optimistic, and cheerful person. I'm addicted to learning, I have a good sense of humour and love laughing. I love nature, bright colours, and anything that's unusual or out-of-the-box. Despite that, I also love dark and intense music, art, and literature. I adore classical music, especially Gustav Mahler, he's my absolute favourite, and I've recently been getting into progressive metal. I play numerous instruments, but the Violin is my favourite.  \nI love dark, tragic stories that explore deep concepts. My favourite book/movie is The Plague Dogs. I also love Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Quintin Tarantino (love/hate), and Hayao Miyazaki. Mononoke Hime is also one of my favourite movies.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI have ADHD-PI. \n\n\u2022\t**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nI was homeschooled from the age of 7. My mom (ENFJ) is very spiritual, but not religious. She loves Law of Attraction sort of stuff, which I don't believe in. This occasionally causes a bit of conflict between us. I'm not religious at all.  \nMy father (ISFP) was physically abusive to me and would constantly fight with my mom. They divorced when was 10. My life was very free after that, no school, no fucked-up father, I loved it. I was free to create and be myself.\n\n\u2022\t**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI dream of this all the time. It would be fantastic!\n\n\u2022 \t**What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good  at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI'm not a fan of sports. I love walking and being out in nature. Walking helps me think and stay connected to myself. I don't really do any other physical activities\n\n\u2022 \t**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What  are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am extremely curious about the natural world. Particularly botany and meteorology. I'm also obsessed by the etymology of words. I love linguistics and learning new languages.  \nI also love philosophy and like to explore and understand many different worldviews  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I hate telling others what to do. And at the same time, I hate being part of a team and I can't stand it when people tell me what to do. I'm very independent.\n\n\u2022 \t**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you  enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI enjoy working with my hands, and I'm quite good at it. However I am extremely clumsy and unaware of the world around me,\n\n\u2022 \t**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular  artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of  art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI'm extremely artistic. I paint and write music, and play numerous instruments. Art is how I connect to my inner soul. My paintings and music are highly symbolic and generally represent philosophical concepts that concern me at that time. I use art to bring these concepts to life in a physical medium which I feel allows me to understand them better.\n\n\u2022\t**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past is history, the future's a mystery, and the present is a gift. That being said, I struggle to live in the now, and tend to worry about the future quite a lot. I kind of live in a 'psuedo-now' state, where I'm living in the present, but in my head, and I'm aware of my thoughts as if they were physical objects. Almost everything I do is done in order to make a future plan happen. I never really think about the past. I actually have a terrible long and short term memory, so the past is a place I can never really visit, even if I wanted to.\n\n\u2022 \t**How do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI'd feel a bit annoyed, and would rather they didn't ask me. If I were to help them, I would try to get their problem solved as quickly as possible so that I can get back to my own life. I would also try to solve their problem thoroughly and carefully so that it won't happen again.\n\n\u2022\t**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI only do things that make sense. If it doesn't make sense, or is illogical, I struggle to get it done.\n\n\u2022\t**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI try to do everything as quickly, smoothly, and efficiently as possible. My Grandmother (ISFJ) loves all gimmicky gadgets often gets angry when I don't use them. I can't stand it. I hate anything impractical.\n\n\u2022\t**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI have often been accused of being manipulative. I genuinely don't do it on purpose, I just tend to come across that way. I sometimes try and persuade people to do things that will benefit me (and them too, I'm not evil) by showing them evidence that it will help them.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nLike I said before, I love music, art poetry, linguistics, climatology, botany, and philosophy. I see them more as tools to help me understand the world around me.\n\n\u2022 \t**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you  struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?**\n\nLogic and creativity. I'm not good at memorizing things, and I'm not in tune with my senses.\n\n\u2022\t**How good  are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable  tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you  go?**\n\nI try and construct a plan and stick to it, but I often end by improvising as I go along, because there was something that I didn't take into account.\n\n\u2022\t**What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nNone. I don't aspire for anything. I have no real world goals. I only want to understand myself, create art, and appreciate the natural world. That's it.\n\n\u2022\t**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI'm afraid of not doing the right thing. Whether it's writing an excel spreadsheet, or making important decisions. I'm terrified that I might do the wrong thing and regret it and mess things up forever.\n\n\u2022\t**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nProductive, creative, maybe a little bit impulsive, SOOO many ideas. This is when I usually start/finish all my projects.\n\n\u2022\t**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nNumb, depressed, apathetic. I struggle to get things done. I can stare out of the window for hours and think about life.\n\n\u2022 \t**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of  your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI'm permanently daydreaming. I can't control myself, and it actually has a negatively affect on my life.  \nI'm almost never aware of what's going on around me. I frequently knock things over, bump into things, misplace things, and make silly mistakes here and there.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI'm not too sure. My thoughts are random and usually not based on my surroundings. Sometimes I might see something that reminds me of something else, and then uncontrollably I zone out into a daydream state. \n\n\u2022\t**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI struggle to make decisions. As I mentioned before, I have a fear of doing the wrong thing, so it takes me a long to to decide what I should do.   \nI almost always change my mind once I've made a decision.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI'm quite good with my emotions. They are complex and colourful, I love experiencing them. My emotions are very personal to me, I don't like to show them to anyone, and certainly don't make them anyone else's problem.  \nWhen I feel them, I analyze them and try to work out their meanings. I perceive my emotions like [this](https://youtu.be/8iWmzp7EPPw?si=kDdEr4ptWHpCi1wh&t=55). However, I do have the ability to put my emotions on hold. Let's say that I'm currently feeling sad, and there is something I need to do, I just stop being sad for a moment, do thing, and then go back to being sad again. I try to never let my emotions influence my actions, but sometimes I get a bit carried away, and may raise my voice and say/do something stupid that I end up regretting later.  \n\n\n\u2022\t**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI do this frequently. I don't want to start any drama, so I just pretend to agree with them, even when I don't share their views. However there are a few people (close friends) that I'm not afraid to disagree with. I actually love debating.\n\n\u2022\t**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI have my own set of rules that I seldom break. I don't care about anyone else's rules, and I don't expect anyone to care about mine. I do my own thing, in my own way.   \nI would never do anything to harm someone, but I see nothing wrong with breaking a rule that doesn't make any sense. No one knows what's best for anyone but themselves, so no one has the authority to tell anyone else what to do or how they should live.  \nYes, authority should be challenged as often as possible. I see no one as superior or inferior. No Gods, No Masters is my motto.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks guys.  \n", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I need help figuring out my type. Im def Ne-Si but idk if Im Ti-Fe or Fi-Te.

I\u2019m AuDHD so I do some stuff that may be weird and useless but for me, it makes sense (ex: hitting myself on my right arm if my left gets hit so its equal). If someone wants to teach me something I dont consider useful for my futur (unless I\u2019m really into that, unlike most school subjects), I\u2019m not gonna force myself to work on that because I deem it as a waste of my time. I consider myself different from others in the ways I learn (traditional school doesn\u2019t work), so I hate when people impose their ways on me without letting me do it the way it works for me.\n\nI\u2019m really bad at figuring out how I feel and expressing myself authentically (and when I succeed, I feel cringe asf). Its easier to express things I\u2019m not actually feeling , like deep affection. My morals never really stay consistant. They often change depending on my mood, how I\u2019m feel, who I\u2019m with ect. Im very flexible in what is right or wrong because I think in terms of morality, everything is a shade of grey, there\u2019s no black and white. I rarely hold grudges but when I do, it can last a very long time. I love figuring out other people\u2019s emotions and tend to provoke others to get reactions our of them for fun (good and bad).

I'm not all that bossy, I don't care about micromanaging others and I am certainly not a workaholic. On the surface I seem to appear like a lot of ENTJ characters along with a lot of ENTPs mixed in there *(I am 97% sure I don't have Ni-Se though.)* I have a relatively weak sense of self which makes it difficult to evaluate on an objective level. To add to the confusion I suffer from ADHD and went unmedicated for my entire life until recently which was definitely what made me believe I was ENTP before. My close friends and confidants disagree between ESTJ and ENTP, so I know it's not just me. So to sum up, the main issue is that I seem very ENTP at times, but I believe my Si is too strong to be inferior, in fact I would consider it one of my strongest functions. I'm unsure whether I use Ti or Te, I'm heavily leaning on Te though. So if you've got time, read through the bullet points below, ask me some questions if you'd like and let me know what you think.\n\n# Bullet points\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  I enjoy daydreaming while walking or falling asleep, I will seldom let myself do it if there's something I should rather be doing it. So it's often kept to walks and as a way of falling asleep.  \n\n*  I wouldn't consider myself widely innovative or original, often \"my ideas\" are just my own spin on something I've seen before. My projects often end up being HEAVILY inspired by what I've enjoyed before. I enjoy writing stories in private, a lot of my ideas and plot points are taken from fiction I've enjoyed myself with a few added elements to make sure it's not a copy-paste. In short, they essentially end up being kind of predictable and generic plot-wise, but with good characters and good dialogue to make up for it.  \n\n*  If something isn't going to be reliable long-term, I will attempt to make it reliable, if I can't I'll feel compelled to find something else.  \n\n*  I don't crave novelty and I don't really crave any form of excitement, I'm the happiest at home working on my own projects and improving on them. When I do go out in my free time it'll be to maintain friendships and not out of any desire to have fun.  \n\n*  On the subject of friendships, I have few people I consider close friends. I am bad at keeping friendships due to me having no inherent desire to spend time with people that aren't my girlfriend. This doesn't mean I don't value friends, I'm loyal to the core and will always be available if one of them needs help. I am just bad at setting time aside to have fun with them  \n\n*  I am often frustrated with interruptions to my leisure time, I often consider leisure time to be sacred. I often spend it with my girlfriend, but if it's not with her, I will mostly be alone. If something comes up while I'm relaxing I will get cranky.  \n\n*  I am quite opinionated politically, I don't go looking for debates, but I will assert my opinion if I disagree with someone. My political views are often very grounded, and I will often reject views I see as heavily idealistic or realistically impractical to implement.  \n\n* I have ADHD, which obviously makes me distractable, excitable and scattered. Taking meds makes me a lot less so, I had difficulty studying beforehand, I had a strong desire to since I hated the feeling of being behind, it made me feel incredibly insecure and made me doubt my own intellect. Since I started my meds I find studying easier and a lot less tedious. I've made it a habit to study at least an hour everyday. I usually meet that hour, but rarely go over it.  \n\n*  My room is often messy, I usually peg this on ADHD though I am still often a bit ashamed to admit it. I will often have a cluttered desk and clothes spread around the floor for easy access when I wake up. This goes on for a few weeks till I feel claustrophobic and disgusted by the mess and spend an hour or so cleaning.  \n\n*  In school (college and trade school as an electrician) I would dislike doing things without knowing precisely what I was doing was correct or incorrect. Often I'd be the annoying one who'd go up to the teacher and go \"Just so I'm fully certain, I am supposed to do x, then y using z?\" if I was unsure and the teacher wasn't available I'd often get stuck and wait for the teacher. Essentially, I dislike starting on something without being fully certain if I'm wasting my time or not  \n\n*  I don't know how relevant this is, but I often use the words \"In my experience\"  \n\n*  I enjoy the process of researching a topic, usually it'll be something related to what I'm doing. But occasionally I'll ask myself \"How intelligent are birds?\" and look it up, I don't bounce from topic to topic like some people though, I often keep it to just that.  \n\n*  I don't consider myself a workaholic, in fact I consider myself to be quite lazy. At school and at work, I shoot for precisely the amount of work that's expected, what you ask for is what you get, no more, no less. This is one of the primary reasons I'm uncertain whether or not I'm ESTJ. I enjoy improving things, but on my own terms, I don't feel a compulsive need to go above and beyond, unless I am personally interested. I seek to improve and maximize the effectiveness of my hobbies, learning to write better, and playing more optimally (videogames), I don't necessarily think about \"How can I make this process more enjoyable\", if what I'm doing makes me better I'll likely enjoy it more.  \n\n*  I don't take things too seriously compared to the average ESTJ. I will often laugh off mistakes unless something was properly fucked up. but on the other hand, I am definitely more serious than an average ENTP  \n\n*  I can often see the validity of other people's viewpoints even if I disagree. For example socialism vs capitalism. I can see why a socialist would prefer socialism as well as the benefits of socialism on paper, but to me, it has proven to be unreliable and impractical.  \n\n*  I am at times up in my head and slightly absent-minded.  \n\n*  I will often do things the same way over and over, unless a better method shows up, though I'll often reject it in the start. In a way I am quite contrarian, if I have my way of doing it or looking at it I will stubbornly stick to it. Whenever I do change up my methods it's usually a result of someone pointing out to me how it's way better, in a way makes it make sense for me. For example, my phone didn't have a plug thingy for earbuds, so if I wanted to listen to music in cars or in public, I'd put the volume all the way down and take the phone up to my ear. One day my mom got sick of it and gave me her AirPods, this was years after they became popular. Only after using them then did I change.  \n\n*  I am open to new ways of doing things if it's not forced on me. We're working together and you wanna take a creative new approach to your part? Go for it, if it works I don't care in the slightest how you get it done, as long as it is done.  \n\n*  I struggle with deadlines, often having trouble meeting them, ADHD might come into play. I will often have full intention to do it when I say \"I'll do it later\" but I'll end up forgetting. It's not necessarily a procrastination tactic but more like me not having the means to do it in the moment and forgetting to do it when I have the means to do it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI might make this in video form at a later date if I don't reach full certainty, I believe it could be easier get more insight through body language. Most of my \"ENTPness\" seems to sit in my tone and body language. Anywho, please ask away if you've got any questions. I will be very grateful to anyone who takes the time to lend me a hand.\n\n ", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": " ISTJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": " \n\n* **Give us a general description of yourself.**  \n\\- Male. I like games, playing some sports, a bit of anime. I like reading aswell although i haven't done it in awhile but i want to again soon. \n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**  \n\\- I have OCD for a few years now. Still struggling but it is what it is. \n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**  \n\\- It was sort of tough but also not brutally bad. It was tough because of family just being assholes and secretly doing sketchy stuff to eachother. So i had times where it was cool, but some times were a bit icky. But all around, i can't complain. It def had a religious upbringing, but i wouldn't say it was done well to be honest. I am still religious tho.   \n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**  \n\\- It depends on the week i had and my mood, sometimes i would like it. Other times tho, i may want to hang out with others so its 50/50.  \n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**  \n\\- As i mentioned, i do like some sports. But i am mostly just staying at home.  \n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**  \n\\- Quite curious, even about little/trivial things. Some random thing may pop up and i will search it up because i want to know. But not only randomly curious, i just like to know things, learn. I also like to be sure by knowing more or as much as possible.   \n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**  \n\\- Depends, i can be a good leader, but not in ALL things. And i may not take the position right from the start. I may do it if i am confident, or when i need to (otherwise others will fuck it up).   \n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**  \n\\- Nah, to be honest i am clumsy as fuck. I am aware of my surroundings, but not \"fully\"? When i am seriously observing my surroundings, i am not clumsy. But when i am just doing basic things, i forget that i left the door handle above my head open so i chuck my head to it for example, stuff like that. I am focused on something and because of that, i forget about the other because i am so busy in my head.   \n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**  \n\\- I like some paintings, but i am NOT artisctic at all myself. I can appreciate nice paintings tho (mostly some landscape or sky).  \n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**  \n\\- All 3 affect me, but present the least i think? past (nostalgia, cringey memories etc.) present (?) future (possibilities, thinking ahead, anxiety, big picture etc.)  \n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**  \n\\- 99% i don't mind and help so, cause why not? But if you are a bitch to me or something and you ask for help, i may or may not help you. But i will be annoyed if you abuse asking for help or when i need to do something myself aswell and you keep asking.   \n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**  \n\\- Yes  \n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**  \n\\- Pretty important  \n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**  \n\\- I may do it with a few family members, but not in a negative way (try to guide them into not doing stupid shit and stuff). Because i don't want them to not know what to do or letting them do stupid stuff when i could have told them earlier aswell.   \n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**  \n\\- Already mentioned it. Sports, because its fun and healthy (nice physcial activity). Gaming is fun aswell (more mental) and Anime and reading are just entertainment. Books may be non-fiction aswell about things i could learn so there's that.   \n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**  \n\\- It needs to be clear. Don't be vague, be clear and just explain. Don't overtalk and yap, and not too short either. Just medium. I want learn by theory and practice. Theory is not needed 100%, but it will help ALOT since i feel more confident because i feel more prepared. Also logic is a huge factor, if its not logical, it won't get through and it will be gone in 5 minutes. And i like having the ability to ask for help if i need it.   \n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**  \n\\- I can be decent at it. I don't really only improvise and go, since you will forget stuff and then mess up, all that shit.   \n\n* **What's important to you and why?**  \n\\- Being successful. That's my life goal and that is what i want to do. Make some family members proud aswell.   \n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**  \n\\- Bugs, Heights, OCD thoughts. Speaks for itself.   \n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**  \n\\- Things going well, being in a good mood and just generally things being positive.   \n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**  \n\\- Bad mood, things are not going well, etc etc.   \n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**  \n\\- Depends, 50/50. I can be a heavy daydreamer, but i can also pay attention. If i daydream, i mostly am aware of my surroundings. But if i am REALLY dreaming, which i sometimes do, i am lost for a quick moment.   \n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**  \n\\- Thinking why the fuck i am in that room and how to get out or what i can do.   \n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**  \n\\- Depends on what the decision is for, sometimes i can be easy, sometimes not. And i can change my mind pretty often.   \n\n* **How important are emotions in your life?**  \n\\- \"important\"? don't know. but i do have to do alot with them tho. i am a bit of an emotional person.   \n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**  \n\\- Sometimes, maybe if i want to stretch time or other reasons.   \n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**  \n\\- Sometimes, if the rules are stupid and hindering then i can give 0 fucks. If authority acts like they're everything, go fuck yourself. Other than that, i will be respectful at default. If the authority is nice and chill, then all is good. \n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**  \n\\- Being successfull, being stable, things are going well etc. ", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

I want everything to be fair, to a point it's unrealistic, but I can't help it. \n\n- I have great unbiased, rational thinking, but also strong emotions that tend to show up usually when something isn't the way I'm used to it or when I feel like I've failed, and then these emotions mess up everything. I can't control it too well at home. At school I'm better, but when I was young, it was also a disaster. My emotions usually show as anger. \n\n- I hate change. I can't put up with it. I don't even know why I hate it. \n\n- I want to plan everything, but I don't know how to plan. \n\n- I have a scattered imagination.

{"submission": "Hello all, I\u2019ve taken multiple MBTI tests and have gotten mixed results and was looking for some insight into my type. My interests include video games, reading, studying, and hanging out with friends. I notice in one on ones I excel socially but in groups I remain silent. I love helping people and want to see growth in human individuals. I resonate a lot in particularly with INFJ, ENFP, and ENTP but I struggle to decipher between those three. I feel I have a very analytical mind but my emotions toward navigating the social arena stifle me and prevent me from projecting my true, more blunt thoughts. I tend to procrastinate because I fear that my work will not be good enough due to perfectionist tendencies. I tend to jump from topic to topic in order to keep a conversation with others fresh. I therefore exhibit a lot of Ne and Ti while also being a highly emotional person. I find it difficult to deduce that I\u2019m a thinker given how often I prioritize feelings so I tend to lean toward ENFP but I feel I have little to no Fi. I fair decently socially, with many people saying that one of the best things about me is how I listen and care, which also dissuades me from believing I\u2019m an xNTP, but it\u2019s possible I have developed a stronger Fe given my type.

{"submission": "yo. I'm new to the reddit world but I'm hoping to find someone willing enough to help suggest what my MBTI might be. thanks in advance. keep in mind, my enneagram is a 1w9 (perfectionistic, hard-working, virtuous, while striving for peace, tranquility and calm). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA recap of me:\n\n* organized, hand my work on in-time, always look for the efficient way to do things\n* high-achiever, a perpetual-learner (knowing that there will always be something for me to learn, get better at and understand, makes me eternally excited for life)\n* susceptible to being too focused on my public image (sometimes it's a struggle to go outside)\n* strive for a peaceful life and am mostly comfortable in my own daily routines, but still love seeking occasional thrills in life. I LOVE rollercoasters and theme parks and going out on-a-whim every once in a while, but I think my limit of thrill-seeking may be lower compared to others due to my high sense of responsibility\n* keep to myself, very private, but friendly and smile a lot (I'm always up to make a new friend, unless I don't think my values align with yours. In that case, I'll probably avoid you completely)\n* start conversations with others by asking what they're working on, or how they've been, or what they've done over the weekend. I never start a convo by talking about myself or coming up with some crazy/funny out-of-pocket ideas like my brother (ENTP 7w8)\n* love working on creative projects for artistic expression. Though all my projects are derived from some sort of inspiration as I don't usually come up with art completely on my own\n* go with the flow in social groups. I'm not even in a social group (besides family) and hang-out with people one-on-one most comfortably, but when I'm forced into group projects, I let others make the decisions\n* think about the past naturally, but try not to dwell too much (struggled with that before)\n* deep-thinker, always reflecting, always trying to be introspective.

{"submission": "So I\u2019ve been introduced by my friend to the typology sphere. And we\u2019re having an ongoing debate about whether I am an, intj, istj, or entj. I highly doubt istj though because I am pretty flexible and not really bent on rules. But we\u2019ll see \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. If there are typos, no there aren\u2019t. \n\nSome descriptions of myself, I\u2019ll try to stay completely objective. I\u2019ll also use the given prompt to help me out a bit. \n\n- For starters, I am a young adult living abroad for school. I am a pre med biological sciences major and minor in chemistry. My goal is to be become a radiologist hopefully by time I am 30. When you first meet me I am very quiet and will not speak unless spoken to. However if I like you enough and we became friends, I WILL talk your head off \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I can get witty and joke around a bit. I dress pretty alt/casual ig? I like comfortable clothes and pretty much wear black. Same with my shoes, I wear crocs strictly unless I am working. I\u2019d be a great marketer for crocs. They are my true love \ud83d\ude0d. \n\n- I work as a chef, but I hate it. It doesn\u2019t give me an intellectually stimulating environment. And I am surrounded by other chefs that do not know how to work productively. My options are thin though bc I live abroad. \n\n- I love debate. I take multiple classes surrounding it. \n\n- Am I not an authority type of person, I will always question whether or not they deserve to hold that title. I\u2019ll accept it if they have been proven to work well, if not I\u2019ll stay suspicious. I\u2019m just suspicious in general. \n\n- My mind runs on ten. I\u2019ll talk about something then get distracted talking about something else, then I\u2019ll go back to the main point. \n\n- Mutual respect is my middle name, why should I respect you, if you do not respect me? \n\n- Highly suspicious and I do not take other peoples words at face value. \n\n- Growing up I was a \u201cwhy\u201d kid. I ask a lot of questions still, my goal is to throughly understand. \n\n- When I\u2019m arguing I\u2019m the type of person to say \u201cit\u2019s the principle of the matter!\u201d \n\n- I love having alone time unbothered to let me do the things I wanna do. \n\n- I like many activities. I\u2019m pretty flexible with things I enjoy, I don\u2019t mind trying new things either. As long as it isn\u2019t too dangerous but even then, if there was a roller coaster that looked pretty unsafe\u2026 I may get on it. I am relatively good at sports, I love soccer and played it throughout my highschool years. However, I cannot do too many outdoor things or I\u2019ll be too drained. So to compensate by playing video games like, animal crossing, genshin, baldurs gate, and saints row. A good variety id say. \n\n- I am a self proclaimed master at strategizing. I even strategize the way I\u2019m going to shop. It\u2019s a habit of mine that I do the organize my thoughts and actions. I never improvise, yuck. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m sorry but I am one of those people that have to throughly plan vacations or I will not have fun \ud83d\ude2d. For example went to Disneyland with friends and I planned the routes we were going to go a week before. I can go with the flow sometimes though. If it\u2019s not important sure, but if I\u2019m trying to have maximum amount of enjoyment, I will plan accordingly. Even with projects. \n\n- It takes me FOREVER to make important decisions. I have to weigh out everything to make sure it is the best answer. And I wish wash bc I\u2019m adding more info that could either make it or break it. So I change my mind quite a lot. It frustrates other people but you don\u2019t understand if I do not think it through, I will be heavily unsatisfied. \n\n- Very future oriented. I love to plan my future out. I already have. I\u2019m just a big planner in general. A good plan that considers different possibilities is a nice one. \n\n- I\u2019m not really an emotional type of person, makes me uncomfortable. Only emotion I\u2019ll usually show is anger, that\u2019s it. \n\n- I\u2019m a matter of fact type of person. I\u2019ll give you a straight answer or if I can\u2019t it\u2019s because there are too many things to take into account. Just give me some time. \n\n- I\u2019m impatient so I love patient people. \n\n- I start things I never finish because I get bored easily, I do that with art and tv shows or movies. Never finish shows for the life of me. \n\n- Perfectionist, I hold myself to a HIGH standard. Getting anything less than an A is unacceptable. And to this day I go by that standard. \n\n- However I\u2019m very flexible and open to the opinions of others. That doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t challenge your opinion though. If it has been backed up well I\u2019ll accept it quickly and throw out my last opinion I held. \n\n- I am the least judgemental person you\u2019ll ever meet. Usually because I do not care what you do. I have my own stuff to worry about. If it makes you happy and doesn\u2019t hurt other people, do you boo. \n\n- I\u2019m the type of person when arguing to say \u201cshow me your stats?\u201d While I have mine on standby. \n\n- If I don\u2019t value the rules I\u2019ll break them. \n\n- I work systematically, with anything. I like things to be done efficiently. Like I\u2019m big on efficiency and it makes me mad if others aren\u2019t like that. With video games, communication anything I\u2019m like that. \n\n- Aspirations I have are to become a doctor, buy a house and have a child maybe. A child because idk, I would love to pass my knowledge down while loving someone greatly. And I like taking care of kids. I would adopt though, why add one more kid to the problem when there are already kids here. I always say if I were a billionaire I would adopt as many kids as I can to give them a fair chance at life. If they take it or not it\u2019s up to them, but at least they have a choice ya know. My personal aspirations are to gain more people in my life? Not too many but people I can interact with intellectually. I\u2019m studying overseas so it\u2019s hard to make friends here and frankly I\u2019m not interested because they wouldn\u2019t last in the long run. \n\n- I\u2019m pretty inconsistent myself and when it comes to solutions I have a hard time find one bc there are multiple possibilities and I\u2019m weighing out pros and cons. Does it work? It\u2019s it efficient? Can I throw this idea out?\n\n- I\u2019m often forgetful because I\u2019m in my head a lot. I\u2019ve lost some things that were right in front of me. And I hurt myself quite a bit. I\u2019m a chef so my arms and hands are quite raggedy. \n\n- I also love religion and always question why we let it reign over our lives. \n\nIf you have any questions, shoot.

{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\n23, male. Computer science major. Consider myself very calm, not very emotional on the outside. Love to solve puzzles. I'm looking to become a software engineer after I finish school. I enjoy playing video games, singing, and watching anime and reading manga. Not much else too me tbh.\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy family was Christian, but not super duper religious. I went to church when I was young but stopped going once I hit high school. Realized that religion just didn't interest me so I stopped pursuing it.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nAs mentioned above, I am a CS major and looking to become a software engineer in the near future. I overall enjoy my classes, but I wouldn't say it's ride or die. It's enough to open many doors for me and to allow myself to make a good living. That's about it.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI feel like if I had friends, I would wanna do something with them. Unless I'm staying home with an SO, I would much rather hang out with friends or dates. Yes, if I am really exhausted, I do need some time to rest and recharge but after that, I'm ready to have fun again.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nVideo games, anime & manga, singing. Played baseball, soccer, and basketball when I was a kid but fell out of it due to competition. I enjoy sports like dodgeball and stuff like that. But I'm not a very active person. I much rather get my exercise passively like riding my bike or walking to do daily activities like groceries, errands, etc.\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nNot very curious to be honest. I don't think about random ideas all the time. My ideas are related to what my future will look like and how I plan to make it a reality with hard work and determination.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to it, but it isn't something I actively seek. If it is a leadership position in something I know and am confident in doing, then I can do it well. I wouldn't be an asshole leader but calm and rational in telling others what to do in order to accomplish something. I wouldn't get a power trip.\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI would say I'm pretty coordinated. I've always been a kinesthetically aware individual on whichever activity I would be doing (sports, painting, fixing something, dancing, etc.) I find working with my hands to be somewhat fun, but not something that I go crazy over. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI thought I was, but I really am not that artistic. Only thing I might end up doing in the future is painting, but I don't think I have the drive to pursue that.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI have varying opinions on each notion of time.\n\nPast: Tend to have a very negative about it since that is when I was inferior compared to where I am now.\n\nPresent: Neutral. I focus on what I need to do now so that I can live the life I wanna live in the future.\n\nFuture: When not stressed, very positive. I have a lot of things to look forward to in the future and I tend to have a very optimistic look towards the future, when I am not stressed or freaking out over something.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIf my parents tell me to do something, I will always do it. But it's not in a sort of way where I'm happy to do it, rather I need to get it over with so I can go back to what I was doing before. I certainly don't mind helping people, but I sort of help others with a resistant willingness.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nNot really no. I just prefer to understand things and to have them make sense.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nEfficiency isn't as important as productivity. Being productive helps me stay on track and helps me to accomplish my goals and tasks.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nNo, I don't control others. I don't like to control others.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI like singing because I just like singing. It's a fun activity. Video games are also fun. Same with manga and anime. It's all just fun for me.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI never really learned best with boring lectures. I always learn best by practicing something or doing something over and over again until I get the hang of it. Like in my CS classes, a lot of what is taught sticks with me when I have a chance to practice the concepts that are being taught and understanding them on a deeper level.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI'm more of an improviser than a strategist when it comes to projects. But I find strategy to be very important too.\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI want to move to Scotland and live my life there after I finish undergrad. I want to settle down and get married, but I don't want kids. I just want to live a normal life over there.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nIn terms of phobias, spiders. Hate those fuckers.\n\nIn terms of actual fears: having my efforts go in vain, failure, gloomy future when nothing is working, being alone (romantically and socially), not living the life I wanna live\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nWhen I am on top of my game and I am paving through life with goals in mind and making those dreams a reality.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nWhen it feels like I have no future and there's no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI sometimes daydream, but only if I am really bored. Otherwise, I am pretty grounded. When I do daydream, I am still somewhat paying attention to my surroundings so I've certainly never ran into any light posts or anything.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nMy future plans and future scenarios about those plans. I'll also daydream about falling in love with the love of my life.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt can take some time to really hone in on a decision, especially when I've looked at the pros and cons of something and really analyzed the best path forward, but once I hone in on something I almost never change course.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI think emotions are important, but sometimes you need to set the aside to get a job down. I tend to stay away from negative emotions and only try to think positively. Whenever I am grieving, I will never cry at the funeral, but tears will fall down silently when I am in bed late at night the same day. I am ***VERY*** private with my emotions. The only person I will ever emotionally confide into would be my SO or like my best friend or brother (not even my parents I will show my emotional side to them; too embarassing). \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI don't agree just to appease them, but I never rock the boat because I don't need that kind of heat on me. I don't mind silence if I have nothing else to say.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI never break the rules. Authority should only be challenged if they are being objectively wrong or unreasonable. Otherwise, I don't mind following rules if it makes sense.\n\n ", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hey guys! I think im an INFJ or INFP 4w3 sp/so or so/sp 496 but im not compeletly sure, so some help would be appreciated! I understand that the enneagram is about a person\u2019s childhood struggles and thus it exposes the ugliest part of an individual, so im gonna try to be as transparent about negative traits as possible!\n\nTw: mentions of ED!!\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been really into typology these past few years, but nothing snatched my interest like the enneagram has so far. I\u2019ve been reading articles and books on the enneagram for years and I\u2019ve just established this habit of subconsciously typing people around me 24/7. \u201cOh, {insert name} is taking 3 hours to get ready? That is so sx3 of them\u201d \u201cDid {insert name} just say that they would rather follow the rules to stay safe? I knew they were a so6\u201d just a little preview of how my inner monologue works at most times.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a quite observant kid, except as a kid I used to imagine myself in a show and then assign random people random roles that they fulfill in the play of my life. This has always been my style of thinking I guess, being the youngest in a family of 6, I was too young to relate to any of my older siblings so although I was babied and pampered most of the time (which I loved btw which I carve validation) at the end of the day, everyone would just go back to their lives as I just sat their in the sideline looking at everything and applying it to my head, daydreaming quietly.\nIn fact, in retrospect, I noticed that I usually loved being quiet and \u201cobedient\u201d because I noticed that I got praised for it a whole lot and so I saw being quiet and reserved rewarding in a way, cause even if I did not perform in school as my other siblings/peers or failed to achieve a huge achievement like winning first place in a competition or being healthy and in good shape, I can at least take pride in the fact that I was an \u201ceasy\u201d child. I was usually too busy with my thoughts anyway, analyzing and assigning my surroundings with parts, essentially, I envisioned this mental play of mine to be my future in a sense. I had a very specific image of my adult self, being special, unique, outstanding, and getting praised for it! But not too special that I provoke violence or resentment towards myself, just slight envy, as I still deep down really valued validation and admiration, to my core. I also felt deep envy for people for being able to live out a certain aspect of my dreams, such as celebrities, peers, distant relatives, etc. however being surrounded by 7 adults (my family) at all times was beyond exhausting, I was constantly told what to pursue, what to be, how to behave, etc. by all of my siblings and parents, it became quite contradictory and confusing as they all had differing high expectations from me to the point where I never really got to fully appease everybody which eventually led to me being burnt out and pretty much being a disappointment to everybody. Which led to feelings of intense shame that were converted into growing quite distant and becoming extremely volatile as a young teen.\n\nRight now as an adult, I still have the same exact dynamic with my family and with my dreams except im quite literally pushed to the side at all times as my family kind of gave up all of their hopes for me and are too busy with their own lives, most of my siblings have established new small families of their own and with everyone being able to relate to their adult struggles (marriage, children, work) I\u2019m quite literally constantly pushed to the side except for when I have a big decision to make then suddenly everyone\u2019s involved in my life all over again, and so I just started remaining numb rather than reacting or speaking up. \n\nAs for my social life, I\u2019m introverted and aloof although I fantasize about romance, belonging, having a well-established life where I can feel openly expressive, but still make people envy me (I feel guilty just admitting this but it\u2019s true) and once I get close to someone I become more expressive, and chatty, and complacent, and open, I also just love to help people in general, again being of great help helps make me feel validated. Also I tend to me more confident when around groups of friends. I long for an idealistic social status where I have friends and a partner that I can romanticize. \n\nLastly, I find comfort in sorrow, as much as I hate admitting it, it makes me feel entitled. I love suffering in silence and then have people find it out and make them pity me silently as  I tell them \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to worry about\u201d or something more aggressive/defensive like \u201cshut up, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me\u201d. Suffering in silence followed by a quiet realization made me feel validated and worthy of love. Especially since I lack many skills and I feel like im less than everyone else, I feel like being someone that ppl could praise out of pity kind of brought me some form of comfort. i mean smth that I did in high school that I hate admitting is that I went through an ED and I would kind of quietly flaunt the fact that I am not eating, and having people voice their concerns followed by me going \u201cno im good trust me\u201d made me feel worthwhile, like I\u2019m not so bad after all. Also I constantly compare myself to others and I get obsessive with validation/attention from people that I form an interest in to the point where I start neglecting my own wellbeing and try to appease/attract them as much as possible.\n\nThrough all of this though, I usually have a semi-easygoing/sunny demeanor, like im just chilling.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just need someone help type me :)", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Something that has always brought me to tears is rebellion. Rebellion for a cause. Although not for a true cause in the stereotypical sense of the word, rebellion for one's own heart; is an experience of one's own self in the world. A man growing angry at their old age: their bones are more frail, muscles are not what they used to be and now they struggle to do what they used to enjoy. The agonising yet alluring idea that we were thrust into this world against our own will: we gazed into a well, not full of water, but full of abyss. And chance stood beside us and, with an indifferent nudge, pushed us right in, where we would be thrust into a world full of the same amount of randomness; many even get thrust in and don't last a few minutes. The passion, the smouldering hatred against chance that some feel as the void absolves them is one that I find tremendous beauty in. Scraping at the void and reaming at the one who pushed us in is a hopeless struggle, and I find beauty in acknowledging that and in spite of it, still persisting because of one's soul. Now, I don't find pure beauty in this alone, without any additional developments; it is foolish to waste one's life away scrapping at something that could never be. But I find incredible beauty in the immensity of the attempt; and even more so in the transition from such a powerful sense of obstinacy, into a solemn, accepting glide. Drifting with the same ardour as one tried to project into a climb. And in this, I find happiness.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": " \u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? \n\nYes, I am currently diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder. I also experience depersonalization/derealization, but it's subsumed under MDD rather than being its own disorder in my case. I also have some kind of anxiety disorder but I'm not sure what the specific diagnosis is.\n\n \u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? \n\nI was brought up under a Christian home. Early on, I was already having a lot of issues with it on the moral side. I remember constantly telling people that they were sexist at one point until I was seriously reprimanded for it. I hated how certain things were immoral when I couldn't understand why they were immoral. I became an agnostic atheist around the age of 12. For the most part, I kept my beliefs to myself. I'm a very fearful person. The times when I stood up for my beliefs were the exceptions, not the norm.\n\n \u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n\nI would definitely feel refreshed. I can go for very long periods of time while being by myself. It feels very peaceful to me. I'm socially introverted to the point that people often think there's something wrong to me. I remember having teachers/counselors trying to get me to make friends. I did and do have friends, but they're all online.\n\n \u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities? \n\nI'm okay at sports but I don't like them at all. Almost all of the activities that I enjoy are indoor activities. I really just spend most of my time watching/reading things online and playing video games. When I do play video games, I often put a lot of my time and effort into them. I put in about 4000+ hours into one indie game. I remember modding the game just so I could practice on this one certain mechanic. I usually care about the mechanics of the game the most, but I need the aesthetics to pop out enough and be pleasant enough for me to actually play the game.\n\n \u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forms of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. \n\nNo, I am certainly not artistic. I can technically understand why people like art, but I DEFINITELY don't like art myself. I don't even like music. Sometimes this makes me feel quirky and at other times it makes me feel dead inside.\n\n \u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? \n\nI definitely don't control others on a conscious level. I'd much rather let them fully make their own decisions. It's strange to me that this question is even a thing.\n\n \u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? \n\nI think that I daydream way too often, but I almost never run into anything even though I'm not aware of my surroundings when I do daydream. I have definitely received comments that I live in a different world, but I don't think that's about daydreaming. That's usually about the weird things I say and the weird positions I hold. I usually daydream about certain fantasies, arguments, and possibly just some novel idea I came up with that interests me.\n\n \u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? \n\nIt usually takes me a long time to process my emotions. I was an EXTREMELY sensitive kid. I remember a red cup being placed near me when I was in the first grade. That red cup was put on the table to signify that you should stop talking. I interpreted it as the teacher telling me that I'm a bad person, and I had a panic attack. I made an oath to myself to NEVER speak in school again. I definitely didn't keep this oath, but I did become selectively mute in school from the rest of 1st grade-8th grade because of it. While I ruminated on certain emotions for a long time, I also sometimes just experienced them and then easily moved on. Emotions are basically the reason why I move everyday, but that's the same for everyone. Of course they're extremely important to me. If I didn't have them, I would be absolutely nothing. I'm now dealing with apathy rather than sensitivity, and to me it's far, FAR worse.\n\nI'm going to end it there cause I think that people won't read it if it's any longer. My belief in the MBTI is pretty limited. I'm mainly just doing this to see how others see me.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nCurrently studying for a bachelor of engineering degree (mainly due to job prospects and due to my strength in STEM as my hobbies will provide no income whatsoever).\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nRefreshed as heck (Socialize is fun...until the battery drained out).\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer?

What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI have many ideas (and half of them have to consult with others for ethical standards).

Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI would take the role IF no one takes it (I prefer to be in the backstage). If I take it, then the group would be either going nowhere or going somewhere with visibly unhappy members. My leadership style would be the 'direct' kind, screw emotions as this is a project.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not?

If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI am not artistic as I suck at drawing (but I can make blueprints). But if I could, I think it would be abstract kind as it offered many interpretations (and I hate it when people claim that my interpretation is wrong like it is abstract ffs).\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI'd to live in all three (but I am skewed toward the future and the past). I often ask 'what-if' and then create a timeline in my head or find answers somewhere else.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI would help if I had the energy to do it (which is like only happened during the first 10% of my day...if I had my coffee). Otherwise, I would consider whether it's reasonable to help or not.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nMaybe yes, maybe no. Sometimes I could see that I needed it but other times not.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nMeh, not that important (unless tests are coming)\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nTruth to be told, yes. I prefer to do it indirectly mainly for privacy\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nDoing origami, fixing stuff, planespotting, etc. I don't even know why I love it so much but oh well =))\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style would be 'Observational learning' for physical stuff, and 'reading and think' for theoretical stuff. I struggle in learning by listening (I can find a bunch of interpretations in your sentence and stuck at step 1 because I have no idea which is the correct way). I prefer classes that do experiments (theoretical stuff can be fun but also boring over time).\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you tend to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI can think of a strategy... but failed to do it anyway (procrastinating). What I can do is create a big outline with goals... then do whatever I can (legally) to reach those goals. That includes improvising things.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI think I care more about the journey rather than the results... but if the results affect me in life then the journey be damned.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nFear of betrayal, losing friends, long socialization, attending a party alone. Why? I am hard to befriend, I try walking on eggshells but... the friendships just ended and I don't know why. The latter two stem from social anxiety (I guess, not getting a formal diagnosis yet).\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nMy high would be extremely happy and thrilling for the new experience, or after achieving a life goal. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nDepressed, probably think of why I failed the goal, finding alternative ways to reach the goal.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI'd say muttering is a way to ground me (if not then I'll fall asleep and dream somewhere far away... or daydreaming about the future in general).\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about it?\n\nFirst 30 mins probably nothing, and then I pondered my life choices until I fell asleep.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI would say not really long and regret it later (if give me a chance to change then a 50/50 depends on the situation).\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI think Emotions are extremely important to a human...but I suck at expressing it and would find songs that I may or may not relate to at the time. or doing random contemporary dance moves to express the negativity.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI usually choose agree-to-disagree if the convo is going nowhere (and do not question further after the agree-to-disagree as the relationship might get fractured).\n\n\u2022 Do you break the rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break the rules, why?\n\nUsually, I would follow rules and regulations mainly to avoid the 'confrontation' or 'consequences' part. But willing to defend if I break any. And authority should always be challenged (Debate helps things progress... unless it's going nowhere).", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

My second biggest fear is death itself, even if i die a calm and soft death, whats waiting us after that makes me afraid, it makes me existential and worried.\n\nWhats your biggest desire? \n\nCurrently, being a successful architect and make a lot of money, i am very stressed when i feel i dont have enough money, my mood completely change based on how much money i have. \n\nWhat are you the best at? \n\nI will brag about my creativity. I have a very vivid and rich imagination, reason why i'm very confident about my career on arts. \n\nHow do you see yourself right now?\n\nLast days have been hard, socially speaking, i am emotionally tired and i have a headache, now, more generally, i'm happy i could make good improvements on my essay writting skills, i'm planning to enter one of the best architecture universities on the country, and with my current improvements, i feel that's totally achievable.\n\nHow do you see yourself 5 years from now?\n\nI am the best student of my class. I have my leed green associate certificate. I am improving on my specialization on sustainable architecture and making myself an excellent professional. \n\nHow do you express yourself?\n\nOn the most diverse ways u can imagine. In terms of subjectivity, i like to express myself very dramatically thro fictional stories and characters, in terms of interpersonal relations it depends, i can be serious, funny, direct or sensitive, i am not that most consistent on that. \n\nHow do you feel about those near you (family, friends)?\n\nI value and love them very much and i'm ways weighting how my decisions might affect them. \n\nHow do you feel about strangers?\n\nIndifferent or negatively/critical most of the time. Although i strive for empathy. \n\nHow do you view change/uncertainty?\n\nI like change, but I don't like uncertainty. I need to know what will happen and have things settled down. Uncertainty makes me anxious and nervous. Now change, ive been changing since my first memories, outwardly or inwardly, i believe change cant be avoided and thats the natural course of things. \n\nHow do you make decisions?\n\nI weight my own feelings and those of people i love and/or i feel that need me. I regret my decisions pretty often, either out of a sense of detachment and doubt about whether i'm following my own and right path or not, either because i'm hugely inspired by something new.\n\nHow do you deal with your emotions?\n\nBadly, i hate my emotions sometimes, they can be beautiful aesthetically, but most of the time i feel my feelings are delaying me. My emotions can be incredibly, i will repeat, incredibly explosive, so i'm constantly under pressure of trying to keep them under control. \n\nWhat do you hope to avoid doing or being?\n\nI don't want to harm others, be cruel to them, i have some strange beliefs about Karma. \n\nHow do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself?\n\nI guess people see me as a loyal and knowledgeable friend, and depending on the person, it will have specific nuances on their view of me, some will say i'm very extraverted and funny and others will think i'm too serious or polite. I want people to see me as someone beautiful and important to them or to see value in my work. \n\nDescribe how you experience each of: a) Anger; b) Shame; c) Anxiety\n\nA- explosions, tyrannical and harsh expressiveness, hard to control. \n\nB- I withdraw from whatever situation is causing me shame. I can't stand the feeling. \n\nC- i guess i have some physical symptoms of anxiety, my heartbeats get faster etc etc, and i also get hyperactive. \n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI did have a religious upbringing, and i easily assimilated into it on my childhood, i believed in god, a good and gentle god, and i believed he would always help me. Then i started studying astronomy and became more curious and critical, also, the repression of my sexuality made me create a strong grudge against abrahamic religions, and after studying more and more, i have decided its one of the main cancers that delay humanity. \n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI feel neither, probably only bothered. \n\nWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like activities that make me feel like i had a fun moment, or that was productive, so i like working on creativity projects, and i also do like some sports, if practiced with people i like instead of competing with strangers, i believe it can be a lot of fun, and the sensation of exhaustion after such activities are also good, bed never feels better than these moments. I don't like feelings trapped, in small houses or places for too long, i need to get out, get some fresh air and walk. \n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am very curious about existentialist matters. I dont have more ideas than i can execute.", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "well, she's usually the type of person to invite you out or get invited out, agree to go, then come up with a long texted excuse on why she can't go, which is pretty obviously a lie, to me at least. she's a pretty anxious person, can be paranoid out about literally anything, even if there's no reason to. like when she sees someone's marriage break apart after 30 years, or someone's husband change their gender after 10 years together. she feels compassion for these people, then thinks \"omg what if that happens to me.\" she projects other people's problems on herself, as if they'll find exactly her and happen to her.\nI know it doesn't have much to do with mbti, but I'll mention it anyways; she prefers to have everything organised and cannot stand, when her place is a mess. my friend will start an argument with her sister, when she leaves some mess behind, then clean that up for her and complain about it. she is a pretty compassionate person I'd say, but she usually will call herself bad and a bitch. the reason for this is probably that she feels annoyed by most people(she's currently in an environment that is not very good for her). there are times, when she has \"no choice but to be nice\" to some people and remain good relationship, since they can be pretty useful to her. I don't really think it's good for her and the annoyance building up inside.\nsometimes, she wants to gossip about someone, and I do not, which leads to her saying \"I'm bad, I like to gossip. but you don't, you're nice\" and stuff like that. \nI suppose she's not very good at understanding someone else's point. I wanna quote one of our conversations for a better example:\n*sends a picture of someone's nails* \"these are terrible, and this person used to say something about my taste\"\n\"well, she probably things those are pique of fashion\"\n\"they're awful, I don't understand how someone can like that\"\n\"people have different tastes\"\n\"nope, there are those, who have taste, and those who don't\"\nand during next 30 minutes I tried to explain, how tastes and likings can variate from person to person, and how relative the whole concept is. even made a small model of how she perceives \"taste\". to no avail, she still thinks there's only way to that. these type of convos are pretty common between as. there are times, when we hear someone in public put a song on speakers and walk around. she starts immediately complaining and pointing out how these people are impolite, how can someone not give a damn about bothering others in a public place and so on. when she goes into whole \"I'm a bad person\" mood, and I try to assure her that she's not, she'd bring up something from the past to put herself down like \"remember when you were happy about something, laughing and jumping around? I thought you were like a freak.\" \nwanna mention that she has a habit, from ever since I've known her, of watching the same things all over again. bringing up her old hobbies, old favourite bands, singers and other nostalgic stuff. I suppose it gives her some sense of security and safety. \nI've confronted her about her anxiety and problems many times, explained how I've gone through all that(I have anxiety as well, though it's way better now). how therapy was incredibly helpful, how easier it makes your life and so on. but I suppose she doesn't want to accept help or feels guilty of doing so, she usually brushes it off, leaves me on read and them changes the subject. that happens when we had few arguments during the time we've known each other, too, by the way. why I'm willing to talk things through, she's not really.\nI also want to mention that she's a really good friend. she listens to me, whenever i need it, tries to give advice, when possible. she's pretty empathetic, as I mentioned earlier. a reddit story about someone's trauma may put her in a state of sadness for some time, as an example.\n\nI have that inner desire to figure out everyone's mbti, and while it's easier for me to type someone I don't know that well intuitively and, mostly, accurately, I cannot figure out her type. she took a test a few times, but I honestly don't trust those, since they have failed me so many times. she's not interested in learning about mbti further either. so I'd be grateful if anyone could help me type her.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

At least in a way, parents were very accepting of who I was although I was (and still am) quite emotionally distant, not because I fear they'll judge me or anything... I just struggle to open up, especially when it comes to love, I've always really struggled with telling my parents about any girlfriends or anything - that's probably very normal I think I just found it exceptionally awkward.\n\n \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI think I'd like it... I usually get very tired just from the outside world... I always get home from college basically dead haha...\n\n \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious! I think? I love coming up with ideas, I think the way I view the world is probably the core of my entire identity. I have a very very strange way of seeing things I think... I came up with a concept recently that I found super interesting. I have a few in mind after saying that so I'm just gonna flip a coin to decide lmao. Okay, this one - so I was wondering initially (this is what led me to the final though) \"if someone gets put on a machine that makes them feel unfathomably good, and then get taken off of it and given the chance to stay off or go back on, do they have a choice or does their external environment just command them?\". This led me to come up with a better version: (imo) if someone came into my home, put a gun to my head and demanded I do an extremely simple task, or I die - and I have completely free will (atleast theoretically) to make whichever choice I wanted - do I actually have free will? If I value my life, logic commands me to complete the task - lets say its something extremely simple like there are no cons to completing it, like say, touching the wall in front of me - all logic commands me to complete that task. But in a way that isn't me making a decision is it? I'm being commanded by the circumstances of my external environment. So my idea was what if we made that pointless, unreasonable choice, just because? It's an absurd reasoning, sure, but a very human one imo. Another one I had was this notion of truth. I often see an infinite amount of possibilities and it leads me to overthink things heavily. I mean I have this whole idea that truth cannot reasonably exist - this idea is an embodiment of this overthinking attitude. The best way I can explain it is with this: \u201cto prove god does not exist, you have to look him in the eyes and tell him.\u201d Because i mean, when I die, I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll find god\u2026 the potential is ALWAYS there for god to exist, maybe we just haven\u2019t found him yet? There\u2019s always \u201cmaybe we just haven\u2019t figured it out yet\u201d, always. It\u2019s like, even with \u201cconcrete\u201d things. If I point in front of me and say that there is a raccoon there, evidently we can both conclude that there isn\u2019t\u2026 but (now this might seem like a stretch but I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable) there\u2019s always a chance that that raccoon is just hidden from us, in some far off plane that is connected to that point and space in time we just can\u2019t see it. It\u2019s highly unlikely but, we could never prove it false right? We can\u2019t prove something to be true unless we prove it to be false and to prove it to be false we must witness it, which, it would then be true\u2026\n\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot really, I mean, I can at times and I think I like doing things in my own way - honestly though I've never really been put to the test? And when I do get put into positions of leadership I get incredibly bossy and critical, I hate it.\n\n \n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not gonna go into much depth but I feel like it was worth touching on - I dislike it, a lot, although when I was a kid I remember loving to climb trees, building lego I mean until I turned around 14, I wanted to be a mechanic!\n\n \n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI think I do in a sense, yeah. I sometimes will say things just because I know that person will like me for it. I'm not a people pleaser in the slightest - in fact I actually can sometimes cause conflict just for the sake of it: like I remember often in highschool my friendgroup would come ask me to come out and even if I really wanted to, sometimes I'd just refuse... out of a sort of spite I think? But like I remember in school when I wanted to become popular, I sat next to a popular kid and analysed what kinda jokes made him laugh, I then made LOTS of those jokes and it worked!\n\n \n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have EXTREMELY high highs, like seriously. I mean. I even often have them in lows sort of? I sometimes dive into extremely cynical pits of sadness and I can often criticise people for just \"believing\" things - like saying \"oh I believe love is a powerful energy force\", I'm usually just like \"huh? How can you believe that?\" but I really do have moments where I think I get it! I just think sense drags me back down, which sucks a little I guess. I often get very weirded out by the notion of love, it can (and sometimes does) upset me greatly after those moments of \"highs\" when I come to the realisation that love is really all their is to live; I really hate the notion that \"happiness is the meaning to life\", I don't want to explain that but I hate it.\n\n \n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nNot very at all... I used to be! When I was a kid. And I remember in highschool I would always get terrified of being seen daydreaming so I just wouldn't. I remember fearing looking like my mum. I love her! So much, don't get me wrong, but she would always do this thing where she would just stare off into the distance and not think... I always wondered why she did that but I hated it, I didn't want to look like that.\n\nThank you so so so so so much for reading this", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hello\n\nI usually get INTP/ENTP/ENTJ/ESTJ/ISTP on tests \n\nHowever I'm sure we all know tests aren't super reliable. I've done thorough research on cognitive functions and have been investigating my own thoughts and thought process, and I gotta say, I use all of the functions a lot. \n\nEspecially choosing between Ne-Si/Ni-Se axis is difficult for me because I use both very often. However if I had to go for one only, it would be Ne-Si. But I also use Ni-Se strongly\n\nGoing over to Te-Fi/Ti-Fe, I can say that I cannot relate to Fi at all. I'm not sure if I even understand what it is fully, or what it does, or how it works in your brain. I can explain how I use Ne, Ni, Se, Si, Fe, Ti and Te functions, but Fi? I cannot. I can't grasp it. \n\nI do use Fe somewhat, I think of what is socially acceptable and I think of what the other party's reaction will be based on their personality and even though I don't alter what I say or be dishonest, I know what to say and what not to. So I think I definitely do use Fe/it's not my Blindspot. However I'm not super good at it. I can be really (unintentionally) insensitive, at times arrogant,even disruptive. Sometimes I even leave the room without saying anything because I want out. I also try to keep quiet to not say something that seems offensive to the other person because that's what happens sometimes, and I don't notice it because I don't intend it to be that way. \n\nI use Te to get shit done. Whenever I want something to get done quickly my te is subconsciously on, making plans and determining the most efficient and useful way of accomplishing said thing. I also use it often in combination with the other functions, it sort of helps me get through life easier. But I'm not super aggressive with my Te. \n\nTi for me is my default, natural mode, just questioning things almost like second nature. Sometimes I'm like a sponge sucking every piece of info I can gather. I question anything and everything based on the information I've already collected and research random tidbits that I think of out of nowhere to gain more info, almost like connecting everything I've learned so far together and trying to see what that piece of information might suggest in my life, possibly in the future or now. Or maybe to judge what has happened in the past. \n\nSi is tricky for me. I can have really shitty memory, can be forgetful and scatter brained. But I did notice I compare new experiences to past ones in order to find what to do in current situations. But I'm not super detail oriented and quite frankly can find being detail obsessive a waste of time. \n\nSe is also a bit tricky but I don't hate it. I like having control of my external surroundings, I like when I just wing it and somehow make things turn out well. I have been told I have good reflexes pretty often. My awareness of surroundings is not terrible but it definitely isn't awesome either. I'm usually lost in random thoughts that I forget about quickly after. \n\nIf I had to say something about how I use fi,.or at least what I think my Fi is, is sometimes I get really down in the depths. And I start asking myself what am I? Who.am I? What do I do? What do I want to do? And then it goes away and I go back to normal. I think that might be the fi lmao. \n\nWhat do you think my type is? I tried to include as.much of my thought process as possible. \n\nThanks!", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": " ENTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "I believe I\u2019m an Fi dominant: I\u2019m driven strongly by how I feel, I\u2019m quite moody and I value authenticity ALOT.\n\nBut often times when I\u2019m really upset about how my life is just \u201ctears in rain\u201d, I start to beat myself up about it?

{"submission": "Hi. I\u2019ve taken the 16p test a few times last year and been in MBTI subs for a few months now, and my result goes back and forth from ENFJ, INFP, and INTP. My result has always depended on my current situation:\n\n\u2022 During a time I had to act like how I think my best self would act for an important event, I scored ENFJ. I could definitely relate to the type a lot but I was also stressed during that time, so it makes everything confusing. \n\u2022 During a time I was depressed, I scored INFP. Then, when I was picking myself up from that low place, I scored INTP.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve started to learn about the cognitive functions and type myself. Here\u2019s what I found out: I use Ne, Te/Ti or Se, Fi/Fe, and my inferior function is most likely Si. \n\n** Note that I\u2019m not too sure about the order that I use the other functions.\n\nI\u2019ve checked the possible types with that function stack and matched with either ENTP or ESTP. I can relate to both of them, but neither of them cover who I mostly am. If I had to choose which type I relate to more it\u2019d be ENTP, but when I see other ENTPs in MBTI subs, one thing I don\u2019t relate to is their confidence. I am pretty confident in my qualities and abilities but I never go around telling people I\u2019m the best, which I\u2019ve seen happen to both online and irl ENTPs.  I feel like I\u2019d only be as verbally self-promoting as them if I was in a miserable spot in life, so this pushes me to the ESTP side; however because they\u2019re the \u201cEntrepreneur\u201d of the MBTI, I reckon they\u2019re also self-promoting but is it as verbal as ENTP? My way of self-promoting is by letting my results speak for themselves rather than talking about them. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could give me tips on how to gain more clarity on my type? It could also help if anyone can tell which type\u2019s vibe I exude. I\u2019m willing to answer any clarifying questions about myself. \n\nThank you in advance. :)", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": " ESTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Thanks in advance! \n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am a 19 year old male. I generally keep to myself, and I am generally described to be reserved, but unfortunately as well as unapproachable/cold. To be honest, I wish I didn\u2019t come off that way but it is what it is.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nAnxiety and depression.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nAs a kid, I was introduced into a religious influence from both my family and relatives, but my response to it was generally respectful but I wasn\u2019t really adamant on it. I essentially respected their belief and morals, but I wasn\u2019t a firm believer in the overall structure. Throughout my childhood, I was  known to be a quiet, reserved, and shy individual who didn\u2019t really have to say much if the conversation did not call for it, but I would personally say that when I was with friends that I\u2019ve grown to confide in as life went on, I grew to be more expressive around them but I usually felt like I couldn\u2019t fully open up to them.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI\u2019m pretty lost in terms of a career currently, as I don\u2019t really have a passion or motivation to pursue something indefinitely like I did in the past. When I was growing up, I felt like I wanted to work towards the medical field because I wanted to increase my knowledge within the field in order to help a better cause. I still have somewhat of an interest in that field, but I also have somewhat of an interest towards computer science and coding, due to its nature of applying logics and creating something with your own breadth of knowledge.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nIf I had to spend an entire weekend by myself, I would generally welcome that idea and scenario with open arms. Although I enjoy hanging out and being around people, I tend to get exhausted fast, as I need to recollect my thoughts and focus on activities that I would consider relaxing. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nThe activities I generally prefer are playing video games, researching random topics that pique my interest, and watching anime. Although I did multiple sports in the past including volleyball, tennis, and swimming, It wasn\u2019t all something that I generally wanted to do on my own accord. Nor was I really good at it. I mainly joined these sports because my friends pressured me to do so, and I felt like it would be interesting to be open to new ideas. Nevertheless, I was pretty trash at all those sports due to my tendency to not be as strong in foundational/basic skills, although I was good at improvising in the moment occasionally.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would consider myself to be a curious individual, as I tend to internalize my thoughts through what I pick up via external sources. I tend to NOT have more ideas than I can execute, because I generally want to focus within one goal that I\u2019ve consistently built upon. My ideas tend to be more conceptual, as I tend to apply more towards theories and how these theories can be used to support my ideas, possibly even creating my own perspective and theory on the topic.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t normally step up to take a leadership position in any circumstances, I like to have control over a situation whenever it is something that is important to me/that I value. I\u2019m unsure whether I would be good at it, but usually when I take a leadership position I like to measure our success based on how much time was spent, and how thorough it could be within that time. My leadership style tends to be that I would focus on what the end goal is, and work my way backwards in order to find the most efficient yet thorough steps in order to achieve the singular goal. I would still appreciate/welcome other people\u2019s ideas and plans, and try to integrate it within my plan if it fits within the general consensus and seems to be a \u201csturdy\u201d idea.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI feel that I am not as coordinated, because my mind tends to wander off a lot if it is not an activity that I am particularly invested in. I generally don\u2019t enjoy getting my hands dirty, but I would be willing to if it was something that I was interested to see the outcome of or if it was something that I was working towards for a goal.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI would say I am not the most artistic person, but I greatly value music. Music tends to allow me to connect to my own emotions much more efficiently, since I generally don\u2019t share these feelings externally. It helps me keep in touch with my emotions and be able to connect to the artist/singer without even knowing them directly, as well as my interpretation that music could have many different interpretations depending on how we could relate to it, which makes it the most enjoyable form of art for me.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nMy opinion of the past, present, and future mainly resides in the importance of the future because I like to be cautious and be fully prepared for my plans/goals to be as smooth as possible into the future. Although I don\u2019t really recall much of the past vividly into my everyday life, I generally tend to look upon what mistakes I have made before and my failures of the past, as to help prevent it from impacting as hard in the present/future. I tend to be extremely regretful and dwell on the past a lot regarding my actions and mistakes that have hurt other people, as it was not really my intention to do so. That would somewhat prove that the past could be equally as important, but I tend to put my focus more on the future and towards what I would plan to do.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nWhenever others request my help to do anything, I generally decide to help them if it is within my capabilities because I tend to imagine if I was in their place, and that I would want somebody to help me so I could finish whatever I was doing as well. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI value logical consistency in my life a lot, as I believe it is something that can create a personalized system of thoughts in order to move through life more smoothly. I feel that logical consistency is important when making a decision or creating a plan, but it should be quite important to consider whether or not it aligns within my values and morals.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIt is important to me to be efficient and productive even though I admittedly procrastinate like crazy, because it would ultimately save time for me to relax and focus on building a better understanding of the world and find hidden meanings within it as well. \n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nOthers have said towards me and I admit that I do control others even if indirectly. I generally am able to read others\u2019 intentions by pondering about the meaning of their actions, such as body language, speech, etc. This somewhat gives me an idea of the atmosphere I am in, and thus I tend to drive the situation to a more favorable environment such as something positive such as making them feel comfortable within the situation.I do this because\u2026 it just feels like the right thing to do.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMy hobbies include mainly playing video games, watching anime, reading manga, and researching topics that pique my interest to feed my brain. I enjoy these topics because for the first hobby, video games, it gives me time to spend with friends if I would like to, and have a fun time just relaxing overall. I tend to really enjoy watching anime and reading manga, specifically more towards dark fantasy or drama/tragedy genres, as it allows me to connect much more to the characters and get lost within their world. It\u2019s just overall an amazing experience to immerse myself within that atmosphere (even if it\u2019s tear jerking or dark) because I enjoy connecting and empathizing with these characters. It also ironically helps me find meaning within certain topics and life in general, as I believe fiction was created in order to tell lessons and morals through stories. Lastly I enjoy researching topics that pique my interest because I am a curious person who likes to feed my brain with, what other people would consider useless/unnecessary, knowledge but it helps me stabilize my logical consistencies and broaden my understanding of the \u201ctruth\u201d behind situations.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI tend to have a better learning style of absorbing information internally on my own, and verifying it with external sources. I feel that the learning environment I struggle with the most is likely fully asynchronous work/assignments, as I need some sort of feedback in order to verify my results. I prefer classes that revolve around creativity and logic, as I find it to be stimulating to be able to create a plan built upon your understanding of the topic, and be able to bring it into fruition. I would likely despise classes that involve my physical senses if it does not pique my interest.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI would say I am quite good at strategizing, as I tend to be able to visualize a specific goal, and be able to plan according to various info within the moment. Although I can\u2019t vocalize it well, I am able to easily break up projects into manageable and small tasks in order to focus on building a logically consistent process in order to result in the outcome. Although I am quite stubborn when it comes to my strategies and reluctant to change it due to my constant refinement of it, I am still open to improvising as I go since unknown variables are always an exception within problem solving and such.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nMy main aspirations in life professionally currently are to just mainly get into a field that piques my interest, and would ultimately allow me to consistently build on my knowledge and understanding of the world and contribute to a greater good. My aspirations in life personally? I just want to be happy and be able to share my visions with people.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy fears tend to be ignoring my hunches and understanding of others\u2019 emotions, because I tend to be able to understand their emotions but neglect it over the value of logical consistency. I also tend to fear not being competent or being incapable for the outside world, as I feel that everything should have a purpose and meaning. Embarrassingly, I also tend to fear abandonment and that I am unworthy of love due to my past regrets of hurting others through manipulating or neglecting their emotions even though I am aware of them. Although I would consider myself to be a deep feeler, being around people who are expressing strong emotions tends to make me uncomfortable because I feel I am not well suited to deal with these types of scenarios. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nAlthough it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had a \u201chigh\u201d in my life, from what I could remember it was a period where I was much more free of stress and had plenty of time to focus on myself and my hobbies.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nThe \u201clows\u201d in my life tend to be extremely unproductive, and may result in reckless actions as I tend to overeat, or barely eat whenever I am incredibly stressed or down.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI would say that I am not really attached to reality, because I tend to daydream A LOT and I idealize many different situations and dwell on the meaning with my thoughts. Generally, I am not aware of my surroundings WHILE I daydream but my daydreaming is usually based on the information I took from my surroundings.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI would likely start  thinking about certain topics and would drift off into a lot of \u201cWhat ifs\u201d because those generally tend to be more and more interesting the further you continue. I would probably continue this until I\u2019ve hit a wall and then realize that I am stuck in this empty room.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt takes me quite long to make an important decision because I like to be thorough and consider all the possibilities revolving around the decision, and being able to support it with logical consistencies. I tend to not change my mind once I\u2019ve made an important decision on my own, but I am prone to doubt my decision if someone were to bring up a very strong argument to change something.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nAlthough I am not very expressive of my emotions and don\u2019t fully rely on them to navigate the world, I view them to be important because it ultimately allows you to connect with others and be able to know what you want. It generally takes me a long time to process my emotions because I tend to analyze them for a long time to understand it, and how it affects myself/others.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes I catch myself agreeing with others just to keep whatever is happening going occasionally because even if I disagree with them, I would first weigh the importance of the discussion, whether or not it\u2019s worth intruding and stating my mind/the truth, as well as how it would affect the others. I feel that it would be much more efficient and smooth to just go with the flow and agree with others if it was not something to debate about, since it would ultimately keep the atmosphere intact.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI tend to respect rules when it matters to apply, but I tend to see authorities as a figure of equal status. I personally feel that even if they \u201cknow better\u201d than the rest of us, they should still treat everyone else as a normal person instead of abusing power. It\u2019s not necessarily challenging authority, but more of being more connectable with everyone else below/above you.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n20F, I just kinda hang out. Not sure what a general description should be like tbh. Let me look up some examples of that and I'll write something similar\nI just looked it up. I'm generally quiet irl, get told often I don't talk enough. Online though I can be a bit of a wildcard. Not sure why that is, I guess it's easier for me to be a crazy bastard online, I just don't have the energy irl lol. \nI'm generally kind though, I try not to be mean to people. I try to do things I enjoy and be the best at it. I'm responsible and I get things done well but I'm also extremely procrastinative (is that a word? Probably not lol). \n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNnnnnnaah? Maybe ADHD, depression and autism though those are just my own suspicions, I've never been diagnosed lmfao\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI mean naturally, being born in turkey you are raised in an Islamic environment. You are sort of taught to be more homophobic etc. But on hanging out on the internet ever since a very young age I taught myself against that. I'm not anti-islamic, I'd say I'm still a Muslim/believe there is some sort of greater force though the idea of an afterlife doesn't always sound so realistic to me. I think I might go a little off topic if I keep talking though. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don't really have a job. I just do what I'm good at freelance and get paid for it, which is art/design. I like it. I've been getting good amount of recognition recently so it's been motivating to keep making stuff. I make decent money (enough to buy a car, high spec PC parts and a couple other things I wanted) too so I'm more than happy with it. Best part is I get to sit at home and it's an easy job.  This sounds like I'm advertising being a freelance artist. Don't. You'll lose your soul\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nIt wouldn't be that bad, there is countless sources of entertainment especially if you have a PC. It's just 2 days. In fact I might have fun. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nActivities that are fun. Lmao. I suppose creating, video games, getting money, good grades. I like eating ice cream. What kind of activities are these? I think I could be good at sports if I wanted but I just don't feel like it brah. It's not that I can't, it's that I'd rather play video games and draw. \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm a pretty curious person yeah. I frequently have random questions in my head pop up and the only way I can satisfy that is by researching it or asking about it. I do have a lot of ideas but I won't say \"more than I can execute\", despite there being a lot of ideas I'm capable enough to make all of them. I'm just lazy :D but eventually I do execute all my plans, just, at my own rate. my curiosities are random as hell, I may have just been thinking deeper about something in particular and suddenly I notice something that I don't know about that thing so I research it and now I know. For example why a certain word is called the way it is. Maybe a foreign word I learned about but forgot. Maybe a formula I learned back in high school but can't remember. Or the reason why some cpus don't fit with certain motherboards. Random shit like that. Depends on what I'm thinking about. You tell me if these are conceptual or environmental, I don't know. I forget what I think about approx. A second later so, yeah. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI probably would yeah. I enjoy any challenge and leading would be a different experience to have fun with. I don't think I'd be too bad, because in the end my priority would be to achieve the best end result to the best of my abilities. I don't think I'd be extremely assertive but I wouldn't be super loose. But I would also wish people would be able capable by themselves as well so I wouldn't have to tell them every little thing. I might get a little tired after too much tho. \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nHmmmmmm. I'm probably not the most coordinated. I can be a little ditzy sometimes and even end up putting the salt shaker in my soup instead of the spoon. But I have good reflexes... And my hands are skilled. Maybe it's because I'm an artist. \n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI'm an artist and make art so I am artistic I suppose, yeah. I like to make art of characters I find cool and try to portray them how I see them. People call my art elegant, well drawn, etc. They simp for it which is my favorite type of reaction lol.  \n\nOh my god this questionnaire is long. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI ignore the past. What happened has happened and there isn't much meaning in thinking about it a lot. I do like looking upon good memories fondly tho. Present is most important to me but future is close second. I used to be really concerned with the future when I was younger but as I grew up I started to learn to appreciate the present and live it to the fullest by doing things I enjoy. Whatever will happen in the future will happen, all I need to do is do things well so that the outcome will be good. \n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI'll help, especially if it's something easy. If it's something hard/risky I will be hesitant/won't help. Me before others, unfortunately. Except for my family. I'd do everything for my family. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nOf course. If there wasn't I'd feel uncomfortable.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hi, I hope this does not get too long, sorry. I tend to get carried away and talk too much.\n\nI read the sample questionnaire, but wow. I am not sure I can even answer a lot of those, and would take a really long time! I posted the following in the MBTI subreddit, and they said to post over here. I am being lazy and just reposting, sorry. If people have a glance and say, uh, no, do something else (including trying the questionnaire!) I will have a go at that. No hard feelings at being told what i have here is inappropriate!\n\nI have spent like 30 years trying to figure out my type. I have taken the official MBTI several times over the years, including the more in-depth versions, and ofc have taken a shit load of the online ones, even some paid ones. I am pretty clearly NF, but can be somewhat close on I/E and on P/J, which means that several different types pop up.\n\nRecently I came across some Function tests, some rec'd from here and some from other MB forums/Discords. Not useful, but I guess no surprise based on the closeness of my I/E and P/J scores on the regular tests: Fe and Fi were almost the same, and Ne and Ni were almost the same. With the regular tests (don't know what those are called) I always come out at INFP, but on the functional tests I come out as ENFP on top (no surprise, still Ne and Fi), followed by INFP and then with ENFJ and INFJ and even ESFJ all barely separated.\n\nI am happy to take any tests that people here feel would be relevant and post the results here.\n\nThe thing is, although I hate crowds and have a very low need for going out, am very happy to entertain myself reading or surfing the internet or spending time with my wife and our pets, I sing out loud all the time, talk to myself out loud all the time (esp complaining) and can be very outgoing, esp 1:1. I do not seek out new people but when meeting someone new, depending on the circumstances I can swap life stories. All the type descriptions I have read of Is say they are quiet and somewhat withdrawn, so I seem to be more extroverted, I dunno. Also, when I was little I was constantly criticized by my family for talking too much and by some of them for singing all the time. So seems I was extroverted when I was little.\n\nFor the Feeling component, I do care a lot about other people's feeling and am very sensitive to that. I will ask people if they are ok and mean it, lol. And use reflective listening if they want to talk, and also share personal stuff if I feel it can make a connection with them. That seems really Fe.\n\nHowever, I have a strong tech side, I am a biochemist and can understand science really well. I am also not at all creative. I am very imaginative and have endless daydreams and fantasies (which leads me to making a LOT of careless mistakes, though thinking about situation and how I feel about them and stuff leads to that too).\n\nAlso, esp when I was young, I definitely would engage in conflict to some degree. I argued with my grandfather a lot in my teens. OMFG he was soooo rigid!! We did NOT get along. I know now he was a strong ISTJ btw. I could be very hard and harsh, and honestly still can. Also, I walk away from relationships if I feel hurt and feel that talking about it anymore will not help. I have ghosted people a lot.\n\nOh, and also when I was young, from puberty until probably through my mid 20's, I tried on a LOT of personas trying to figure out who I was. In grad school (mid-20s) I even tested as an INTJ. Which, I dunno, maybe I am and I just do not want to be that way so cheat on the MB evaluations. I have spent my whole life though trying to figure out who I am and what I am and what I should do in life and what the meaning of life is, and all that. Has driven me crazy, and at 63 gave up years ago on even figuring it out. Honestly I feel even if I did now it doesn't matter, just too late.\n\nAnyhow, I know this was long. I am happy to hear any suggestions anyone has, or to answer any questions.\n\nThanks!\n\ncaerolle :)", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Just the title\u2026 I\u2019m very torn on whether I\u2019m a Ti dom, or an Fi dom. \n\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m quite knowledgeable, I like watching videos on subjects that interest me and I have a \u201cframework\u201d that I use very very frequently on a day to day basis, I often make assumptions as to how things work based on other facts I know. But I think this is honestly my Ne working rather than my Ti.\n\nI know someone who is an Fi dominant, and they\u2019re much more accepting of their feelings than I am. When we discuss philosophy they will gladly accept the notion of \u201cI just feel that way\u201d, they\u2019re fine accepting their subjective interpretation of something, not as truth necessarily but as something they hold dear.\n\nIn some ways I feel this too! I really do. I often make strong judgements, they\u2019re not really all about my feelings though but I think just me being an individual\u2026\n\nLike I came up with this analogy, my analogy was if someone put a gun to my head and ordered me to do an extremely simple task or else I die - I mean there is literally no downside to completing this task, it is something as simple as touching whatever is in front of you. It would seem the most rational choice (assuming you value your life) to just touch the thing, I mean there is basically no downside or sacrifice to it and you get to keep living. But, because the benefits and trade off of touching the wall greatly outweighs the other decision - not touching it and dying - there is no reason for you not to touch it. And therefore it feels like you\u2019re not even making a decision, just your circumstance is for you. I find beauty in this. Not necessarily not touching the wall, but the rebellion, the immensity of the attempt. But I find even more beauty in projecting that same passion as you tried to resist, into accepting your fate.\n\nSee that\u2019s what makes me think I\u2019m Fi.\n\nYet, I feel more Ti at times? I am disgusted sometimes at feelings. I struggle to be vulnerable with literally everyone except one person\u2026 and I often seem outbursts of passion as\u2026 just confusing? I have an objective view of things at times that makes it hard for me to fully resonate with those that judge everything on emotion. I often find myself just disgusted at humans and wondering what even makes us different from robots? Emotions\u2026 but emotions at the end of the day is just math\u2026 so\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m not amazing at accepting the human condition and it\u2019s tough for me to believe that life is just about \u201cbeing happy\u201d, I\u2019m kind of torn between a logical stance and an emotional one. \n\nAny help would be appreciated greatly\u2026", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "&#x200B;\n\n* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nIm 23, male from Europe, not very tall and slim (my metabolism be fast af), generally lazy and trying to enjoy life. I wear mostly black clothes and jeans and used to paint my nails black because I'm emo/goth lol.\n\n* **Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNo, but I feel like I might have ADHD since I always fidget with random stuff and I was also severely depressed (borderline suicidal) when I was 16 but haven't had those thoughts since then.\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was kind of erratic in the sense that my parents didn't really have much time for me and when I was very young I had abandonment issues and would cry in the kindergarten because the kids were mostly annoying. My grandma would take me to a local internet cafe where I would spend my time playing video games aside from watching cartoons. She also took me to church a couple times when I was a kid but I would just play with the other kids and there were also toys on the first floor, I never really understood it and I feel like I've always been an atheist.\n\nMy parents are very odd type of people - my father lives in the past and when I was little, we would just watch the same movies and stuff over and over but eventually I grew out of that and I look for something novel, for example I can't watch the same movies more than 1-2 times.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI graduated computer science this year and currently work as a junior software developer in the DevOps field and I do like it though my impostor syndrome kicks off quite a lot. Yesterday we started working on a project and I was the main dude working on the terminal and had the other 3 developers whine about every little error I make or that I'm being \"too fast\" to write stuff as if I have 0 clue what I'm doing, it kind of felt like I'm taking a technical interview. Other than that it's pretty chill, people are mostly nice except my manager. I won a hackathon that was hosted by the university and he decided that he would assign me to a project that's beyond my capabilities so there's high expectations. I just hope I don't burn out or I get fired for the time being, since I'm still a newcomer.\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel refreshed for sure. I just clock out at 6pm from work and do my stuff, maybe cook something or watch anime and talk to my girlfriend and maybe play some games then go sleep. It does get lonely since I don't have a lot of friends but my girlfriend and my best friend make up for it, for the most part.\n\n* **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI wouldn't say I'm good at sports, though I did enjoy playing basketball at high school and university. I also used to be somewhat decent as a goalkeeper in high school but only for the P.E. classes, nothing beyond that. I never wanted to go to a competition or whatever. However I've always wanted to do some kind of martials arts like muay thai but I never took the chance to since I get lazy very easily and I feel it it would drain me mentally even more. I used to get in fights in high school with friends but I'm not really the violent type since everything can be resolved by using words, e.g diplomatically. I see violence as a final resort, in general.\n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nAlthough I see myself as a curious person, I tend to filter some information nowadays that simply does not interest me, such as news or fashion or whatever it may be, if I'm interested in it, I will research as much as I want/will. I do have a lot of ideas/theories but those are more correlated to like conspiracies or unpopular opinions. I feel like most people have no ability to think for themselves and just become sheep just to appeal to society's standards.\n\nI'm curious about history, astronomy/space, tech, video games, scenarios that could or may not happen like \"what if\" scenarios. I space out quite a lot when I'm watching anime or doing whatever, I get lost in thought easily.\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI think I would take a leadership position if there's no one else to take the initiative but normally if there's someone that is already knowledgeable and worthy to be a leader, I'd follow him. I wouldn't want to be a leader for as long as if I have to. I feel like my leadership style would be to reach the objective we've set. When I was in university I hated project assignments because I would have to manage everything usually and I'd rather just do it myself at that point. If I can do it on my own then I'm gonna do it on my own.\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not really coordinated, sometimes when I'm outside and thinking about stuff I zone out and I trip on the street or when I'm at home I often times eat while I'm moving back and forth because I'm thinking about something, I forget my surroundings a lot. One time I had to run an errand for my mother and I couldn't find my wallet even though I looked pretty much everywhere that I could think of and then once I went to the store with the jacket I normally wore at the time it was apparently in my pocket the entire time...Also when I forget stuff like if I forget where my phone or keys are I try to rewind to where I went or what I did most recently and track my actions to find where something is. I don't really enjoy working with my hands because I am anxious and stability is not one of my core strengths which is probably why I would never be a photographer or something.\n\n* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI used to draw when I was younger and I was somewhat good at it but I never really saw it something \"deep\" or impressive. I just drew whatever I could picture that would look cool but I find art, especially nowadays to be ambiguous as in modern art is not really art-art. I mean c'mon, a banana taped to a wall is art now? Or hell those artists that spin around a bucket over a canvas and call it a day...yeah no. I like Salvador Dali because his art is not visually appealing to the eye but I also find it abstract.\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe Past: I try not to look into the past often unless it's for nostalgia reasons, I associate it with troubles or mistakes or whatever in that regard otherwise. When I think of the past in general I see it as what has shaped me into the person that I currently am and try not to dwell too much on it since it's already gone and it doesn't help me at all.\n\nThe Present: I see it as the opportunities that I can either seize or choose not to. Everything is constantly changing and it makes me excited for new things to have because everyday is something novel especially since I work in tech. But not only that, people/news/articles and everything change right by second so it's constant and sometimes I find it exhausting if anything.\n\nThe Future: It changes depends on how I feel, however for the most part I see it as a dystopia, even though some parts may be good about it. For example, in the future most stuff we do or that people used to do will be automated by machines, one way or another. Which would lead to a larger recession that we currently have, however the mentality of people might also change to make them strive to do better instead of relying on robots to do everything for them. I get FOMO a lot, especially about space, things that I would never witness, such as Andromeda colliding with our universe or Mount Rushmore ceasing to exist or whatever. There's a reason why I used to watch Vsauce so much, not because of the great information he delivers but also because the topics were very interesting even if one could not experience them thoroughly. For me personally, I want to become an expert in my field and hopefully have a family, visit some countries, etc. I have always wanted to visit Egypt and Japan and it's part of my many dreams.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIt depends on what they're asking me to do and who is asking me to do it. If it's at work obviously I will do it but depending on whether it's a friend or not I could just say \"nah\" or \"idk im too busy\" but then if they try to still force it upon me I might slack off on purpose or just forget to do it. If I decide to help someone I would do it because I deem them important and it also depends again on what \"help\" is meant, it could mean anything. I love helping with providing information but I try not to get physical when I have to or with advice.\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nBeing logical is what I try to do most of the time, though I second guess myself a lot because one solution could always be worse/better than another solution later on. What I mean is, one shouldn't immediately call it a day once a solution has been found, unless there's no other solution to be thought of. I try to be practical with my decisions, even though sometimes I buy stuff that I don't necessarily need but I still get them because they give me a sense of thrill.\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI try to be productive and I don't like postponing or delaying too much because it makes me very anxious as in that I won't be able to do it in time. If I can do it early and have it gone out of my head then that's great. I don't want to be seen as incompetent so I strive to learn as much as I can and apply it in practice where possible.\n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI wouldn't say I control others but I may or may not have indirectly manipulated someone without me knowing. I'm not really a bossy type though, if I can do something then I'll do it myself. I wouldn't really ask someone to run an errand for me unless I have a medical problem or idk.\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy hobbies are playing video games, listening to music, watching anime/vids. I like them because they make me relax and I don't have to think as much or at all when doing them, unless I'm playing a tactical shooter or a strategy game, such as chess or w/e. I loved metal construction sets as a kid and tinkering with random stuff, because every new thing I haven't touched before was interesting to me.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI'm mostly a visual learner using logic and memory, kind of, though mostly for things I'm genuinely interested in. I learn by doing and by seeing stuff and memorizing a ton of details and the likes is not one of my core strengths. I could remember stuff from years ago that actually interested me, such as a random fact/equation/quote, etc. but stuff that I dislike and didn't find enjoyable doesn't stick with me.\n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nNo, I don't strategize I just go with the flow and see what happens, I don't plan because that drains me mentally and if I could get by without planning I will. I would definitely say I wing projects and improvise, well I improvise at whatever I can, actually.\n\n* **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nAs I mentioned before, I want to become a professional in my field of work and personally I just want to enjoy life and experience new things before it I'm gone.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI have FOMO (as mentioned) and being alone, I guess. People that are too touchy make me uncomfortable, people that talk too loud around me, people initiating conversations with me without me knowing them. I hate idiots, people that can't think for themselves, loud people, smartasses, normies, arguing for the sake of arguing, in fact I avoid arguments whenever I can. Well, I hate them simply because I cannot get along with them easily, most of my friends are people that understand me quite easily and I tend to filter people based on that.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nBeing able to say whatever I want without having to censor myself, having fun, talking about my interests, doing my hobbies, learning new stuff, etc.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nAnxiety, low self esteem, impostor syndrome. Sometimes I have no motivation to brush my teeth or I tend to oversleep / not sleep enough. I also become anxious about the future, I get thoughts, what if I get fired, what if then this that and I spiral but not for long periods of time, but it happens. I have frequent mood swings and normally I just got the bitch resting face.\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI don't really daydream much but when I do I don't pay attention to my surroundings and I just go \"uh?\" or \"sorry i spaced out\", I am not aware of my surroundings and even with simple tasks like taking out the trash I would keep going straight while I'm thinking and would have to remind myself that the garbage bin I skipped while I'm moving and I appear like an idiot.\n\n* **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI would look for a way to escape because I'm not staying in an empty room for more than an hour or so, I would get claustrophobic eventually and would instinctively attempt to break out on my own. Having no one to talk to or nothing to do is one the things I hate.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI consider all the possibilities of that option that I choose. It works kind of like the butterfly effect, like if I take option A1 it could lead to B1 then C1 then D1 and if I take option A2 it could lead to B1 C2 and something like that, I try to look for that option that correlates with what I want to achieve and more often than not I roll with it even though I'm never 100% sure about it. I do change my mind a lot since I might find a better option than the former later on.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI don't really understand my emotions and usually I feel like a robot because I don't get strong feelings at all. The emotional stances are like laughter, crying and the usual blank face. I find my emotions annoying and tend to ignore them and bottle them up whenever I can, until they explode on me.\n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNo, I don't see why I should agree with someone just to make them feel better. If I am 99% sure I am right about something and I've thought it in my head I wouldn't mind escalating it into a debate to see their POV, because there be a 1% chance that I could be wrong. I look for logical inconsistencies in people's points and arguments and I am quick to point them out, then they get upset.\n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't break rules often solely because I want to have a peaceful life, in fact being in jail is one of the things that I fear and I hope never happens to me. I would say authority as a whole is complex topic to talk about because society as we have it, can never be perfect no matter what the circumstances are. People will always abuse their power and there's always going to be people to break rules, and that's probably why life is fun in that sense, if everyone abided by the rules and people didn't abuse their power, the world would be dull. Some people would do go to the extremes to commit a crime, just to seem cool. On the other hand, some people get an authority position just to accumulate more wealth and just life off telling people lies. I have broken rules as well but it hasn't hurt anyone so it shouldn't be a big deal, though I don't break them often if at all, in reality.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Been wondering for so long and yet when I think I'm one, I choose another, and the cycle repeats.\n\nI'll start off by giving a general description of myself\n\nGenerally I am perceived as quiet, and that is true. Like my friend (ENFP) said, I overthink, but not necessarily overthink in my opinion, just my attempt in creating precautions to REASONABLE possibilities. When making a decision, I am generally focused on what is important and makes sense, rather than what will make others happy. I still try to do the right thing, but I focus more on what is in my opinion, the fairest answer, without being biased. Aside from that, as to the overthinking, I believe it is my skepticism towards everyone and everything. I usually come to assumptions of things that might happen and why it will happen. Generally, these assumptions come from behaviors I have seen from a certain person that occurs often or regularly. I personally believe I am an INTP or INTJ, I know the functions are different, but I resonate with most of the functions of both types, EXCEPT Si.", "clean_guess": "INTJ", "llm_guess": " INTJ", "logprobs": []}

The question form was long..\n\n\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n-Im 17 and im a girl. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career ? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n-Im still in high school and i hate it, its boring, it takes all my time, i dont have any real friends there, (only people i stay with not to be alone, but theres no one i feel really close to) \n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel?\n-I would love it because i could do whatever i want and make progress in my projects \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n-I like running.

What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n-I am very curious about a lot of things. I like to learn about anything. I do have a lot of ideas too, mostly conceptual i'd say.\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n-I dont really like it because i dont like having responsabilites. And i dont really like helping people either. So i would probably not be good at it. If i had to do it i would only care about what concerns me and let the others organize themselves. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n-I try to ignore anything but the present, but i often worry about the future. The past makes me nostalgic.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n-If i have to help someone I'll do it.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n-Yes \n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n-Its very important.

How and why do you do that?\n-I do not care about controlling other people\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n-I learn by assossiating new things with things i already know. The learning environnement i struggle with the most is school. I dont think its stimulating and its imposing too many things that blocks freedom. I dont like any classes.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n-Im good at it but i only strategize for my personal \nproject. Anything that isnt related to it I'll just improvise.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n-I want to be able to live by doing my passion. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n-My fear is to not enjoy living. I hate having to do things i dont want to do. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n-When i get closer to my goal\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n-When im doubting about everything \n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n-I daydream often because i always think about the world i've created in my head, with my characters and all. However im still very aware of everything around me and i look very down to earth. \n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n- I think about when I'll get out and also about my manga. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n- I dont take a lot of time. Most of the time i know what i want. But i can change my mind if im presented new things that i like better. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n-It is pretty fast. I acknowledge them and get where they're from, then deal with it. I dont consider them very important \n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n-It happens sometimes. I do that to avoid dealing with conflicts or just to make the situation simpler.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n-Somtimes. I like taking risks to reach my goals. Most of the time i also believe that if i have good reason to do something then I'll do it even if its against something.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hey everyone,\n\nAppreciate you all for sticking with this probably long post. Didn't share a photo since personally after constant research of the functions, typing off superficial appearance and quirks seems sort of irrational(no offense to those just having fun here).\n\nWhen I first tested as a teenager in high school, I scored an ENTP. Then in college I was an ISTP. Looking back in hindsight, that ISTP score was more male ego aspiration bias because it sounded cool and logical. In recent weeks when taking the test it came out INFP.\n\nWith better introspection, I realize that I used to low-key dread the idea of being a feeler. Society tends to not take people seriously that prioritize feeling based rationale, especially with sexist expectations of men being the cold logical ones. Now in my mid to late 20's, I've matured into appreciating taking feelings into account and seeing the differing ethical perspectives.\n\nThat said, not exactly sure if INFP would be correct either. I definitely have used Fe most of my life because I was the \"gentlemanly polite kid\" in my family often reading the room to act accordingly. In general, I hate social faux pas and rude drama, it makes me very uncomfortable, hence I morph myself to ensure the least amount of tension in varying contexts. That said, I will subtely change conversations or have people in my good graces so that I could control the flow to my preference. \n\nIronically, while I know to read the room and do enjoy theoretically empathizing with people's perspectives, I'm very very awkward when it comes to consoling grieving people. Hence my strategic mentality is to make sure everyone is content so I don't freeze up and look like an a-hole ineptly dealing with their raw emotional fallout. I like the idea of helping humanity, but being face to face with real humans with raw emotion is yeah... nope.\n\nOn the other hand, I also realize my \"logical persona\" I built for myself wasn't so logical. Yes it annoys me when people throw truth out the window in their arguments, but even I don't seek out logic for logic's sake. Usually I have some motivational daydream idea that inspires me to research information to better build my understanding of something. Obviously I want the truth and do refine my analytical research to reach that, but the initial spark was some illogical daydream. \n\nFor example, I studied History in university, the connection to humanity and the rigorous interpretive analysis drew me to the field. In contrast, sciences and technology bores me unless I could daydream about how it applied to humanity. \n\nAnother example is when I initially tried to apply for project manager positions at hospitals after graduation. My mind was excited about the idea of leading a team that contributed to society's health. But reality eventually hit that wait a minute, I hate checklists and micromanaging reports. I've managed teams before, but always laying out a broad picture set into general objectives, delegating to people and trusting they can complete goals using whatever means. I hate micromanaging, excel reports, and other minutiae.\n\nAnyway, I've probably meandered long enough. I'd appreciate any insight on this. I am much more accepting to the idea of being a feeler nowadays.\n\nHelp?", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Help typing me\n\nHelp typing myself\r\n\r\nI've been kinda' obsessed with MBTI over the past few months. Really anything to do with personality tests or insights about myself usually intrigue me. \r\n\r\nI've been stuck on my type as 16 types to go back n' forth on is driving me nuts lmao. Gonna' write somethings about myself and see what you guys think.\r\n\r\nMy core values are:  Freedom, Authenticity, Open mindedness, Courage, Friends/Family. \r\n\r\nEven though I send a lot of time trying to 'find myself', I notice that in social situations, I'm different depending on the group. My parents for instance, see me as a quiet, to myself person that they never know what I'm thinking or feeling.\r\n\r\nMy friends on the other hand, see me as a bubbly, outgoing, weirdo who probably over shares and is always talking about something. \r\n\r\nTemper wise, I've always had loose control on my feelings. From when I was a child, the littlest things would set me off and I embarrassingly admit that being 23, things haven't gotten much better for me in that department. \r\n\r\nMy dream when I was younger and to this day is to be a professional wrestler/actor. I love the idea of playing a different role, story telling, and the added bonus of the crowd going crazy from you doing an insane move in the ring, lmao. \r\n\r\nMy biggest fear is that one day I'll wake up, and it'll be too late to do all the things I've wanted to. I guess I'm really afraid of letting fear rule my life. \r\n\r\nI'm a BIG procrastinator. I'll usually wait, wasting time on things I find enjoyable until the absolute last minute when I have to rush. \r\n\r\nQuotes/sayings that I resonate with the most are:\r\n\r\n\"Memento Mori\", which is a latin phrase that essentially means \"remember you must die\". It reminds us to live our lives with the thought in mind that every day could be our last.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is I love being alive. And I love feeling free. So if I can't have those things then I feel like a caged animal and I'd rather not be in a cage. I'd rather be dead.\" a quote by actress, Angelina Jolie. \r\n\r\nGoing more in depth about each point:\r\n\r\nFreedom/Authenticity - For me, freedom is the ability to do, say, dress, and be who you are without letting the opinions of society influence you in any way. I also see it as the mastery of fear, something that I've had trouble with for a while. I value it because i feel it's the most natural way for us as humans to live. When we're born, we only obtain anxiety and fear by noticing more and more things in society and having more expectations placed on us. While I don't wish to necessarily be free of obligations, i do wish to be mentally free in spite of them.\r\n\r\nCourage - Courage is a big deal for me because I'm always in my head about things. I feel if we just DO things, life would be a lot simpler. I want to get to a point where I focus on things I can control as opposed to things that I can't. \r\n\r\nFriends/Family - When im with people I'm comfortable with, i feel the most free and powerful. I thrive off the energy of being with and around people who accept me for who I am and want to make them feel as comfortable and heard as I am.\r\n\r\nDifferent around different people - A fear of rejection? I think I've come up with so many scenarios in my head about what people's reaction would be that if I'm not comfortable around you or feel you'd not accept me, I'd prefer to not say anything at all.\r\n\r\nTemperament - Mostly coming from things I can't do that I feel i should be good at either because they're simple, or I've spent enough time on them to be good at them. Maybe an ego thing? I've never liked losing or feeling like I'm not as good as someone. \r\n\r\nBe a different person - I think acting is a good outlet to experiment different parts of yourself while also getting to live out someone else's life. I think being the same person all the time is boring and I'd love to be a different gender or race if only for a week.\r\n\r\nCrowd - I love the rush I imagine you'd get from people either cheering, or boo'ing you. Being completely in the moment and having everyone hang on your every taunt and move, not knowing if you're gonna win or lose, seems like peak excitement and living to me.\r\n\r\nWorst fear - If a situation occurred, I'd probably spend my remaining time doing everything I can. Which is my fear. That it would take something life threatening to finally live fully.\r\n\r\nProcrastination - Truthfully, i can handle negative experiences as long as i feel it's worth it (working out, for instance), but when it's something i desperately don't wanna do, I'll find any reason not to.\r\n\r\nlive like it's your last - because at the end of the day, nothing matters and the thing your hung up on won't be important in the long run.\r\n\r\nI'm open to answering any follow up questions, thanks in advance to anyone who reads", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Ever since I got into MBTI, I could never decide whether I am ENTJ or ENFJ. It's like I constantly vary between the two types and I can't figure out my dominant function. I am definitely ENxJ tho, it's just that I can't figure out which one I am. So I'm posting this here in case someone could help me figure it out\n\nHere's a little info about me:\n\n\n**ENTJ traits**\n\n-I'm a natural leader and often the first one to take a stand for something \n\n-I can be pretty assertive and bossy in projects, but not in a negative way, I'm just a good coordinator and people generally listen to me and do great when I'm the one in charge\n\n-I'm pretty \"cold-hearted\" overall and not easily affected by sad stories and certain emotional things. I rarely cry at something that's not happening to me, or something where I'm not involved \n\n-I can be manipulative and machiavellian when it comes to achieving goals, using people, but only when it's absolutely necessary. Basically I sometimes manipulate people around me to do things for me, but that's where I draw the line, I'm not really like the stereotypical \"entj evil psychopath\" who sees people as pawns tho\n\n-I have a tendency to be in control of everything that happens in my life and can get pretty upset by setbacks. I value order and organization\n\n-I have a strong set of values that I never break, even tho I think of myself as a morally ambiguous person, there are certain things I deem unacceptable and would never do, and frown upon everybody who does it\n\n-I'm very success oriented, and one of my main goals is to be rich and high in the corporate world\n\n-This is very stereotypical, but I kinda have this internal obsession with power. I don't really behave like this, but I love being in position of giving orders, being the main member of the group, being the center of attention etc. etc. \n\n\n**ENFJ traits**\n\n-I am a very open and friendly person to everybody I meet, stranger or not and can empathize easily with everyone I talk with \n\n-I love solving people's problems in general, offering advice and sometimes going overboard with helping them, prioritizing them over myself\n\n-When it comes to friendships, I am always the therapist type of friend to everyone and everyone says I give the best advice \n\n-When it comes to love, I get attached very deeply and quite often fall in love with people that have \"issues\" or need \"fixing\" \n\n-I subconsciously \"alter\" my personality around people, think like the chameleon effect, and can fit in pretty much with any group\n\n-Even though I'm pretty success driven as I mentioned before, most of my goals in life involve relationships. I value friendships deeply and I'm always looking for \"that special someone\"\n\n-Even if I would call myself \"logical\", I kinda always follow my heart in the end when making decisions. I rarely actually do the logical and rational thing and always do what I feel like doing\n\n\n**Cognitive functions**\n\nI am definitely a Ni user, that's 100% but I can't figure out my dominant function.

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am 21 years old, female. Introverted, I love being on my own and get mentally drained rather easily. Zero friends here; I struggle with maintaining relationships mainly because I lose interest fairly quickly in - everything, really. But then, I can\u2018t say I\u2018ve met friends for life yet and haven\u2018t been fortunate with the people coming into my life. Other than that, I like reading, playing video games, researching about my latest hyperfixation\u2026 and I like being mentally stimulated.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNot that I know of. \n\n\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nSome slight religious influence, yes. I liked growing up and believing in something bigger than myself; I need purpose and meaning and my belief in an omnipotent being - God - helps with that. A lack of purpose has already led me to experience an existential crisis. It helps with my moral compass, too.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel?

What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious, I\u2018d say. Sometimes it\u2018s a directionless kind of curiosity; I\u2018m curious for the sake of being curious, for the sake of learning, I suppose? Whether it\u2018s philosophic concepts, the anatomy of the human body, the human psyche or something as abstract as spirituality, too. Anything that I can possibly learn from, that can help me grow in whatever way, is something I\u2018m curious about.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nHonestly, I\u2018m not sure. I think I\u2018m lacking the self-awareness needed to answer this question. I\u2018m neither follower nor leader, I don\u2018t like leading and I don\u2018t like being led.\n\n\n \n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nTo a degree, maybe. I like writing poetry when the inspiration strikes me. My poetry\u2018s of the triste, melancholic kind. It\u2018s the only way of expressing myself, my way of being vulnerable, if you could say that. I don\u2018t like confiding in others, so when I feel like I need to vent or express emotional distress, I write it down in forms of tragic poetry but only when I feel compelled to do so. Other times, I simply keep to myself.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past, present and future\u2026 Sometimes it feels like they all exist simultaneously. I think a lot about all three. Pondering over what happened, thinking about what I could have changed or what could have been different if things went this or that way\u2026 Pointless questioning, but I can\u2018t help it.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI\u2018d feel obliged to help. Used to be a very anxious people pleaser back then, but I no longer feel like conforming to that past self of mine since I got taken advantage of. In the end it depends on what they\u2019re asking for.

Or does my complete unawareness of myself sometimes lower the credibility of having high Fi ? \n* Or maybe I don\u2019t notice my Fi because it\u2019s so second nature to me so I don\u2019t notice that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing?? But it could that I\u2019m just an a Ne dom bc Fi should probably know? Or does me thinking too hard about what I feel mean I\u2019m more Fi  ?!?!\n* I\u2019m not as authentic when speaking to or hanging out with others, there\u2019s always some kind of barrier no matter how close I am to someone that I simply cannot bring down no matter how hard I try and it\u2019s *exhausting*. I feel like I\u2019m performing and can\u2019t stop (tbf I\u2019m also neurodivergent)\n* I\u2019m a sucker for attention and entertaining others, I will purposefully do things to make people either laugh at what I\u2019m saying or laugh at me. \n* I crave to be original and unique, I eat \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc up \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc when people tell me they\u2018ve never met anyone like me, but at the same time loathe being misunderstood. \n\n  \nTi vs Te\n\n* I struggle to see the Te in me ever, even Te vs Ti questions have me stumped because I have no idea what I do, or if I do them at all.\n* Not sure if this relates, but I do this thing where I kind of **need** a rule of some kind to something, even if small, just so I understand the parameters\u2014 or if something doesn\u2019t have any written rules but has a pattern, I feel the need to vaguely follow that pattern or I feel I might do something wrong. \n*  I\u2019m also always very open to new ideas or concepts to expand my worldview, so I never see anything quite as set in stone.\n* Sometimes when I\u2019m watching or taking in something I don\u2019t form an opinion on it until I see the discourse in the comments and form my own opinion from that \n* or I\u2019ll see something, have a sudden opinion on it, then scavenge for a likeminded person in the comments \n* I know Te is described to be objective and I see myself as a pretty objective person, but I also notice I tend to inject subjectivity into my objectiveness. So. I have no idea. \n* when explaining why I think the way I do I\u2019ll explain my interworkings or my values or logic behind anything I do or believe in, to explain myself and my viewpoint (could be Fi?)  \n", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Thought I was an INTP 5w6 for the past 2 years I\u2019ve been into typology.

{"submission": "Part 1/2\n\n-Intro-\n\nThe pinned post on this community by the Mods have probably the best questions I've seen as a typing guide, so thank you Mods. XD \n\nAlso, if you try to type me, thank you for giving your time~  Here's a virtual cookie from me:\n\n\ud83c\udf6a\n\nI'll give a virtual taco at the conclusion. \n\n-1-\n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n     28yo. Sex: female. Gender: non-binary. General description...uhhh. Asian. Give off a \"cute\" vibe, have been compared to an anime character on some occasions. No I'm not Japanese, I'm Filipina, but I grew up in Japan as a navy brat.\n\n-2-\n\nIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\n     Lol. XD  Depression, anxiety, c-PTSD. I'm taking Paxil, an SSRI that treats all three rather than just one.  \n\n-3-\n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\n     My dad does believe in god but has no religion. So long as it doesn't encroach on his way of life, he kind of allows my mom to enforce her beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. Being a JW means no celebration of holidays, including birthdays and Christmas, so that's how I grew up.\n\n     Personally, I am an agnostic atheist. I try to be respectful to the concept of religion, as I recognize its necessity in getting humans to where they are today. But I'm unable to feel \"connected\" to a higher being the way my mom does, nor do I find human creation via god as the \"only logical explanation\" the way my dad does.  \n\n-4-\n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n     I'm a nurse. I do love my job. I work at memory care and assisted living right now. I plan to go back to school to get my RN. And while I like making a difference in my residents' lives, giving them a reason to smile and making them feel safe in scary situations--what I really like is feeling competent and reliable.\n\n-5-\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n     Refreshed. I'm fine with spending time with others. I can be excitable and hyper, but in the end, its draining and I get to a point where I'm just acting excitable and hyper. Being alone, focusing on myself, doing what I want to do without worrying about others, is how I recharge my energy levels back to baseline.  \n\n-6-\n\nWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n     I like writing.  Whether it's stories, my thoughts on things, responses to others...writing. \n\n     I fkkn suck at sports, I cheated on my mile run in 1ST GRADE because I sucked so bad at it.  XD \n\n     As for other activities...mmn, reading webtoons/manga.  Reading/writing fanfiction. And listening to YouTube videos. Tibees, Kurzgesagt, Macdoesit, LittleKuriboh. Oh and yes, Frank James lol.  Things like that.  \n\n-7-\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n     Yes I'm curious about things. I love learning as much as I am capable of understanding on the subjects. Some of my curiosities include the fourth dimension (i.e. Klein bottles) or how we could all be living before the Great Filter, which morbidly amuses me.  \n\n     As for ideas, yes, I have many ideas when regarding stories I want to write. More than I can ever write. They are conceptual ideas. The genres my ideas revolve around are romance and soft sci-fi. For soft sci-fi, I define that as stories along a similar vein of Everything, Everywhere, All At Once (my all time fave movie).\n\n-8-\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n     Would I enjoy? In the larger scheme of things, yes, because I like the thought of guiding individuals into being a cohesive unit while preserving their strengths, then using that to accomplish a project or mission.\n\n     Do I think I'd be good at it?  I think I'd try every day, as a leader, to be a good one unless the team requires something I cannot provide. \n\n     My leadership style?  If I were to choose one, it's most likely be Democratic under the Goleman leadership styles.\n\n-9-\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n     Like...motor gross skills and hand eye coordination?  Pfft I suck at both, esp hand eye coordination. I can be good with free or interpretive body movement.  But coordinated movements found in gaming or sports does not come naturally to me.\n\n     As for working with my hands...mmn, yes I enjoy it, but only to learn about what I'm working on or to feel accomplished upon succeeding. All in all, it's satisfying to know I was able to succeed in tasks at intermediate and above levels. Think putting in an IV line or debriding a pressure ulcer.  \n\n-10-\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n     Nope!  I can draw basic stuff, like eyes or Gudetama (after practice and careful line-arting). I can appreciate art and I'm good at interpreting it, but it doesn't really fill me with deep feelings like say...a meaningful story or seeing a sunrise.  Even for comics or webtoons, I'd choose a meaningful story with mediocre art over a bland story with amazing art quality.\n\n-11-\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n     They are all equally important because, altogether, they create the concept of time. One cannot exist without the other. I deal with the past by ruminating on it, the present by taking it day by day, and the future by applying optimistic nihilism.  \n\n-12-\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n     I fkkn say yes because I'm a people-pleasing pushover. If I decide to help them, it's because 1) I feel bad and want to avoid feeling guilty, 2) I want to feel like I'm competent in something, or 3) It's something they don't ask for often, so I'm willing to do it one or two times before I put my foot down, feeling guilty all the while. \n\n-13-\n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n     I don't necessarily need it, but yes, that would be nice. I can get discouraged and apathetic if things remains inconsistent. Because then people do what they want and leave others to clean up the mess. So, I'll still do what I need to do but the longer such unreliability goes on, the more burnt out I'll be. \n\n     HOWEVER.  I become discouraged and frustrated if things become too logical. For example, paperwork that takes up half of my shift. Even when I understand the reasoning for it, I resent having to do so much of it or I'll lose my job. So, rather than the act of it, the underlying reason for it leads me to feeling burnt out.  Qq", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I am definitely an emotional person, I can\u2019t say that I am not. I am that sort of a person that cries during movies or whenever somebody says something touching. I definitely feel my feeling ten times more than the average person. I love anything that can emotionally move me, any sort of art, music or literature. \n\nAt the same time I would not say I make decisions based on my emotions or that I am ruled by my heart. As contrasting as it sounds I am almost an obsessive researcher and I search for valid information and logical consistency in everything in my life. I hesitate to make any sort of a decision unless I feel like collected a valid number of unbiased objective data. I love to analyse this data and even discuss it in various intellectual arguments and disputes. I very much enjoy philosophical, intellectual debates where I can use all my knowledge and in such debates I can be very argumentative and I can put my emotions completely aside. \n\nI am interested in politics, philosophy, history or psychology and I can spend days researching these topics, remembering various data about it and using debates with other people as a tool of learning something new. But at the same time, I have to admit, all of my fields of interest are very human based. I like to learn about people, how they think, what motivates them throughout time and space and I am keen to learn to understand the human nature. \n\nI am a little too emotional when it comes to dealing with my own internal world. I am naturally introverted and very self analysing. I need to spend a lot of time alone to try and understand who I am, what drives me, what motivates, what makes me feel the way I feel. I have to admit that these introverted musings often lead me to rather melancholic states of mind. However, I don\u2019t see melancholy itself as anything bad, it often inspired me to think deeply about life, existence, the meaning of it all. These thoughts also often inspire me to be creative, to write poetry, lyrics, compose music or to come up with a fictional story. I often daydream and imagine myself in various scenarios. My biggest issue is that sometimes I get so lost in my musings and daydreams that I lose touch with the reality. I also often struggle with feeling excited about my work and my ideas at first but I lose interest pretty quickly, I tend to not finish what I start. \n\nAs a person who is very influenced by my internal ideas and internal ideals, I find it difficult to deal with the imperfection of reality and even myself. I am a perfectionist in a sense that I have an inner ideal of everything from the outside world to my own self and I try to get as close to this ideal as possible. This comes with quite a strict approach to certain things in my life from my diet, body, fashion and style to the books I read, tone of voice I use, information I try to learn and so on. I am hard on myself and I hate to feel like I am wasting my potential. I strive to become the most perfect the most ideal version of myself and that requires a lot of hard work that I am willing to do.\n\nSince there are many areas in my life I want to be perfect in, I tend to have many various hobbies and interests outside of work. I barely let myself just relax, there\u2019s always something I work on. I have various artistic, musical and literally projects that I work on as well as journalistic projects I work on every day.\n\nI love the adrenaline of a busy lifestyle and I need a bit of stress in my life to feel full-filled. Sitting at home, taking care of family would be a death of me. I love to have a busy to-do lists everyday, I am goal oriented and task driven. \n\nI am definitely not a natural leader and I like to think of myself as an independent worker but I often see that other people around me are much less driven and ambitious than I am. That is why I often find myself giving orders to others and naturally lead small teams, since usually I am the most ambitious one. ", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Used to be fairly well-versed in typology but it has been a while. Humor me?\n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am nineteen years old, male, and very tired. Physically, quite average, I think. Slightly scraggly, unkempt at times, but able to put in the effort to look decent when needed. I have a hard time describing myself, honestly. Been a little out of touch in that realm as of late. My apologies.\n\nIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nDPDR and MDD, the depersonalization being the most pressing issue at the moment. Working on it, though. Could be better, could be worse.\n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI was raised Mormon, eldest of ten children. I mentally left the church when I was fourteen, due to the logical fallacies and the dissociation that followed after my shelf broke. I was able to physically leave once I moved out at seventeen, though. Religion caused quite a bit of tension between my parents and I. I am by no means an aggressive or antagonistic person, just inquisitive, is all. Questioning is often not welcome in religious spheres, though. Doubt is like a poison, or a seed, if you will. I remember them saying something of the sort.\n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI have been working labor intensive odd jobs for the past year and a half. I plan on getting a much more consistent job soon, though. It depends on what I am tasked with, I suppose. Some are much more enjoyable than others. The pay varies as well. I do not like how inconsistent it is; the unnecessary confusion and stress takes a toll on my work ethic.\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nGood God, I could go for one of those. I would kill for a weekend to myself. I feel as if I am a better and more bearable person when I am alone. Sometimes I do miss the company of other human beings, but I realize that it is only in theory and not in practice. Some alone time is exactly what I need, though.\n\nWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI enjoy working with my hands, along with activities that have an end goal of sorts. Sports-wise I am actually fairly proficient when it comes to rollerblading. I also enjoy playing the odd basketball game and hiking. I take the most pleasure in cooking, fishing, gardening, and reading, though.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI like to think that I am fairly curious. I certainly do not shy away from anything that involves learning more about a particular subject. I have quite a few ideas that will appear in my head that I immediately shut down due to the inability to execute them. I suppose that I do not entertain too many impractical ideas and attempt to only acknowledge the realistic ones. I am curious about most things. I can usually think of quite a few questions for whatever subject I may be thinking about or observing presently. Usually my ideas tend to be biased towards my own personal areas of expertise or interest. I can often tie them back to a subject I am passionate about and go from there. I would say that my ideas have the potential to be both conceptual and environmental, it just happens to depend on the situation.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nMost likely, no. I do not want to be tasked with the responsibility of caring for others along with their needs, especially in a professional environment. I can barely follow, I certainly shouldn\u2019t be leading. If I absolutely had to for the sake of humanity or something of the sort, sure, maybe, but I would most likely take a delegative approach.\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI believe so? I am somewhat aware of my surroundings. I do enjoy working with my hands and I do appreciate the grounding aspect that comes with it. I cook quite often which allows me to blow off some steam. I also pin insect specimens which requires both patience and precision. I find that to be very enjoyable and relaxing. Additionally, I also keep tarantulas and the maintenance that comes alongside that comes with a decent amount of handiwork. Aside from those I also partake in building, fishing, gardening, manual labor, and woodworking.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forms of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nTo an extent. I am able to recognize what is visually pleasing to me and that also applies to others at times. I used to draw quite a bit in my youth but gradually lost interest the more my hobby was criticized. I am decent at realism, but I do not have much luck in the free-handing realm. I can appreciate lovely architecture, music, literature, painting and sculptures. No particular reason for those, simply just enjoyable to me.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI am the most out of touch with the present. When deep in thought I find myself either ruminating the past or contemplating the future. Sometimes I have to beg myself to participate in the present. It is similar to trudging through a swamp; not nearly as fluid or seemingly simple to me as wading through the past and future. To experience the present for a brief period of time I typically need to use substances.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI suppose it depends on the person and the task. I would be willing to help most people, I think, especially if it is a simple request. If someone is perfectly capable of doing it themselves and it is more-so a request out of pure laziness, I most likely would not assist them.\n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIt is preferred but that seems somewhat unattainable. I find myself relating to this quote from The Brothers Karamazov: \u201cI have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic.\u201d I do love logical consistency but is man a purely logical being? I wouldn\u2019t think so. I am somewhat grateful for that, though.\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nEfficiency is quite important to me. Saves me quite a bit of time and energy which is very helpful. Productivity is also fairly important, but less than efficiency, I think. I think the definition of productivity varies from person to person. One man may consider thinking to be productive while the other does not since it does not yield a physical product or response in the process. Is taking part in this questionnaire productive? It may be, if I receive answers, I suppose. It certainly depends.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI try not to. I do not like to meddle in the affairs of others. Sometimes I will offer my advice or input to those who are important to me, but I always add a disclaimer of sorts stating that I do not want to influence their decision. I have no reason to control others, that just seems rather strange. I am only in control of myself and my own actions, no need to add more to my plate.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nCooking, pinning insects, playing video games, reading, researching, and tarantula keeping are the main ones. I taught myself how to cook a year or so ago because I wanted to be more resourceful and self-sufficient. I also just happen to love good food. I began pinning insects to help further my experience and knowledge surrounding entomology since the subject is rather important to me. For video games I enjoy the Soulsborne genre more than anything. It is an enjoyable and somewhat relaxing way to blow off some steam. Reading and researching are in the same vein, I think. I mostly read the classics, philosophy, and science oriented texts. Research-wise my favorite subjects are entomology, marine biology, philosophy, and religion. Last but not least, tarantula keeping. I have been keeping tarantulas for four years. This has operated as a salvation of sorts, an out, if you will. I am not sure why it carries such a heavy importance to me. They are fascinating and wonderful creatures. It is difficult for me to elaborate much on the subject from a hobby stance but it is deeply personal to me.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI believe the learning style that benefits me the most is reading and writing. Kinesthetic and visual approaches are also helpful at times. I have an extremely difficult time with auditory based learning. I do not absorb much of anything in the process and often end up more confused than anything. Classes containing any of the approaches listed above sound lovely. I will not limit myself solely because I struggle in a certain area.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI believe I am adequate at strategizing. I used to take the improvisation route when I was a student since school was not very important to me. Now that I am older and somewhat wiser, I attempt to break down projects into smaller tasks when completing them. Creates a much more thorough and successful end product as well.\n\nWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI did want to become an entomologist but I do not have the time or the money to do so. Professionally I am just hoping for financial and mental stability. Nothing too out of the ordinary, I would just like to survive and be somewhat content. Personally, I would like to be a father. Settling down with a wife somewhere in the countryside sounds lovely. Maybe adopt a couple kids if that is something we felt we were capable of doing. Support my family, live a comfortable and modest life, tend to my hobbies, all that good stuff. Grow into a more humble and wiser person through the motions of life. Hopefully, y\u2019know.\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nIt is slightly difficult to put this answer into words but I will attempt. I fear incompetency and loss more than anything, I think. Being out of control of my responses is also humiliating. I am a fairly disciplined person so I attempt to keep to myself, especially in the emotional realm. It is difficult to explain why as well. It feels very deeply ingrained in me, it is almost as if I do not have an exact answer. Part of my character, I suppose.\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nAt my height I was entirely self-sufficient and able to maintain a consistent and steady routine. I was emotionally well, sober, and overall very content. It was nice. I had the time to appreciate the things around me. I was also much more grounded and present, I think. At peace with myself, I suppose.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nCurrently experiencing one of these, unfortunately. I turn to harmful habits to cope and have a tendency to shut others out. Become rather quiet and unapproachable in the process. I do not take very good care of myself and end up disregarding my safety. My well being gradually declines for quite some time until circumstances change.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nCertainly wouldn\u2019t say that I am extremely attached. I get lost in thought very, very often. I will pay attention to my surroundings when absolutely necessary, but even then, I struggle to do so.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nWould most likely begin by thinking about the absurdity of my situation along with the general surroundings and going from there. May have a few thoughts about my physical condition if I happened to be cold, hungry, tired, etc. I would most likely end up thinking about events that have occurred during my lifetime, regrets, philosophical ideas I have entertained, tarantulas, anything that frequently occupies my mind on a regular basis.\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt usually takes me quite a bit of time unless I have thought about it before. An entirely unexpected decision may take me anywhere from a day to a couple weeks to decide on. Decisions I have already taken into consideration usually only require an additional few hours for me to confirm. I do not find myself changing my mind often, especially if the decision has already been made.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI am not sure if I have ever fully processed my emotions. They should hold more importance to me, I think that would absolutely benefit me. I am so incredibly out of touch with them, though. I can never pinpoint how I am feeling outside of the physical sensation that follows. Because of this I have a difficult time connecting with others on an emotional level. I am not even sure where to begin to cope with it.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nDepends on the person. I feel as if it is rude to pretend to be interested when you are not, though. I remain indifferent in most cases, but I will listen to what someone has to say even if I do not agree with them. I would agree with someone if disagreeing would cause a greater issue, though. If agreeing with someone spares me some trouble I may occasionally take that route.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI do not break many rules but I do not abide by many rules, either. If there is an atrocious concept or rule presented to me, I may challenge it. I often will not outright challenge authority, though. I often do not care enough to do so. I would rather mind my own business, especially if it is not harming me personally.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who read this far.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I need some different perspectives on what you think my type is:\n\nthe first time I did the 16p test I got entj, even though I am pretty certain that's not my actual type as I was 17 and going through some sort of phase where I had a hyperfixation on wanting to study economics and figure out how the \"market\" works.

Not something I do on purpose I just forget whenever I promised to do something and I have to constantly remind myself of doing a certain task in order to actually execute it\n\n\\-I have been diagnosed with ADHD last year. I also did notice a few depressive tendencies and I feel very withdrawn whenever I lose inspiration or some sort of purpose\n\n\\-I am very interested in philosophy, psychology, mathematics and science, did study philosophy for a year and currently doing my bachelors degree in psychology and planning on doing my masters degree in forensic psychgoly\n\n\\-I want to help people and fairness is very important to me, however I am not the best at giving emotional support as I prefer a more rational approach\n\n\\-I am extremely good at problem solving; finding out the cause of a problem and logically deducting how it can be fixed, i am also extremely idealistic and sometimes think of solutions that are not directly tied to a conventional, realistic approach\n\n\\-Interestingly I am very bad with showing or understanding emotions, I feel very confused when people around me expect me to \"get\" how they are feeling, I simply can't do it, I need people people to tell me how they feel in order to understand it fully, it can also be applied for myself; I tend to rationalize my feelings, most of the time I feel like I don't even have access to them, the only time I can ever actually \"feel\" them is when I can create some kind of outlet, which takes a lot of focus and doesn't come naturally to me.\n\n\\-i have huge trust issues, my last relationship was over two years ago and extremely unfulfilling which is probably due to my inability to open up completely, I am working on it tho\n\n\\-I wanted to be an actress when I was younger, as I always had a fascination for taking on a different persona or role \n\n\\-I have always been extremely curious about the world, always asking why things are the way they are, why systems work the way they do, always wanting to find correlations between systems and patterns, I am very curious about people too, but even in that department I would say a more rational approach comes easier to me.\n\n\\-I am very creative and have a vivid imagination, I have a degree in graphic design and video editing, which I always enjoyed very much, I also always come up with some sort of scenario or even full on music video when I am listening to music\n\n\\-I love the outdoors, I love to travel and learn about different cultures, ways of living, expading my viewpoint of the world and tap into something completely unknown\n\n\\-I see my life as a sequence of specific concepts of things, rarely seeing the things for what they \"are\"\n\n\\-I have sudden realizations about how I felt in a situation that is months, sometimes years ago, I am completely unaware of it as it happens, leading to me putting myself in very uncomfortable situations but failing to realize how I feel due to complete unawareness of my own emotional state (Fi blindspot?)\n\n\\-I have been told I come off as emotionless, mischievous and like I \"don't give a fuck about anything\" (which is not necessarily true but I do understand why people could assume something like that)\n\n\\-I was shy when I was a child, but that quickly improved when I learned to trust my own perspective on things, kind of the opposite now\n\n\\-I grew up in a very guarded household, my mom kind of projected her own insecurities onto me due to her necessities never being fully fulfilled as a kid which led to her being very anxious and always wanting to give me everything she could, this led to me having no understanding of boundaries and also a feeling of having to grow up very fast as my mom would always panic when I came to her with a problem, I used to be very angry at her because of this but I am learning to meet her with a lot more empathy and understanding\n\n\\-I always struggled with authorities, especially in school, critizised their way of teaching, always wanting to do things my own way, skipped class a lot, was a very \"wild\" and argumentative kid you could say, couldn't resist a possibility to feel some kind of thrill\n\n\\-I am a walking contradiction, having a god complex and inferiority complex at the same time\n\n\\-I do have a lot of anger issues, which I did leave out on people even though it wasn't their fault, this could be due to repressed emotion (could also just be trauma or my mental health in general, idk if this has to correlate with mbti at all)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that I vented all my confusion and emotional turmoil onto you, please feel free to (try to) type me :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": " ENTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Just me doubting my type again because I can\u2019t see the Ti in me that\u2019s supposed to come with Si-Fe lmao\n\nI know I can feel the emotion of a person at a given time through details such as tone, body language, etc. as long as they\u2019re not expressionless at the time. It\u2019s mostly picking up the little details of what\u2019s different from their usual self. And I feel their emotion, but also in a more detached way. I\u2019d say more sympathy than empathy. \n\nLike I could pick up that they\u2019re feeling down and feel compelled to cheer them up, frustrated if my attempts are dismissed. I won\u2019t force them to be happy when they\u2019re clearly going through something, but I feel troubled for them. \n\nI can also somewhat sense the atmosphere given that it is a familiar setting. Again, just picking up what feels off through cues like someone\u2019s tone. \n\nWith all this, I don\u2019t really feel it deeply. I\u2019m not moved, or at least not as much. It\u2019s something that feels like clothes, like something that I can just brush off. \n\nI rarely feel strongly for something, cause or anything, except for in my relationships. I\u2019m not the \u201cif you don\u2019t do as I say then you don\u2019t love me\u201d kind, but I\u2019m still controlling in the sense that if I feel like I\u2019m not getting my share of emotional feedback I could just blow up on the spot. I can be feeling like something\u2019s right or wrong in the moment, but I can\u2019t make it a measurable standard. I can\u2019t say what\u2019s right. This seems like the right thing, but also, what do I know? I can only express it, but I don\u2019t have spelt out standards for right vs. wrong. I just know that if something\u2019s disagreed with by the majority, then it is refrained from. Could go both ways, good or bad. \n\nBeing \u201cright\u201d would be for the greater good of most people, right? And we should also listen to the actual voices of those who are not in the most, removed from biases. Yet it\u2019s impossible to be completely free from bias, so the best of Human capabilities would be to just try to find the truth of needs among many voices.

{"submission": "I get incredibly passionate about both.\n\nI ranted to my dad for about an hour the other day trying to explain E=mc\u00b2, inflationary theory and general relativity - because I was wondering \u201cwhy don\u2019t we fall into the sun while orbiting it?\u201d\n\nThe answer was: earth will remain at a constant speed; the sun isn\u2019t \u201csucking the earth in\u201d, it\u2019s general relativity, the sun is a supermassive object bending space time; and earth is just trying to travel forward in motion and nothing is stopping it - because space is inertial - in the path of least resistance, but because the sun is bending spacetime, that path of least resistance is the spacetime around the sun, which is curved. Nothing is slowing earth down so it won\u2019t fall into the sun.\n\nAnyway, see?

{"submission": "So basically, I am confused. I often type as ENFP and INTP and INFP in online tests but I don't exactly match any of the descriptions too well, to my understanding. So, here goes...\n\nI am 24 years old. I'm a male. Since I was small, I've had anxiety issues and currently have ocd, ptsd and gad.\n\nI come from a religious background but sometimes have my doubts. It's when I have these doubts that I actually find myself more grounded in worldly matters.\nI was fairly good at sports, but definitely not above average in any regard. It takes me quite some time to learn a repeated motion like a simple keep-up technique in football. Besides that, I've always been good with my hands. I can sketch and draw pretty darn well. I like having a general idea but I dislike being forced into a \"mould\" when working on something creative.\nAs a kid I've had a lot of forgetful episodes where I wouldn't do my homework and sometimes even forget my jacket, bag or shoes somewhere in school. I used to be a bit more social before, although over the years I've become more of a bedroom cav-dweller. I only have a dozen friends thati call close, and I only ever hang with5-6 of them. I do very well in mathematics and computer science. As a matter of fact, I taught myself computer science in my final year at high school (scored perfect). However, I often get overwhelmed by things I perceive as too hard. I do like stricture because it gives my a stencil to trace on instead of having me sit down and look for a solution for hours.\nI'm seemingly hardworking in school and uni and for personal projects but not at home... for most of my school years, I was driven by competition. Wanted to beat my rival (he's only my rival in my head).\n\nI used to be known as somewhat of a slob (Spiderman reference). I never really cared much for physical appearances or dating or even physical hygiene at times. As a 12 year old I would actually go days without showering sometimes. Obviously this all changed after a while. Though I still neglected my hairstyle, cutting my nails consistently etc... pls don't be grossed out, I was a kid. \n\nI've been described as somebody who is intelligent, possesses immense general knowledge, pensive, \"the smartest and dumbest person i know\", \"a goof\", \"indecisive\", quick thinking, attentive and naturally gifted. Im also known to be quite honest and lack filter. Shamefully, I even tell my mom whenever I spot a lie in her words, or if the food ain't good today (sorry mom, ily). I have some anger issues due to how life gets. People always do label .e as sharp or intelligent, even though I do think of myself as rather dumb.\n\nOver the years I've gotten more accustomed to working out, meditating and searching for good hobbies. I used to quit and go back to playing a few toxic games for years btw. Kind of weird.im not the best at reading people, though I can tell right from wrong well enough.\nI generally feel introverted but I don't have any trouble making conversation with anyone (except girls, though im improving).\n\nI like memes and good music, but not too many memes. After a while it just feels weird to see opium birds 24/7. \n\nI tried a computing course before, but due to mental issues and the terrible quality of the institution I attended, I dropped it to pursue something else.\n\nI'm currently doing economics elsewhere.\n\nMy hobbies include: collecting earphones, exercising, walking, eating good stuff, reminiscing, listening to music, watching anime and shows and all that (but not anything mainstream), watching football, thinking up stuff, overthinking, doing the bare minimum for school, being goofy\n\nI dislike: noisy people, fake people, entitled people, liars, mosquitoes, people that don't think for themselves, social norms that people mindlessly obey, crappy fashion, people that think they're better than everyone else, untidiness, pointless waste, unfinished stories and facts, reading, trends (fortnite 2018 ew), mean people, being told to do things (I'm too busy doing nothing), pretentiousness \n\nI like: people that understand, cuddling, noodles, toys, walking, being left alone, having what I learn translate into real life results, good nostalgic feelings, sunset viewed from a window at an angle, dragon ball z and other badass anime, my own dumb fantasies \n\nThanks for reading, if you made it this far!", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": " \n\nQ. How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nA. I\u2019m 17, male. Hmmm\u2026 I\u2019d say I\u2019m relatively self aware, but it\u2019s something I always assumed everyone had if I\u2019m honest. I\u2019m aware of my position in life, but I\u2019ve just come to accept it and observe it in a way, I thought everyone was like this, aware and cohesive, having a formed worldview\u2026 but just not bothered to do anything about it physically. I feel like a lot of my life revolves around ideas and thoughts, cyclical patterns that I pick up, I mean, I\u2019m so lazy\u2026 like, I don\u2019t often read or watch videos to learn new information, but when I do? I become that much more confident, every step feels better when I walk outside, everything I observe perviates into my mind as this amalgamation of other things that bare similar attributes to it\u2026 that\u2019s the best way I can describe it, lmao\u2026 sounds pretentious af, I know; like those philosophers that explain everything in the most complex and sophisticated way possible to describe their ideas, but yknow, maybe they\u2019re onto something? Maybe it is the most freeing way to describe things? Or maybe it\u2019s just an aesthetic appeal\u2026 idk.\n\nQ. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nA. I\u2019m really not sure I have much to say in this department. It was very normal, aside from my parents rather rocky divorce when I was around 10-11; I\u2019m sure it had an effect on me, and if I went to see a psychologist I\u2019m sure they\u2019d say it has inflicted deep wounds or whatever\u2026 but, I think more or less I\u2019ve gotten over it after realising how little it truly matters to me that they love each other.\n\nQ. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nA. I\u2019m in college, studying sociology, English literature and Film. It\u2019s fine\u2026 I wanted to do physics, but I only found my \u201clove\u201d - I\u2019m not even sure if I do love it, at least not for what it is\u2026 if I loved it surely I\u2019d be digging into it constantly? But knowledge scares me, because it reminds me of my lack of it. Then again, physics is especially the subject that gives me that sense of \u201cwholeness\u201d that I described earlier. But yeah, I couldn\u2019t do physics since I didn\u2019t get a high enough grade. Just because I didn\u2019t really try on my exams\u2026 I didn\u2019t like physics back then: Newtonian mechanics, that kind of stuff is very boring to me. I did pass though\u2026 I passed all my subjects, god knows how\u2026\n\nQ. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nA. Idk if I\u2019d feel refreshed\u2026 this one is difficult to answer if I\u2019m honest. I find that when I\u2019m alone, I don\u2019t expend any energy but unless I\u2019m doing something I love - which is basically only physics haha, it scares me, the prospect of learning it and not being able to comprehend some of the material, so I just avoid it\u2026 but I really do like it when I get it\u2026 sometimes I just get it intuitively though? Like, if you asked me to step-by-step explain special relativity, I doubt I could without gathering my thoughts for awhile, but I understand the beauty of it so perfectly.\n\nQ. What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\nA. Idk\u2026 I\u2019m not too bothered about the physical world, although that\u2019s kind of a lie, I can binge sometimes on food\u2026 and I love eating the same chocolate bar over and over while I do something, but I also have this disdain almost for those that are fixated on it - my mom for example, although I love her to death, she\u2019s far too focused on the physical world to not annoy me a little bit.\n\nQ. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nA. I\u2019m not sure\u2026 kind of curious? I can become so fixated though sometimes. I\u2019m not curious with things that don\u2019t interest me: like I was playing Elden Ring, and in that game I took such little time to explore; I\u2019ve found this is a pattern with story games where I\u2019m given my mission and I kind of just want to reach it\u2026 but then I\u2019ll replay the game over and over again to try out different builds and play styles\u2026 but I just LOVE seeing my character develop from having \u201cmeh\u201d gear to almighty and powerful gear. Those are my favourite kinds of games, I just love that development\u2026\n\nQ. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nA. No, haha\u2026 I\u2019d be pretty bad at it, but again it all depends I suppose. I doubt I\u2019d be very good at it, probably lead everyone to their deaths, lmao.\n\nQ. Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nA. Probably not? It\u2019s hard to say\u2026 I have moments of coordination, like I went out with my friends, kicked a ball about and if I\u2019m really in the mood, I can enjoy it\u2026 most of the time I\u2019m too lethargic and distracted to pay attention to anything that\u2019s going on though.\n\nQ. Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nA. Yeah, yeah I am. Art is a very strange thing to me, because part of me hates it and part of me loves it. It\u2019s this constant expression of the same thing that every human feels, yet also every human feels the needs to spill their guts when many before them - with the exact same feelings - have spilled their guts in just the same way. Art reminds me of the complete and utter repetition of this world; how nothing ever truly advances. It\u2019s like school, it\u2019s like weddings, it\u2019s like childbirth\u2026 it\u2019s all just over and over and over and over, constantly turning. And I mean, art expresses this perfectly\u2026 and there\u2019s beauty behind it, behind accepting one\u2019s position as a speck, a cog, a futile marriage that alters no one\u2019s life but yours\u2026 there is a certain beauty about that, but fuck it\u2019s depressing seeing someone scream about how much they love someone, and knowing how pointless their love is. I have a certain anger towards the world in that sense; I\u2019m just thrust into this chasm where no one can ever mean anything. But I think art portrays that anger perfectly. I\u2019ve always said that I love the idea of reaming at something, and then projecting that passion into acceptance\u2026 from one force of will, with the exact same passion exalting all of that force into the cause that you were fighting for, after realising it\u2019s futility. Okay this was a long one\u2026 damn\u2026 I\u2019m so long-winded, I think I\u2019ll just answer the most important ones from now on - or at least just give shorter answers.\n\nQ. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know how much I think about either if I\u2019m honest, I think about the future more than the past though, I\u2019d say. But I\u2019m definitely not neglectful of the past, you can learn a lot from it.\n\nQ. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nA. I\u2019d be inclined to help them sometimes\u2026 but like\u2026 for example: when I was in Highschool, my friends would knock on for me sometimes, asking me to come out. And oftentimes I would, but I\u2019d say no, just out of some kind of spite I suppose? I\u2019d want to go out, but I\u2019d say no, to become some kind of disruptive force I suppose?\n\nQ. Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nA. Sure.\n\nQ. How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nA. Kind of important, but it comes in so many forms\u2026 I don\u2019t think my perception of productivity is the same as some business man, for example.\n\nQ. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nA. Guitar and writing mostly; I like them because they allow me to be creative and express certain paradoxes and observations I\u2019ve made - although, I rarely ever write, because I\u2019m always learning something new, so when I start writing, I\u2019ll learn something new since I started and it\u2019ll make me want to start again, so it\u2019s impossible to finish anything.\n\nQ. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nA. Reading\u2026 although I can honestly have a lot of trouble following trains of thought that aren\u2019t my own; maybe others are just shit at explaining things, or maybe I\u2019m just a shit listener.\n\nQ. What's important to you and why?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m honest\u2026 :/\n\nQ. What are your aspirations?\n\nA. Not sure\u2026 to be a writer? Even then, I\u2019m not really sure how much I care about being successful\u2026\n\nQ. What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nA. Many things\u2026 ummmm, pfftttt, being useless? Being insignificant. Those are probably my most prominent fears - it\u2019s kind of why I can distance myself from the world at times, and act like it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nQ. What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nA. VERY high.\n\nQ. What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nA. VERY low.\n\nQ. Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nA. All sorts of things, but they\u2019ll most likely be related to the darkness of the room, idk I\u2019ll probably try find some symbolic meaning or something in it\u2026\n\nOkay!!! That\u2019s it, ima leave the rest\u2026 thanks for reading all that if you did, I know it\u2019s a lot\u2026 \n\nQ. How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nA. I\u2019m 17, male. Hmmm\u2026 I\u2019d say I\u2019m relatively self aware, but it\u2019s something I always assumed everyone had if I\u2019m honest. I\u2019m aware of my position in life, but I\u2019ve just come to accept it and observe it in a way, I thought everyone was like this, aware and cohesive, having a formed worldview\u2026 but just not bothered to do anything about it physically. I feel like a lot of my life revolves around ideas and thoughts, cyclical patterns that I pick up, I mean, I\u2019m so lazy\u2026 like, I don\u2019t often read or watch videos to learn new information, but when I do? I become that much more confident, every step feels better when I walk outside, everything I observe perviates into my mind as this amalgamation of other things that bare similar attributes to it\u2026 that\u2019s the best way I can describe it, lmao\u2026 sounds pretentious af, I know; like those philosophers that explain everything in the most complex and sophisticated way possible to describe their ideas, but yknow, maybe they\u2019re onto something? Maybe it is the most freeing way to describe things? Or maybe it\u2019s just an aesthetic appeal\u2026 idk.\n\nQ. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nA. I\u2019m really not sure I have much to say in this department. It was very normal, aside from my parents rather rocky divorce when I was around 10-11; I\u2019m sure it had an effect on me, and if I went to see a psychologist I\u2019m sure they\u2019d say it has inflicted deep wounds or whatever\u2026 but, I think more or less I\u2019ve gotten over it after realising how little it truly matters to me that they love each other.\n\nQ. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nA. I\u2019m in college, studying sociology, English literature and Film. It\u2019s fine\u2026 I wanted to do physics, but I only found my \u201clove\u201d - I\u2019m not even sure if I do love it, at least not for what it is\u2026 if I loved it surely I\u2019d be digging into it constantly? But knowledge scares me, because it reminds me of my lack of it. Then again, physics is especially the subject that gives me that sense of \u201cwholeness\u201d that I described earlier. But yeah, I couldn\u2019t do physics since I didn\u2019t get a high enough grade. Just because I didn\u2019t really try on my exams\u2026 I didn\u2019t like physics back then: Newtonian mechanics, that kind of stuff is very boring to me. I did pass though\u2026 I passed all my subjects, god knows how\u2026\n\nQ. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nA. Idk if I\u2019d feel refreshed\u2026 this one is difficult to answer if I\u2019m honest. I find that when I\u2019m alone, I don\u2019t expend any energy but unless I\u2019m doing something I love - which is basically only physics haha, it scares me, the prospect of learning it and not being able to comprehend some of the material, so I just avoid it\u2026 but I really do like it when I get it\u2026 sometimes I just get it intuitively though? Like, if you asked me to step-by-step explain special relativity, I doubt I could without gathering my thoughts for awhile, but I understand the beauty of it so perfectly.\n\nQ. What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\nA. Idk\u2026 I\u2019m not too bothered about the physical world, although that\u2019s kind of a lie, I can binge sometimes on food\u2026 and I love eating the same chocolate bar over and over while I do something, but I also have this disdain almost for those that are fixated on it - my mom for example, although I love her to death, she\u2019s far too focused on the physical world to not annoy me a little bit.\n\nQ. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nA. I\u2019m not sure\u2026 kind of curious? I can become so fixated though sometimes. I\u2019m not curious with things that don\u2019t interest me: like I was playing Elden Ring, and in that game I took such little time to explore; I\u2019ve found this is a pattern with story games where I\u2019m given my mission and I kind of just want to reach it\u2026 but then I\u2019ll replay the game over and over again to try out different builds and play styles\u2026 but I just LOVE seeing my character develop from having \u201cmeh\u201d gear to almighty and powerful gear. Those are my favourite kinds of games, I just love that development\u2026\n\nQ. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nA. No, haha\u2026 I\u2019d be pretty bad at it, but again it all depends I suppose. I doubt I\u2019d be very good at it, probably lead everyone to their deaths, lmao.\n\nQ. Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nA. Probably not? It\u2019s hard to say\u2026 I have moments of coordination, like I went out with my friends, kicked a ball about and if I\u2019m really in the mood, I can enjoy it\u2026 most of the time I\u2019m too lethargic and distracted to pay attention to anything that\u2019s going on though.\n\nQ. Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nA. Yeah, yeah I am. Art is a very strange thing to me, because part of me hates it and part of me loves it. It\u2019s this constant expression of the same thing that every human feels, yet also every human feels the needs to spill their guts when many before them - with the exact same feelings - have spilled their guts in just the same way. Art reminds me of the complete and utter repetition of this world; how nothing ever truly advances. It\u2019s like school, it\u2019s like weddings, it\u2019s like childbirth\u2026 it\u2019s all just over and over and over and over, constantly turning. And I mean, art expresses this perfectly\u2026 and there\u2019s beauty behind it, behind accepting one\u2019s position as a speck, a cog, a futile marriage that alters no one\u2019s life but yours\u2026 there is a certain beauty about that, but fuck it\u2019s depressing seeing someone scream about how much they love someone, and knowing how pointless their love is. I have a certain anger towards the world in that sense; I\u2019m just thrust into this chasm where no one can ever mean anything. But I think art portrays that anger perfectly. I\u2019ve always said that I love the idea of reaming at something, and then projecting that passion into acceptance\u2026 from one force of will, with the exact same passion exalting all of that force into the cause that you were fighting for, after realising it\u2019s futility. Okay this was a long one\u2026 damn\u2026 I\u2019m so long-winded, I think I\u2019ll just answer the most important ones from now on - or at least just give shorter answers.\n\nQ. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know how much I think about either if I\u2019m honest, I think about the future more than the past though, I\u2019d say. But I\u2019m definitely not neglectful of the past, you can learn a lot from it.\n\nQ. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nA. I\u2019d be inclined to help them sometimes\u2026 but like\u2026 for example: when I was in Highschool, my friends would knock on for me sometimes, asking me to come out. And oftentimes I would, but I\u2019d say no, just out of some kind of spite I suppose? I\u2019d want to go out, but I\u2019d say no, to become some kind of disruptive force I suppose?\n\nQ. Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nA. Sure.\n\nQ. How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nA. Kind of important, but it comes in so many forms\u2026 I don\u2019t think my perception of productivity is the same as some business man, for example.\n\nQ. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nA. Guitar and writing mostly; I like them because they allow me to be creative and express certain paradoxes and observations I\u2019ve made - although, I rarely ever write, because I\u2019m always learning something new, so when I start writing, I\u2019ll learn something new since I started and it\u2019ll make me want to start again, so it\u2019s impossible to finish anything.\n\nQ. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nA. Reading\u2026 although I can honestly have a lot of trouble following trains of thought that aren\u2019t my own; maybe others are just shit at explaining things, or maybe I\u2019m just a shit listener.\n\nQ. What's important to you and why?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m honest\u2026 :/\n\nQ. What are your aspirations?\n\nA. Not sure\u2026 to be a writer? Even then, I\u2019m not really sure how much I care about being successful\u2026\n\nQ. What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nA. Many things\u2026 ummmm, pfftttt, being useless? Being insignificant. Those are probably my most prominent fears - it\u2019s kind of why I can distance myself from the world at times, and act like it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nQ. What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nA. VERY high.\n\nQ. What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nA. VERY low.\n\nQ. Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nA. All sorts of things, but they\u2019ll most likely be related to the darkness of the room, idk I\u2019ll probably try find some symbolic meaning or something in it\u2026\n\nOkay!!!

Like if it doesn't traumatize someone, go right ahead\n\n\u2022 Lately I've been super interested in detective themed things and naturally love things that involve being deductive, analytical, and so on and even like to start \"investigations\" for fun (idk how to explain it) even though I usually turn out wrong (but if this means Ti, then it would be just beginning to develop which is why I'm usually wrong)\n\n\u2022 I can't bring myself to lie and it's almost like I'm physically incapable but I don't feel like it's because I find it morally bad, it's just that it feels like a waste of time\n\n\u2022 I think there are a few examples of me using Fi in the way that they have values like, I value persistence, authenticity, cleverness etcetc\n\n\u2022 Whenever someone does something petty to show that they're \"superior\" I'm more focused on \"well whats the point/logic of that?\" Instead of \"wow, I'd never do that, that's bad\"\n\n\u2022 When trying to \"solve\" something I usually take it apart and try to do it myself and I'll take a LONGG time and open up 6 million different sources before I come to a conclusion but I'll also ask other people about it and I might even get so indecisive to where I come to a point where I ask people to review it all and just come to the conclusion for me (like what I'm doing right now) \n\n\u2022 It's difficult for me to see things as black and white because I can always come up with a way to justify practically anything in my head and can easily see the gray area, always (is this just Ne or is it a sign that I don't have a lot of Fi?)\n\n\u2022 I actually went a long time thinking that I have no morals other than \"don't be a jerk\" but I do have a few, based off of things that I was personally upset by, for example I don't like people being nosy towards me so one of my morals/values is \"don't be nosy\" and I'll get very disappointed in myself fast if I don't follow it, this is just 1 example \n\n\u2022 When I was a little younger I trolled people online as one of my main hobbies and I was just a little jerk thus contradicting my previous statement of \"don't be a jerk\" but that's fine (I feel like this is tertiary Fe)\n\n\u2022 In every test I take (I know tests are untrustworthy but this is other than 16personalities) whether it be Michael caloz, johnstest, mistype investigator, etc I always get ENTP but they also suggest enfp or intp in 2nd and 3rd place\n\n\u2022 I feel like I'm ALWAYS analyzing something and trying to solve it but the whole purpose of my analysis is to come to a conclusion of some sort or make sure I'm right about it so I'm not sure if this points to Ti or Te\n\n\u2022 I'm either VERY good or absolutely awful at reading people, no in-between.

{"submission": "**Reasons for high Ti (or preference over Te)**\n\n* I like to rationalize everything and will believe in things that make sense to me.\n* Whenever I'm listening to a debate, I can quickly spot logical inconsistencies in arguments and think about possible counterarguments.\n* I don't really care about efficiency and productivity. I don't really like leading projects and will allow anyone to take the lead if they want to.\n* I'm not someone who is overly concerned with factual data and statistics when researching something. Even though they can be important, the reasoning behind them matters more. If they don't make sense, I won't consider them.\n* Facts are important but the reasoning between them matter more: do they make sense or is there something that seems off?\n* I like to question my position and beliefs because it\u2019s important to be open minded and to take in knowledge and information that could change my mind.\n\n**Reasons for high Ne**\n\n* I have a wide arrange of interests and I can be quick to abandon them if they don't amuse me anymore.\n* My speech pattern usually jumps from subject to subject.

I've never voiced my opinions and feelings and cried often as a child, as I grew up, I realized I was/am trans and met oppression from my family, that was the last straw for me as I isolated myself from nearly all human contact for years, staying in my room conducting reasearchs and studying, quite literally, everything, meanwhile I turned truly apathetic (I was around 12 or 13 by then). At 17 I began to take more control over my own life, I've made friends online and started to listen more to their feelings, later I began to stop ignoring my feelings, still I wasn't able to determine what feeling was what precisely (of course I could with the more simple ones, but I couldn't tell pride and happiness apart). Nowadays, I'm still as much of a shut in as always, and I still have some trouble dealing with feelings, but I am learning.\n\nAs far as religion goes, I've studied multiple and my whole family have been a mixture of Catholicism, African based religions and witchcraft, I personally believe and practice the later one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnemployed, but I study, and love it as much as I don't plan to ever stop doing so. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel?

Do you like, and are you good at sports?

How do you deal with them?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's weird, I hate the idea of growing old because I still feel like I have much to learn in very little time, yet I keep on procrastinating and acting as if I had Infinite time. I have a extremely good memory but don't seem to hold my past in them, I forgot some of it and rather evade the rest.\n\nI also have little to no time awareness, and quite often use too much or too little time on stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepends on who, what and why. If it is someone I hate, I won't help regardless. Someone I like, I just wouldn't help if it would bring something negative to them. In a neutral scenario if the person truly needs help I'll do because I most likely would be able to show off some of the knowledge I accumulated in these years, if not, I'd request some sort of payment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Do you need logical consistency in your life?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLogical inconsistency more likely, I try to be logical, but fail some times, my logic is based often in deductions and subjective interpretation of knowledge. I don't require others around me to be logical tho\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How important are efficiency and productivity to you?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant in a grand scale of somethings, but I don't care about it in my personal life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNope, I'm quite naive so the opposite happens, I often get used by people I distrust because I saw no harm in trying to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always been able to learn stuff easily, no matter the style of teaching. I do prefer theory over parctice in learning tho\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you tend to wing projects and improvise as you go?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm probably average at it honestly, I hate not having a plan, but just a general one is fine. I do tend to plan more (and often more than I should) in stuff that require social skills, I prefer to just improvise on those, or I'll procrastinate months getting ready\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll keep studying and participating in colleges throughout all my life span, probably work on whathever I can/feel like or whatever pays more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate?\\* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime and interactions, as said before. Also to loose the people I care about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHard to say, moments my researchs made some developments, compliments I recieved and moments I could use intelligence and/or creativity for problem solving. Also the moments I met my friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe time I came out to my family and the multiple assalts they commited against me. Also high school, it was mostly online but I had to go for a few weeks, I suffered some forms of sexual assalts and retaliated with agression, not stuff I'm proud of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI daydream a ton, probably more than the average person\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about it?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would talk to myself and simulate conversations with people I've met, also probably link stuff I've learned along the years (as example how the medieval churchs are connected to nowadays social stigmas and etc). Once I got bored I'd probably try to find a way out\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make a decision is quick for me, I take time to execute it. I cam change if I learn or deduce something new\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I do process them it's instantly, other than that I could try for years and be unable to understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm overcoming this, I'm still unable to be honest if the truth impact directly the person. Other than that I'm quite blunt (when stating facts or making fun of something)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't often break rules as I barely have any imposed to me, I do question them often and encourge people to break them. Someone wise should be allowed to give advices without suffering oppression, someone wiser will do it rightfully despite the oppression, authority should be questioned for the evolution of it.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Here are my answers to the questions. I LOVE myself a long questionnaire lol. Very, very curious what you all think! \nAlso, I added 3 pictures: one where I\u2019m just presenting myself professionaly, one in my natural habitat (in this case at the entrance of a museum lol) and one one an off day (with my beloved stuffed tree Emrik). \n\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n31, F\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\nADHD, C-PTSD\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\nI was raised by a single mother. Very atheist, anything that wasn\u2019t scientifically back was frowned upon, but simultaneously, my mother lacked knowledge and is overall very naive. Lack of emotional warmth, but my mother is a very expressive person nonetheless - it\u2019s just that she mostly expresses her thoughts in a dramatic way. I ran away from home when I was 3 yrs old, because I felt like my mom was restricting my innate sense of adventure that I was dying to explore. I truly felt as if I was old enough to be responsible. \nMy overall experience of my childhood was one of feeling unsafe and deeply misunderstood.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\nI am being trained to become a professional peer advocate, meaning I am being taught how to work in a recovery-oriented manner. My personal dream and aspiration, is to have a multidisciplinary approach. I firmly believe that healing can be found in community (connecting with other, sharing vulnerability) and creation (both through creative endeavors as well as by recreating, rewriting ones own narrative about the self). I also feel a strong need to be capable of working in different environments and with different people, different projects. Creativity and community are also mandatory for me if I want to be able to function myself. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\nI am great at spending my time alone. There\u2019s always something creative that I can do, or I\u2019d just go outside and absorb the environment, feel refreshed and inspired by it. I have a very vivid inner world, where I am always interacting with my daydream characters, so I don\u2019t ever feel alone when I\u2019m alone anyway. My daydream characters are typically just people from my real life, but also celebrities, the author of a book I\u2019m currently reading, stuff like that. \nHalf of the time, when I\u2019m alone, I just have solo dance and karaoke parties though. With said daydream characters being present in my mind (and with that my experience of reality, even though I know it\u2019s fake) as well. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\nI like activities that stimulate my mind and feed my creative energy. That includes most cultural things, like going to the theater, the museum (those are my favs). I also love thrifting. And birdwatching! \nI love both indoor and outdoor activities - what matters more to me, is how stimulating the activity is. \nI am not very good at sports, mostly due to my shitty hand-eye coordination and my fear of fast moving objects (like balls) lol. And sports don\u2019t stimulate my mental realm, so even though it makes me feel more relaxed afterwards, I\u2019m not naturally drawn to it for that reason. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\nI am very curious and have 1000 more ideas than I can execute, or even put into words. \nMost of my curiosities relate to the human experience somehow, but also to creating things that don\u2019t exist (this mostly applies to my visual art - I despise not being original!). \nI love getting to the core of the human experience and feel like I\u2019m actually getting there. I am constantly finding new puzzle pieces that fit into what I intuitively already felt to be the truth. Nothing excites me more that learning that someone with a great status has written about something in their book for example, and that I already came to that conclusion by myself beforehand! And this happens very, very often. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\nPeople often think of me as a leader-type, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable in that position. Simultaneously, I do tend to take it on, mostly because I love to form new groups. I am usually the one who initiates e.g. e group chat, a group activity, stuff like that. \nI usually end up distancing myself from the formed group and can thoroughly enjoy the fact that I know I made people connect to each other whilst feeling comfortable moving onto the next thing in my own life. \n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\nHmm, not so sure if I am. I am very messy with my approach to things, often going from one thing to the completely opposite thing, to something else and back to where I started. Could be the ADHD though, hard to say. \nI love working with my hands when it comes to creativity, like painting for example. I love exploring what different materials can do and how I can interact with them in innovative ways. \n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\nI am very artistic, but it doesn\u2019t always come easy. I am so inclined on being unique with what I do that I sometimes nearly feel immobilized prior to starting a project, simply out of the fear of my work not being authentic. \nBut, once I get started, I cannot be stopped. I love seeing how things unfold. I suck at trying to plan what I\u2019m going to create beforehand - that\u2019s also what causes me to freeze. It feels very unnatural to approach my creative processes like that. \nMy art is typically \u2018dark\u2019 (according to others), but to me, they\u2019re just about my life. I love to capture the most painful moments in a very direct manner. \n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\nI like to think of myself as a time traveller - I can easily go back into my consciousness from the past and feel like I exist in that time again. For me, the entire experience of the self is always just that - an experience - and therefore, the time in which it finds place is not as relevant. I can feel as if I\u2019m living in the past, present and future in one day, simply because that\u2019s where I choose to let my consciousness go. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\nI easily feel offended when offered help, as if the other person is underestimating my abilities to do it myself, or as if they feel I\u2019m not efficient enough. \nI also rarely think about helping others, I naturally try and see how we can be most efficient by doing things alone together instead. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\nMeh, not really. I don\u2019t like consistency anyway. \nI am not very logical myself, so I find in comfortable when life mirrors that back to me. It makes me feel more connected to the world around me. \n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\nVery important, but also something I\u2019m not always good at. I recognize the importance and can even feel very frustrated when I think of other people as inefficient. \nAs for being productive, I feel constantly torn between wanting to be productive and wanting to just chill and experience life as is without any expectations. It\u2019s a true 50/50 situation for me, this one. Or at least that\u2019s what it feels like. \n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\nI tend to give (unsolicited) advice and can feel offended when people are doubting my truth in regards of their situation. I have often already put so much work into trying to understand something (albeit mostly through just \u2018feeling\u2019 that it\u2019s right rather that basing it off of facts), that when people reject my advice I can sometimes feel rejected as a whole. \nI rationally understand that this is fucked up lol. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\nAnything creative, anything adventurous, anything new and inspiring. \nCreative and mental stimulation are mandatory and I feel they can be found in so many things. I cannot make a definitive selection. I love to find new hobbies and interests. \nBut as for today, I enjoy painting, drawing, learning to play the guitar/ukulele, dancing, thrift shopping, reading (mostly non-fiction), listening to podcasts, going to the theater, the museum or spend time in nature. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\nI am a \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d type learner. Very visual. \nI love just sitting in a class and listening to theory, then discussing it with my classmates. I absolutely need that outlet to process my newfound knowledge, or else I feel like I go insane. \nCreativity always makes me happy, so that\u2019s also great. I love getting out of my head again and creative endeavors can help me do that as well. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\nI am great at coming up with new ideas and am not great at breaking it all up in manageable tasks. I need brainstorm sessions in order to be able to fill in all of the gaps I leave in at first. \nI love to improvise as well, going with the flow of life. \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\nThe description I provided under the question about my career already answers most of this. I aim to build a life that just breathes creativity, innovation and community. I struggle with the latter (could be my C-PTSD, lot of relational trauma). I need novelty and stability to me just means that I won\u2019t get into financial trouble when doing the things I long to do. It\u2019s not much about having X or Y. I\u2019d rather have less and do more than the other way around. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\nI fear not being of importance and not living up to my own full potential, I fear ending up alone because of this. It makes me uncomfortable to realize that most people have certain expectations of someone my age, since my timeline is so different from most people my age. I fear being misunderstood and undervalued because of this. \nI hate it when people are dehumanizing other people for any reason and I hate when I catch myself doing that exact thing. I hate being a hypocrite, but I also realize that this is all so human in and on it\u2019s own. I love that I can always come back to that realization. That, no matter what I do, I am always just human. And then I hate that most people seem to fail to see things this way. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\nLike me being bubbly and excitable for a new project or idea that I\u2019ve come up or crossed paths with. Finding new courage and confidence in myself and being very expressive about that to the outer world. The way my own existence can make me want to dance and smile! \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\nLike my laying under my covers and not thinking or feeling much, just trying to fill the emptiness with snacks and doom scrolling. Not feeling connected to people at all, even losing my sense of having friends and loved ones. \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\nI daydream constantly, unless I\u2019m interacting with an actual person. I always daydream about real people and events and rarely about unrealistic fantasy worlds. Most of my daydreams are a mere reflection of my unmet needs, like the need to feel loved and appreciated, understood, even celebrated. \nI actively involve my surroundings in my daydreams, but also change the backdrop for the situation in my mind. It\u2019s a constant switch between the real world and other locations, it just depends on what the daydream is about. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\nI am already daydreaming about being with other people and turn this situation into a game. Like, we\u2019re in a escape room together and I start to interact with my characters and think about how each of them interacts with me in return. We\u2019d probably just end up in a deep convo. I might fall in love with one of the characters, but we can only express this through subtle body language, for the other people cannot find out. I dream about how she and I cannot wait until we\u2019re out of this empty room. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\nI tend to ask others for advice, since my own mind often isn\u2019t enough for me to figure things out. I also just love hearing other people\u2019s perspective on things in general. \nI can change my mind, but only once I feel like the decision is not in line with my own values (anymore). I often change my mind once I start to listen to my own gut feeling again. Then, I ask advice and eventually change direction. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\nDo I ever? I feel like my emotions are a constant, not sure if I ever even truly process them? I just attach meaning to the experience of the emotion, but that meaning ends up being linked to the experience that caused the emotion rather than the emotion itself. \nEmotions are my inner call for action, they are holy. But I am still learning how to attune to those calls. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\nYes, but only when I already know my thoughts and ideas around a subject are so vastly different that it\u2019d trigger them and create conflict. I avoid conflict like the plague. \nThat being said, I won\u2019t agree with the other person either in a situation like this. I\u2019d just actively listen to them, nod along and think to myself \u201cWow, this shit is fucked up\u201d. But I\u2019m also eager to learn how they came to this vision and often have to ability to just \u2018get\u2019 it based on what I\u2019ve analyzed about them or people similar to them. This is not always the truth of course and I need to learn to not judge too harshly. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\nI am more inclined to see where the rules can be broken before even trying to follow them. \nAnything that is presented to us as being set in stone should be challenged. I am a non-dualist by nature and believe the status quo is full of flaws and very dualistic in nature.", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}

Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\nHomeschooled, Christian extremist cult..

I don't speak to most people from my past.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it?

Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\nYes to a degree, I'm good with my hands and sense of balance but I'm not sporty \n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\nYes, I enjoy many kinds of mediums. I see all life as art, every good and bad thing are just shading and highlights of a peice that give it depth. Every person is like art to me. My life's work is be a human canvas. Every horrible thing I've been through just added to the story, so for me its all worth it. Pain is profound, happiness is beautiful, art would be boring without both.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\nPast only exists in our memory, memory is faulty thus we can not rely on it. The future doesn't even exist yet, we can only aim out trajectory and even then we cannot predict the future, thus its too many variables we cannot rely on it. The present is the only thing we have the power over to change and it's too beautiful to ignore.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)?

What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\nI have severe dyslexia and autism, I was homeschooled and learning was very hard. I often thought I understood something, would explain the process back, but when pen hit paper it was all wrong. It took me years to realize the disabilities I had but before I knew the truth I was determined to learn to read and read a whole book upside-down and have been able to read since. So to answer the question, I will fucking find a way to understand no matter what.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks?

{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\n20, female. I don't know how to describe myself.. I don't really have any perception of myself lol. I think I'm pretty calm and easygoing on the outside, but on the inside pretty chaotic and scattered. I'm a hermit, I don't really like to get involved with many people and prefer to spend my time reading or being at home.\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nGAD, depression, PTSD.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nEssentially I brought up myself, so I had no religious or structured influence. I tended to gravitate somewhat towards spirituality though, but never really deciding on any one religion or thought system in general. Even now, my view on spirituality and the world is less fixed. I take from a lot of different religious and spiritual systems to develop my belief system but it couldn't really be classified as anything. I think I just pretty much succumbed to the unstructured lifestyle, not really having a sleep schedule or eating regularly or anything. Growing up I kinda just did whatever I wanted whenever I felt like it. Even now I tend to do that, I have trouble sticking to a routine for very long or having any sort of schedule. I prefer to let things free flow.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI work in a grocery store. I don't really like it because most of the customers are pretty impatient and treat you like a robot. For me of course ideally I would not even want to work but I want money so it is what it is lol.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nMost of the time I end up feeling refreshed. Especially after a few days of socializing or working, I can't wait to just get home and sit on my computer and act like a potato for hours on end. Sometimes if I have a particularly social day at work it's the most relieving thing to just get off that shift.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI.. don't do sports at all. I am horrible at them.. they are boring.. and I don't really like competition at all. I like going on walks in nature though, but I wouldn't say I really do it a lot. I sometimes just like walking around in shopping areas just looking at things.. isn't that technically its own genre of exercise?\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am very curious about literally everything I hear about. If I even hear a word about something I've never heard about, I instantly go to research it. Sometimes to my detriment cause you know being on Reddit a lot you hear about a lot of strange rabbitholes. My ideas are both environmental and conceptual, sometimes I get an idea based on something I see in front of me and will follow it further, such as a health issue that I will delve into deeply and think about what I could do to cure it that might not be obvious. Other times I have very conceptual thoughts, some like I mentioned earlier about spirituality or the meaning of being alive, others maybe more philosophical but you could question if that is environmental or conceptual. I have a lot of ideas about what ifs, like what if we were living in a simulation, and if we were what are the signs that we are? But the thing is that all of that only leads to more questions and loose ends, so you can really question it forever.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI don't like leadership roles. I don't really like the concept of leadership in general because I think it tends to divide people and allows you to see certain people as better when they are just human. It also puts people in a position to pretend to act like they know everything, even if they don't have the answers. If I was to lead I would prefer to take a team approach, and instead let everybody brainstorm in a way that best suits their own strengths. I think one person can't have every strength, and so working as a team rather than with a leader will be the best way to maximize effectiveness and also prevent people from thinking that their work is not valuable and losing morale.\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI am not coordinated. I literally just cut off part of my finger slicing cheese because I was zoned off. I don't mind working with my hands but ideally not with sharp objects because I am prone to focusing on my thoughts over my body. I do like painting sometimes but not really. I would rather just use my phone or computer over any physical hobbies, but I do want to try developing more.\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI do like to write poems, but I don't do it very often. I love all forms of art. Especially music, poetry, and paintings. But I really love to look at it all. To look inside the mind of somebody else is very interesting to me. I also just like things that are visually beautiful lol.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past is something that haunts me. I try not to focus on it mostly, but sometimes it will come back with a vengeance. Mostly I just tend to remember things that were bad that happened, and what I can learn from them. Everything I go through has a lesson. I mostly try to focus myself on the present, but it's not always easy. I don't even think I tend to focus on any of the 3, but instead they just kinda pop into my head occasionally like hey remember this happened or remember to focus on what you are doing right now. With the future, it's also complicated because I tend to overthink a lot of what could happen. I'm always worrying about the future and what could be. But I tend not to think very long into my own personal future, but I do think about the impersonal future like when I'm thinking about the end of the world or how the Earth is going to flip on us or how aliens will show themselves or how the AI uprising will impact people etc. That kind of thing is interesting to me.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI will help people if they ask. I admit that I don't always want to, actually I mostly don't really want to. BUT I'm also just not going to be like NO I'm not going to help you. So I just do it. I do like to help people if they are having issues mentally, or if they need to be taken care of physically for reasons such as sickness etc. But with some stuff like HEY can you help me move this table or something I will do it but I don't particularly want to lol. I do a lot of things because I don't necessarily want to say no but I don't particularly want to do it either.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nThis one is tough because although I will always say yes to this question logic tends to mean different things to different people. I do what is logically consistent to me personally but some people might look at what I think is logical and view it as illogical or ineffective etc. I do what makes logical consistent sense to me but that might not be the same for everybody.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nNot very important. Sometimes I go kind of insane if I have to be too efficient or productive. I do try to get stuff done before the due date.. but that's just because it gives me anxiety if it's unfinished. Sometimes I do procrastinate very far, like I'll have a month to do something and I'll do it 5 hours before it's due. So I wouldn't really say that important at all because if I could avoid it I would.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI'm not really controlling at all. I think everybody should be allowed to be their own person. If I don't like what you are doing, I just won't involve you in my life. I still think everybody should have freedom. I might not always approve of what other people are doing, but I don't think it's really my place to tell them what to do. I only would if it's something that seriously crosses a line for me.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMy favorite hobbies are thinking about things, reading anything, browsing Reddit, and watching video essays. I also have a bad habit of scrolling too far on TikTok a lot. I like them because they are intellectually stimulating I guess? Like if I go too long without any mental stimulation I go a bit crazy. I also like blasting music at 100 and singing karaoke sometimes. Also eating. I like to go out to eat a lot lol. I don't think that's a hobby I'm pretty sure most people do that but.. these are the things that fill the majority of my life.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI can't do verbal learning. Everything will just get tossed into the trash because I am thinking of something else and then I realize I didn't hear anything the person just said. I do a lot better with just reading about things on my own time, I don't particularly try to memorize anything. It just happens or it doesn't, I find that forcing things to stick makes me forget them even quicker because I hate it so much. I do like creativity in my classes because it makes it more fun, and I also like hands on learning too because I think it's easier to remember something the more times that I do it.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI don't break up anything into anything. I just do improvise and let it happen. Everything I do, I do without a plan and just jump into it in hopes it works lol.\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI have no real aspirations. I just want to be happy. I want to have a family. And I want to be free to do the things that I want to do without feeling bound to anything in particular, apart from people who I care about.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nWell I have GAD so practically everything makes me fearful and uncomfortable lol. I hate when creativity and uniqueness are stifled so that everybody can be the same. I think it's the worst thing how people would prefer to have everybody be the same and I can never understand the logic behind it. I know why institutions do it, so that they can control people and make them more malleable towards whatever agenda they have planned for people's lives. But when it comes to people doing it just because, is it because they are brainwashed that they refuse to believe that other people can be different than them and have it be ok? I can't understand it at all. Not everybody has to be the same. Not everybody has to think the same. It's almost like the greatness of being a species with intelligence is that we can do great things by doing things differently. I also hate it when people refuse to believe that their actions have consequences, or just refuse to believe that they are a problem or have a problem. Everybody has problems, but if you don't admit it you are just doing yourself a disservice by lying to yourself over and over. Self awareness is a good thing, and more people should have it.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe highs in my life are rare but they are nice when they exist. I'm very calm, very easygoing, I go deep into my hobbies, I tend to know exactly what I want and where I'm going with what I'm doing. I don't have any dissatisfaction with my life.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI get extremely emotional. I question pretty much everything about my life, wondering if what I'm doing is really best and if I should change. I get very anxious, and I also doubt myself and my perception of reality entirely.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nNot attached to reality at all. I try so hard to be focused on the moment, I try different grounding exercises, etc. I just end up going back to being in my head all the time. I am very unaware of my surroundings and people always make fun of me for it lol. I always miss the most obvious shit. ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M INTENSELY DAYDREAMING. But I am pretty much all the time so it does not bode well. I just think the external world is extremely boring and mundane. My head is a lot more interesting lol.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nPretty much the same things I always think about. Theories about existence, the universe, and life. I also like to think about psychology and behavioral patterns or philosophy. I'll also think about things I've previously read. Pretty much everything I can think of will cross my mind, especially if I have nothing else to do.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nWell. I never keep any of my decisions because I make them in one second and then switch them one second later it seems like. So not very long.. but I also change my mind pretty soon after. I have a hard time settling on one thing.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me awhile to process emotions. I try to acknowledge them as soon as I can, but as far as processing and dealing with them it can take MONTHS. It's a pretty slow process at times. Some things I still haven't fully processed or quite gotten over, because I just tend to push my feelings down a lot of the time or tell myself to just move on. Sometimes I think pushing them down is for the better, but then by the time you realize it isn't it's hard to pick it up again because they've cemented themselves.\n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI don't really like to force myself to agree with people, but sometimes if I'm talking to someone whose a bit more sensitive I will try to avoid saying certain things so that they don't get upset or a fight starts. I guess the key is to just know your audience, but I tend to not like to do it. Sometimes I will though in cases where if I agree with someone they will keep talking about a subject, because I like to hear peoples thoughts on things and sometimes if you act like you know they won't keep telling you.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't really give any fucks about rules lol. I don't know the rules anywhere I go, typically rules don't matter that much as long as you are not being an asshole I notice. But I don't care and will break rules often probably just because I don't pay attention to them. I think it depends on the authority figure we are talking about. One person might not know everything and that's fine, and in that case they can be challenged. But I also don't think you can diminish somebodies potential for knowledge just because they are authority, like saying EVERY SINGLE AUTHORITATIVE FIGURE SHOULD BE CHALLENGED. That just seems stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you anyone who can help! I appreciate it if you took the time to read this.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

How do you deal with them?\n\nI honor the past, but I'd prefer if I didn't get stuck on it. I like the present, though it's hard for me to live in it. The future is gloomy to me, but I dwell on it the most.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI would help immediately if they're close to me, or if the situation is dire. If they aren't and I still decide to help, it's probably because I can sympathize, or for my own benefit. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes. Without logic everything just falls into disorder.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery, but I slack off a lot. It's probably stress or I'm just sabotaging my own life, which I beat myself up a lot for.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI guess so. Many have said that.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nA long time. They're important, but I have a tendency to suppress them for efficiency. Responsibilities are most important.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nYes. They should be challenged because they're not perfect. I break rules when they don't make sense or have no consideration for human, environmental, and animal rights.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Kinda confused if I'm an ENFJ or ENTJ since I took several personality tests such as 16p and cognitive functions. With the 16p, thinking and feeling had a 51/49 ratio making me ENTJ, while cognitive functions said I was ENFJ.\n\nTo give y'all more info:\n- People see me as a talkative person with lots of interests.\n- They percieve me as nice, outgoing, easy to talk to, and a great teammate \n- I have a lot of random topics that spark my interests such as creepypasta, cooking videos, and theories.\n- I can usually tell how a person is feeling with a  first glance\n- I admit I'm a procrastinator but try to help as much as possible\n- My mood can change very quickly, especially if people try to annoy me. \n- I don't like being pushed with quick decision making. I need time to think.\n- I usually avoid leadership in group projects but if no one is willing to volunteer, might as well do it.\n- I am a nerd with topics I love. I can talk about a show for an hour if people don't mind.\n- When my friends need to rant, most of the time they chat me to give them advice.\n- I know when someone I'm familiar with is not in the happiest mood.\n- Under stress I have tendencies to either burst  with several rants or try to multitask while being irrational with decision making.\n- Music is my therapy, especially hip hop.\n- I am sometimes an impatient person.\n- I don't like unimportant conflicts such as groupmates fighting among each other since I just wanna get the work done.\n- Not much of a gossiper.\n- Your secret's safe with me type of guy.", "clean_guess": "ENFJ", "llm_guess": " ENFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hey everyone! Could I get some help?\n\nI've been trying to type myself for years but I really can't identify my functions, however, I've seen some traits that might indicate Ni and Se (I just can't place them in the stack):\n\n- I'm exceptionally good at finding patterns, I pay a lot of attention to details and try to understand things around me by finding and explaining said patterns. I can easily predict people's reactions and learn their routines, I kinda ruin the excitement of meeting new people since I read them like an open book right after meeting them. \n\n- I have a taste for aesthetically pleasing things, although I'm a very practical person (I wouldn't buy anything just because it's pretty, I need to be able to use it too).

{"submission": "I\u2019ve  been into mbti for two years and for a long time I thought I was an intp. But recently I\u2019ve been learning more about cognitive functions and I\u2019m starting to call that into question since I lean into some fi traits. I\u2019ve done a lot of research, yet I\u2019m still confused, because I can see both fi and ti with in me. I\u2019m leaning toward intp, though I don\u2019t trust my judgement, because I believe I might be biased. Also I suffer from some mental illnesses and disabilities, so that might be skewing my perspective. So I\u2019m reaching to this subreddit as a last resort.\n\n* For starters, I believe I\u2019m a bit argumentative. During conflict I usually won\u2019t back down unless the other person admits their wrong or I realize I was wrong (I almost never \u2018agree to disagree\u2019). But only on certain topics that I\u2019m passionate about and that I truly believe I\u2019m right about. Also I\u2019m pretty keen on pointing out logical fallacies in arguments. But I also hate debates, because of how mentally and emotionally taxing they are.\n* If I\u2019m met with a subject that I\u2019m not knowledgeable on or on the fence about I usually try to get the perspectives of other people on both sides and try to do research on it.\n* In my head I like to come up with stories and fantasies, but I also like to reevaluate my thoughts and opinions on real world situations.\n* Since I spend a lot of time in my head just thinking I sometimes miss things right in front of me, so I come across as forgetful and absentminded.\n* I think a lot about how certain structures in our society affect who we are and what we believe is normal (For example how gender socialization affects how men and women interact with the world differently)\n* I\u2019m usually very stoic the only intense emotions I tend to feel are anger and sadness, but I try not to let it show especially not in public. I get a bit grossed out with conversations having to do with emotions. (For example a lot of adults in my life have confronted me about my mental health, but i usually don\u2019t say anything or I tell them that I\u2019m fine)\n* I struggle with keeping a conversation going and I\u2019m bad with small talk (even with close friends) unless it\u2019s a topic I\u2019m interested in. I sometimes even get annoyed when people approach me, because I hate talking. (I\u2019m severely socially inept lol). Despite this I still crave intimacy from another person. And I do somewhat care about other people but it\u2019s hard for me to express that.\n* I sometimes get obsessed with a certain topic  and I\u2019ll do a lot of research and collect knowledge about that topic I\u2019m interested in just for the sake of it.\n* As a child I was pretty critical about the social norms around me like gender roles and submitting to authority. And I constantly questioned why certain things were considered good and bad in society (I\u2019m still critical about social norms, but I\u2019m less rebellious than I was when I was younger)\n* Currently one of my biggest fears is the fear of judgement or rejection. And I sometimes tend to be sensitive to criticism. When I think I\u2019ve been wronged I get defensive and I become cold, rude and belittling. If I\u2019m pushed to my limit I can lash out violently.\n* Also I\u2019m into art and music I\u2019ve been drawing since 2nd grade and I\u2019ve been to art school. Now art is mainly just a hobby that I indulge in when ever I\u2019m bored. When drawing I enjoy the process and the final product (if it\u2019s good). With music I listen to it as a coping mechanism (sort of) to vent strong emotions if I\u2019m really upset about something. \n* When making decisions or forming opinions I try to come up with what is most logical regardless of how I actually feel. I\u2019m also pretty indecisive though \n* In my free time I like to watch video essays on random topics.\n* I grew up Muslim but I\u2019m now agnostic mainly because there\u2019s no real proof God exists but there\u2019s no real proof it doesn\u2019t, but even if it did I don\u2019t think I\u2019d really care.\n\nI\u2019ll stop here or else it\u2019d be too long. And I don\u2019t have any thing else important to add. Sorry if this is messy or if some of these points don\u2019t make sense it\u2019s hard to organize my thoughts on paper in a coherent manner. And I hope some of these don\u2019t seem too edgy. Anyways I\u2019m mainly stuck between intp and infp, but if you think I might be something else then I\u2019d appreciate if you shared why too.\n\n(again sorry that this is long and rambly)", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "uhh so my coworker and i got into a situationship but anyways that's for another sub... i'm wondering if you guys can help me type them? they said they don't remember what mbti they've gotten in the past, but my guess is leaning towards ENFJ or ENFP but could be something entirely different i'm not sure!! I'm personally an INFP and we get along sooo well it's kind of crazy how much we bounce off each other. Our humor matches well and we always know what the other is kind of thinking. A lot of our conversations are based on inside jokes and we like repeating what the other said in the past if that makes sense haha.\n\nHere are some of his traits:\n\n* At first glance he seems like a social extrovert to me, but he says he identifies more as an introvert. \n* He's extremely empathetic and gets along really well with everyone. He always acknowledges everyone and they all know him somehow. From day one I always thought he had a genuinely kind heart and warmth to him.\n* He loves sports, fitness, staying active. Huge granola guy and loves nature, earth, all of the above. \n* He's very crafty; good at building things and even used to do a lot of woodshop stuff like making chairs \n* He loves staying in the moment and having fun then and there\u2014 very present. One of my conversations with him was about me worrying about the future complications our relations could cause and that I have all these reasons why we can't pursue anything further. His argument was that I don't need to overthink so much and live in the moment\u2014 it doesn't have to be so serious and the future is uncertain so let loose. :T \n* Very adventurous and spontaneous now; he said in the past, he used to be pretty strict about being on time and expecting his friends to do the same, but over time he's learned to be more fluid.\n* He doesn't mind change at all and constantly seeks adventure; he moves around and once moved to a whole new state with just his van and had no job or house planned ahead. He says he doesn't worry about those things because it will all work out in the end.\n* Very open-end future for him; he never counts anything out and says he has all the time in the world to fulfill any of his dreams or anything he wants to do. \n* Some things he says a lot and lives by: \"It's not the end of the world\" \"No problems, no worries\" \"It's not a big deal\"\n* He remembers a lot of small details!!\n* He mentioned things always weirdly align for him\n* He likes to say he's a lover not a fighter lol; he's quite romantic and gentle but also very intense\n\nFrom my own analysis, I thought he most definitely had Fe and Se in his function stack, which is why ENFJ made the most sense to me. But it's tripping me up how much he doesn't really plan for anything and really go-with-the-flow which I feel contradicts the ENFJ's ability to plan around their goals and future. I'm not sure!!

{"submission": "\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\ni am 22 years old and i currently identify as female. i would consider myself more of a creative, i enjoy looking at art and making art of my own. i have a zest for learning, but i\u2019m not the greatest at analyzing or critically thinking which makes me feel inferior to others. i have been told i am considerate, kind, and that i have a calming energy that helps soothe others.\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nyes, i have ADHD-PI, chronic depression, and general anxiety.\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nmy upbringing was not supervised well; it lacked any religious influences and i grew up more under the eye of my aunt and uncle rather than my actual parents who kept me in line when the need arose. i would follow whatever they say because i recognized they knew better and that they only had my best interests at heart and mind. i was a complacent, passive, and sensitive child.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\ni do not currently have one, but if i had to choose it would be becoming a singer-songwriter if that counts for anything.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\ni would feel refreshed in most cases, although there are times where i will feel alone and in need of socializing or at the very least the company of other people. i find that there needs to be a balance of some sort for me and that balance is a central theme to my life.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\ni do not currently partake/enjoy in anything outdoorsy and never have sports-wise either, mainly just those of a indoor nature. i like to write poetry and lyrics, cook, read YA literature and others\u2019 poetry as well as philosophy/self-help books, and indulge in my spirituality in addition to studying astrology to better understand myself.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\ni can be curious, but most times not to the point of outwardly asking questions due to my social anxiety. i like to contemplate a multitude of things such as myself, my feelings (i have a hard time regulating and identifying them due to the ADHD), and existentialistic topics. i\u2019m oftentimes curious over how certain things function, how things came to be actualized in our reality, and over the behaviors/psychology of other individuals. my ideas tend to be conceptual\u2014 they typically revolve around more abstract and less tangible aspects of life. they make me feel crazy at times because they\u2019re not exactly your average joe\u2019s ways of thinking, and i often am reserved when sharing these ideas in fear of ridicule or misunderstanding.\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nno, i\u2019ve always pegged myself more as a follower than a leader (despite what my astrological birth chart says). i have too many insecurities to be good at it right now but if i were to be a leader, i\u2019d imagine my style would be compassionate and oriented towards what\u2019s best for the collective greater good, probably as long as it doesn\u2019t involve a loved one of mine too deeply.\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\ni\u2019m more clumsy than anything\u2014 my mind also has a predilection for being scattered with a patchy memory to boot. i like working with my hands occasionally, but i don\u2019t use them as often as i would like to. if i did, i\u2019d imagine myself making jewelry, painting, drawing, making cosplay, and cooking more intensively.\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\ni do consider myself artistic; my art can he abstract but can and has also invoked emotion within others. i do more appreciating than creating nowadays, but i wish to change that soon. i enjoy art that speaks to me on a spiritual level, art that makes me feel (and think things but more so feel), and art that inspires me.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\ni think both the past and future are illusions\u2014 they don\u2019t technically exist unless you give them the power to, and what we really only have is the present. i follow eckhart tolle\u2019s teachings on \u2018the power of now,\u2019 which state that time is a restraint and what eludes us from the truth that is the power in the present.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nnot necessarily, although i do think it can and does help. but ultimately i do not think as if everything needs logic assigned to it. i believe i lead more with my heart rather than my head.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\ni recognize that they are significant to reach goals, but i unfortunately am not as productive as i would like to be. if things do not require much effort at their core unless its to improve how others perceive me and to show off my creativity, then i am less inclined to expend it.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nmy hobbies are gaming, reading, writing, learning, divination, singing, songwriting, watching (contemporary, horror, fantasy, sci-fi) cinematography or anime, and exploring my surroundings when i feel safe enough or in the mood to do so. i like these hobbies because they help give me a sense of purpose in life and they keep me busy. they help shape who i am in a way, though i do also acknowledge that they do not entirely shape me.\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nmy learning style is linguistic and visual, and i struggle the most with solely auditory learning. i\u2019ve struggled with the average learning environment due to america\u2019s unfavorable education system for those with ADHD-PI. i prefer classes that involve my creativity the most because i value expression of self.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\ni am not remarkably good at strategizing. i usually get overwhelmed by the entirety of a project and thus procrastinate lmfao, but i try to break up projects into manageable tasks when i can. i don\u2019t improvise often but i do wing projects sometimes if instructions aren\u2019t clear to me.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nmy professional aspiration is to make a career/living out of singing and songwriting and personally-speaking, it would be to reach some level of spiritual enlightenment, find true love, and live the best life i can with what\u2019s at my disposal.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\ni fear others\u2019 perceptions of me being less than favorable. or for others to see me as a nuisance or dumb. i fear not being competent enough for society. people prying into my personal life or imposing their beliefs onto me make me uncomfortable. i hate being ignored due to my rejection sensitive dysphoria, and i hate narrow-mindedness and bigotry of any kind because i value acceptance and knowledge. i hate being a bother to others as well because i don\u2019t want to be perceived that way.\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni am not particularly attached to reality; i (maladaptively) daydream very often on a daily basis. i am not usually aware of my surroundings as well.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nfor important decisions, they can take me a very long time depending on the severity of significance. i try my best not to change my mind once i\u2019ve settled on something, so it rarely happens.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nprocessing my emotions take me a long while typically; they are integral to my being and i still don\u2019t understand them very well. they can control my life sometimes and i often bottle them up.\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nyes, more often than i would like to admit. i am just not confident in my argumentative abilities and i fear not articulating my points well enough as well as the pressure of time.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\ni\u2019m not a big rule-breaker and i believe authority knows better most of the time, but i also believe it is up to everyone\u2019s discretion whether they truly know better or not. it\u2019s a case-by-case basis i suppose.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

I went into a job not doing much research into it even tho I thought i did and now regret my life choices but too lazy to go back to school to do anything else. I lived with my mum all my life and when she went on holiday I found it kinda hard to do everything and was kinda stressed.

Also one of the reasons why I don\u2019t like myself. I used to move from schools to schools in different countries and in most schools I was quiet and shy and only in one school I went to I was truly happy. I hated when teachers and adults would say I was shy as if it was a bad thing also I felt like it inhibited me and if I was seen as  this then I would need to be shy. I really hated it. \n\nWhen I was in secondary school I was abit delusional and even tho I was in a maths top class I made my answers all wrong as I would drop into a lower grade and then I regretted it. For some reason I think I thought it was cool or something. I don\u2019t remember exactly why. Also I used to play video games a lot and only when I moved to another country school and wasn\u2019t seen as a shy child or something because I tried and only when I was happy then I started to focus on studied but I think I was also older by then.\n\nWhen I was being interviewed for a job or when at like an office Christmas party and let\u2019s say one of the senior members were talking I couldn\u2019t help but zone out and not be listening to them but instead be thinking what sort of person they would be like in a zombie apocalypse. Also I find it hard to concentrate when people are talking if the thing I deem is boring even though I know it\u2019s something important. I might look like I\u2019m listening and nodding even but my mind is elsewhere. \n\nPls ask me more questions I just simply wrote some stuff", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "So, I don't think I've done this before on Reddit, but this was my last resort since quizzes/tests don't really help me. (I just put my answers for that pinned post.)\n\n1. I'm only 13 years old, and I'm a female. I don't think I have much to say about myself, but I'm kind of mature for my age and I often don't talk a lot IRL because I find it hard to get the words out of my mouth easily unless I've rehearsed, or something. \n2. None that I'm aware of.\n3. My family isn't the most religious family on Earth, but they still do believe in God (we're Catholic). We go to church seldomly, like maybe a few times a month or when we have time to. If we're really busy, then we just light those candles. But I don't really have any faith in God. Like, I know that there must be a being that created the world but I don't practice any religious stuff unless my family wants to.\n4. I'm just a student and I don't really like it because of the schedule.\n5. An entire weekend by myself sounds interesting actually! Maybe I'd be refreshed for the first few days but would get anxious after that. I've always enjoyed being by myself most of the time (especially at home), but definitely not for a week.\n6. The activities I do don't require much physical work since I just lie down and play video games if I'm not busy with schoolwork. I do want to get into sports though, specifically soccer (even joined my school's football team for some sports festival). As for that, I sometimes play badminton outside, but only when someone asks me to play with them.\n7. I don't think I'm that curious, though people think I am. The word \"Why?\" comes out of my mouth a lot, at least. I do have a lot of ideas but I don't end up executing them unless I'm in the right mood/it's easy. I get curious about random stuff, really, but I don't pry whenever it's a serious or personal matter. Most of my curiosities are conceptual because I'm not so in touch with the environment.\n8. Taking on a leadership position is fine with me, though I wouldn't be the best at it. I'm definitely organized when delegating tasks and doing the project itself, but decision-making is kinda hard for me since I always get pressured to make the right decision. It usually takes me a while to make a decision and when I do make a decision, I change my mind a few minutes later. \n9. I'd like to think I'm coordinated. Some say I have a good reaction time, which I think is coordinated enough. I'm not sure what to put here though since I barely do any physical activity, lol.\n10. I'm not artistic, I just have the ideas. I think of an artwork/a story I wanna write but I never execute it because I'm not good at drawing or writing. \n11. I want to see myself as an \"I don't care about the past\" person, but I am. I always worry about stuff that's already happened and I'm cautious about not making those mistakes again (but I still do, sometimes). My head is always in the future too. I always think about what I should major in, what career path I should take, how I'll save my money once I do get a job... stuff like that. As for the present, I don't think about it much. I think I'm too worried about the past and the future that I tend to forget about the present.\n12. If someone asks for help then I'd first think if I am able to help them. If it's a small task or a task that I can certainly do, then of course I'd help them. If it's a more difficult task that I can't do/wouldn't bother doing, I'd politely tell them that I can't help.\n13. I do. I'm not that logical most of the time and I'm definitely not consistent (unless it's academics), so I also don't have logical consistency. \n14. Being efficient is definitely satisfying for me. Being able to take two birds down with one stone is enjoyable, but I don't think about it too much.\n15. I find myself unconsciously controlling others sometimes, and it's always for my benefit too. I'm not sure how or why I do it though, sorry.\n16. I don't have many hobbies aside from singing and playing video games. I enjoy playing video games with friends and many people have said that I'm good at singing so I keep doing it.\n17. I learn the most by repeatedly reading/saying something out loud since it helps me memorize the most. A learning style I struggle with the most though is listening (especially during online classes) since I have the attention span of a frog. I have to really force myself to listen so I can actually do that. I prefer classes that have memorization since I'm good at recalling and memorizing things, whether it be a poem, a statement, or a set of words.\n18. It takes me a while to strategize since I always consider the effort it'll take. Like I said before, I'm pretty good at delegating tasks equally. Improvisation is something I'm decent at, but I don't exactly use that method when it comes to strategizing.\n19. Be rich, be cool, get a lover. My aspirations are very simple and I'm not very ambitious.\n20. I have this weird fear of not belonging and getting left out. I always worry whether my friends don't actually want me to be in their friend group, or if they have a separate GC that I'm not in. It's stupid. Blatant racism, homophobia, misogyny, and people pointing out my flaws are the things that make me uncomfortable. I especially hate it when people point out an insecurity out loud and judge someone for that insecurity. I myself have a lot of insecurities (mostly about my physical appearance) so I don't like it when someone judges another unless it's justified.\n21. I sadly not have reached a \"high\" in my life yet. I don't want to say that I do since I'm still young and there's really not much I'm very passionate about.\n22. I think the \"lows\" in my life was the time I actually considered suicide. I was home alone and was crying my eyes out, literally about to drink bleach. I had to talk to an AI bot since I don't feel comfortable on finding comfort in actual people.\n23. I do daydream often. Whenever I do, I get kind of out of it, but I'm still partially aware of my surroundings. \n24. I would just lay down and start thinking about whatever, really. Multiple thoughts come into my mind, no matter how normal or personal it may be. I could start off thinking about what I want to eat, then suddenly reflect on my entire life, and then start to think about the future, then I'd think about life after death, then back to what I want to eat.\n25. People don't give me an opportunity to make an important decision because I take far too long to do so. When I do make an important decision, I start to second guess and then change it. It's pretty annoying, even to me.\n26. I don't think about my emotions too often and if I do, I don't do much about it. Like, if I'm sad and I know that, I would just try to distract myself until it becomes too overwhelming. Emotions are important to me, but I don't do anything about mine at all.\n27. I don't do that a lot. I have my own opinions and principles, so if the person I'm talking to doesn't respect that, then they aren't worth talking to. I wouldn't ridicule them for having their own opinion (unless it's something VERY PROBLEMATIC) so I expect them to do the same to me.\n28. I don't break the rules often unless I have to. Normally, I would say no, but the authority in my country right now and how the government operates is actually ridiculous. Sure, they would definitely know more than a 13-year-old girl who doesn't go outside, but the decisions some authorities make are becoming too inconsiderate and illogical right now.

{"submission": "Soft spoken the majority of the time but around certain people they can be chatty, can fake their excitement/extroversion if they\u2019re tired but don\u2019t want to make the person they\u2019re with feel bad. In a group they find themselves wondering what other people are thinking, and with every decision they make they consider how it\u2019ll impact the people involved, sometimes more than how the decision could benefit or affect themselves. they can do small talk (but don\u2019t enjoy it nearly as much as deeper conversations) but tend to talk more and go into more detail if it is a deeper conversation, they love to talk about things that would take most people a long time to bring up. They\u2019ve been described as humble and and very kind, and gift gifts to the people they love, but are also described as extremely introverted and quiet by other people. Most people describe them as kind but some have described them as a hard person to truly get to know, and someone who is sensitive and does not like being controlled. However, even when they are being controlled or mistreated, they tend to forgive the person who\u2019s manipulating them and stay despite being mistreated, because they still manage to see the \u201cgood\u201d in them. Avoid conflict at all costs, will go out of their way to avoid conflict, but when it comes to someone else they will fight fiercely to protect the other person and have no problem taking on whoever and whatever the problem is. People, sometimes strangers, open up to them easily and tell them things for no reason, out of no where, things that are deeply personal. They put others needs before their own, to the point they don\u2019t know who they are or what they want anymore, and have surprisingly weak boundaries. People have told them that they have a way of knowing what someone is going to say before they say it, some people find that unsettling. They\u2019re optimistic and love humanity most of the time, but also have trouble truly trusting other people, and can find themselves expecting the worst out of a situation and questioning other people\u2019s intentions. They\u2019ve frequently had hunches about people within the first few moments of meeting them that tend to be correct, they describe it as a feeling and say \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong, I know it. Something about so and so is off.\u201d And find themselves reading the persons body language, and eyes most of all, and are skilled at recognizing changes in the body language and incredibly good and reading someone\u2019s eyes. They\u2019ve been right about people being bad/not good people even if everyone around tells them that it\u2019s nonsense, and no one takes them seriously until they themselves see what this person sees. They love to learn things, crave adventure, something exciting. They are also described as lost in thought a lot, can be caught staring at a wall for minutes a time, listening to music and just thinking and or daydreaming. They\u2019re often the therapist of the friend group, and enjoy being able to listen to other people and help them with their issues, but can get burnt out easily and lash out if they take on other peoples problems too much. People pleaser tendencies, can have a bit of a savior complex at times, gets a little upset if their care for other people goes unappreciated. Overthinks chronically, wondering if anything they just said or did upset someone. Can have an all or nothing mentality sometimes. Craves being understood, attempts to have people understand them, even if said people are mistreating them because they\u2019re convinced that maybe if they try one more time it\u2019ll get through to them and they\u2019ll stop treating them this way.

I will put in a description about myself and I hope somebody will be able to type me!\n\nI am generally a quiet person and prefer to work by myself. I don't like talking a lot but if somebody starts a topic thats really interesting to me, I end up blabbering about it for half an hour. I'm really outgoing around my friends and like to entertain them, but in general I do not like it when everybody is paying attention at me. I have a hard time expressing my thoughts with people, as they are really complicated. I think a lot to myself about all the possibilities that could happen, and I tend to analyze people a lot. I am often detached from the outside world and get lost in my imaginary world. I get bored easily and start daydreaming about scenarios that I wish could happen. I am a creative person, I like to implement my imagination in real life, but a lot of the time I find myself procrastinating/having no energy to actually start a project or something. I tend to see many of the people around me as dumb for being illogical and not thinking outside the box. I lose patience with those who cannot keep up with me and get mad. I've never been an overly emotional person, I usually keep all my emotions to myself. If I'm angry at someone, I barely express it. I also think with my head instead of my heart. I always try to find the most logical solution in every problem. Usually, I don't like hanging out with many friends all at once, and I like to only spend time with one close friend. For memories, I always recall past events and memories when something happens, using past experience to guide me in the present. Please tell me if i need to add more info.

What would your leadership style be?\n\nI used to lead projects in school because I felt that if I didn't, I would fall behind or not get a good grade.

{"submission": "I\u2019ve been on the fence abt whether if I\u2019m an INTP or ISTP. Any advices on which one I can be? \n\nHere\u2019s a bit about me & what others say about me:\n\nMultiple professors have told me that I am very quiet, but very thoughtful. All of my critiques of others art pieces have been helpful and to the core (I attend an art school and critiques of everyone\u2019s work is a daily thing). A specific professor have also told me that she likes how I take a very intuitive approach to building my artwork, having an abstract idea and building my way up in an unconventional way.\n\nBecause my focus is in the arts, I\u2019ll be mostly talking in context of my work style in art. When I am given a topic to work on, my first thought is for it to be telling a story in a way that is not direct. It has to tell something, no matter what it is, but I will never present my idea on a silver platter for my audience. My process in creating the artwork, if I am proceeding with a technique I am not familiar with, I start off with what I know onto a path that I will figure out myself- I don\u2019t like to be constrained to a certain way of doing things, even if it might be the best way (Like sewing on wire, building a chair out of brittle sticks, etc\u2026 All sorts of concepts that I want to experiment on, that I somehow have a certain confidence will work out - though sometimes it doesn\u2019t). \n\nI work very differently when creating art compared to when I write essays. When creating art I am obsessed with the unconventional and the novel. But when writing things like essays I prefer to stick to a certain way of writing that makes sense - it\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t like to make something unique, but to me writing is something that is either comprehensible or not, and the most general must be the most understandable. My essays must be logically sound (as logical as it sounds to me - lots of people seems to not get my reasoning), but my artworks should not be.", "clean_guess": "ISTP", "llm_guess": " ISTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "More details in the comments. \n\n\n1) 16F\n\n2) I have always prided myself in being caring and kind to others. People always tell me how kind I am, and sometimes people even say I am the kindest person ever. This made me aspire to be deemed as the kindest person in the world when I was 11 years old, and I literally went around helping people in order to gain their approval. I still cringe about my attitude back then. This was something that I only did back then, and I only did that when I was 11 years old. \n\n3) when I was a kid, I was never organised. Seriously. I just wanted to do whatever I felt like doing. Though it is true that I have never been a risk-taker, and I only engaged in simple yet productive/fruitful activities like listening to music, writing, reading and so much more. Now, i am a very rigid person as i plan in my head the things I have to do during the day. It\u2019s almost a natural process for me to plan out what I want to do. Maybe I also did that as a kid too? \n\n4) I am rather sentimental. I love the feeling of nostalgia as a look back on my past memories. Reminiscing used to be one of my favourite hobbies. Now, my life is much more hectic, so I rarely have the time to reminisce fully. When reminiscing. I dont get the same nostalgia that I used to have, which honestly alarms me to a degree. I guess it\u2019s a sign that I\u2019m changing\u2026why is that alarming too? \n\n5) I hate taking risks. HATE it. The thought that I may DIE while doing the thrilling activity just irks me. I also dont Like Doing things like guessing what topic May come out in a test, or not studying a chapter before a test. I always prepare as much as possible to avoid any bad consequences. I also used to hate teasing or pranking my friends as I absolutely do not want to hurt their feelings and (esp) make them mad, leading to a conflict that I have to navigate through and stress about. I fear that things will end up rough between me and my friend, and end up stressing/catastrophising excessively as a result of it. I can only calm down once things go back to normal. \n\n6) I constantly need validation from others. Whether be it compliments, words of encouragement or approval of a decision, I constantly used to chase after my friends\u2019 opinions. I may be much more independent now, but I subconsciously still seek it. I just need some reassurance that I am indeed a good person, that I am indeed beautiful and that (esp for now) the decisions I make are reasonable and aren\u2019t stupid. When it comes to making decisions though, I am still more inclined to making them on my own. I just need validation from my friends, that\u2019s all. \n\n7) when someone criticises me, I have mixed reactions. I can get very defensive about those criticisms, and I can even start analysing each piece criticism my friends gave me in order to rebut/make sense of them. I even try to recall if their criticism 100% matches what I remember. I can be very hurt about it and May even question my self-worth as a result of it. One time, a friend of mine hurled insults at me, and soon my whole friend group left me. As a result, I kept wondering if I am truly worthy of having friends and if I am actually a good friend or not. I kept thinking that I am a toxic person to others and am someone who hurts people\u2019s feelings/someone who people disapprove of. I started to question if any of my friends view me as a good person. I even questioned if I am special to them/if they prefer others over me (admittedly I have the desire to be #1 to others). \n\n8) I have grown to become a rather objective and rational person. I try to use my logic than my emotions when it comes to making decisions, and I even try to use logic to understand things. I especially enjoy creating insights that are unique from others\u2019, as well as making connections between ideas in order to understand a concept better. It\u2019s always an internal process though, and the moment I try to verbalise my thoughts, my insights become marred with logical fallacies. \n\n9) I have always been a perfectionist. I zoom in on the details and try to make things perfect. This especially applies to myself. I have always been strict with myself about my English. I need it to be coherent and perfect. I assess my ability and progress in English - and actually anything - with my past memories.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

I do analyze people and my own behavior often, and I'm curious about that. I like researching specific topics I am interested in or something that I may partake in the future to the fullest.

I love it when I can just figure out a rule and apply it, or memorize it. I don't love very logic-intensive theoretical math classes but I do love solving math problems quickly and just getting the correct answer.

I have always loved drawing and painting since a young age. I'm also developing an interest in writing, which I consider an art form. Most of my paintings are attempts at realism and depict either myself or my family members. My study notes are kind of an art form too since I have very neat handwriting and enjoy making calligraphic titles.

How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past is something for me to learn from, and reflect on: unfortunately, it's easier for me to remember bad memories from the past. I have trouble keeping perspective in the present and often things seem to be brighter in the future. I have many goals and aspirations for the future. I used to have my entire medical career path planned out, but now I am unsure if I want to pursue medicine. \n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI usually try to help others fix problems if I know I have past experience, the skills, or the knowledge to do so. My thought process is I'm capable, so why not just help someone move past this problem? If someone I am close with asks for help, I will do so out of my own affection for them. \n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI'm not truly sure what this means but I do value doing things because they make sense. I don't see the point in putting in work into something for example, if it isn't logically the correct course of action. \n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nVery important. I have many goals and an overloaded schedule. Without efficiency and productivity, I would not be able to get what I want. I sometimes do procrastinate but nowhere near the levels of true procrastinators. My sister is an ESTJ and I admire how hard she always works: we both have different work routines and systems that we have catered to ourselves. \n\n* **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don't believe that I control others directly, however, people often open up to me for no apparent reason and I question why I have all this information about them. \n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI love reading, watching TV shows, painting, listening to music, playing board games, and occasionally writing. They just spark creativity, logic, or emotion. \n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI like to teach myself concepts through YouTube because I find that most teachers don't do the best job. I love it when I can just figure out a rule and apply it, or memorize it. I don't love very logic-intensive theoretical math classes but I do love solving math problems quickly and just getting the correct answer. I don't like learning random information either that feels unnecessary. I don't really engage with my physical senses when I'm learning and learning something physical, such as driving, is 100% so much harder for me then just memorizing a history lesson. \n\n* **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI usually make a rough plan on when I'm going to work on a project and write down my daily tasks in a planner. I don't make a step-by-step plan because I know I won't stick to it and I hate breaking down tasks. I'm usually an all-or-nothing person, so I just sit down and work until I'm finished. \n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI hate failure - it's my worst fear and the hardest thing to get over. I've been told I have a high ego and can't take criticism from people I love sometimes because I hate disappointing myself and others. Sensory intensive experiences with strangers like doctor's appointments make me uncomfortable. \n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nI feel calm and act logically. I'm productive and not on my phone.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nBinging junk food, procrastinating, using social media way too much, feeling empty or very insecure about everything. \n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI'm fairly attached to reality in that I don't daydream about surrealistic topics. I do think and reflect a lot on things that have happened or will happen in the future. I usually stare out a window or at one specific point when I do this. \n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nUsually, I have a gut feeling when I need to make a decision, but I do think about the decision fully before making it by weighing the pros and cons. I rarely change my mind or have regrets. \n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI find myself reflecting on my behavior a lot and I'm very self-regulatory. Emotions are a part of me but I don't make decisions based on them: I just acknowledge that I have certain emotional reactions to things and I learn from those experiences. \n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nOnly if they are an authoritative figure (like a teacher I can't piss off) or if I simply don't feel like fighting someone. Otherwise, I will make it known that I disagree if I do. ", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n  Im somewhat curious and will look more into topics im interested in. i have trouble coming up with ideas at times, so i usually like it when i find an idea for i know it wouldn;t have to compete against any other ideas to be executed. my curiosities either relate to my hobbies or are completely random.

{"submission": " I already have a good idea of what my type is, I just wanted to see if anyone else can possibly make any assumptions. This was written a couple of months ago.  \n**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI\u2019m an 18 year old girl. I\u2019m what someone would call an ambivert, but I really don\u2019t like using that term as everyone technically requires social interaction and alone time. I\u2019m more of an extrovert with huge NPC energy due to my terrible social anxiety.\n\nI have been told that I am ambitious, well-rounded, opinionated, creative and smart, but also arrogant, argumentative, and stubborn.\n\nI\u2019m very quiet normally, I mind my own business. When I\u2019m with my friends, I\u2019m super chatty and weird.\n\nI have been typed as an ExTx 3w2, but I\u2019m leaning towards ExTJ because of the fact that I prioritize Te over Fi.\n\n16p and those other tests that disguise themselves as cognitive function tests (which they are not- they prioritize letter dichotomies and then use the functions as part of the description later) have typed me as an IxTX.\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI\u2019ve had a depressive episode during late 2020-early 2022. Because of that, I have been diagnosed with depression. As of now, however, I am doing fine.\n\nAs a kid, I\u2019ve almost been diagnosed with ADHD because I did really badly during school. Turns out I was doing bad at school because I didn\u2019t care at the time. I\u2019ve also been diagnosed with generalised anxiety recently, and I suppose it makes sense, due to how fricken stressed out I am.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy mom\u2019s religious and it drives me nuts- not because she\u2019s religious, but because of the stupid shit she says. She\u2019s homophobic, racist, sexist, whatever you name it. She doesn\u2019t like it when I eat meat on a friday, and she uses God as a threat, saying that \u201cGod is watching you\u201d and that \u201cGod will punish you.\u201dMy dad just exists? Idk. I hang out with my cats more :)))\n\nI don\u2019t remember much from my childhood other than being bullied at school and being hit at home. I was a mixture of being bossy, hyperactive and arrogant as a kid, but all of that has toned down A LOT as an older teenager.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI\u2019m studying Biomedical Engineering. It wasn\u2019t my first choice: my first choice was to become a doctor, but to be honest, I wasn\u2019t too interested in becoming one.\n\nI like my major because it combines both medicine and engineering. It is a developing field and I get to apply the stuff I learn. In the end, it\u2019s worth it.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI normally feel lonely, I don\u2019t realize it until much MUCH later. I mostly focus on completing work and doing my hobbies.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI\u2019m more on the artsy side. I like to draw, paint, read, write fanfics, and play the piano. I do workout though, it helps me maintain myself and I temporarily feel better.\n\nI am planning on using some of these hobbies as a side hustle- namely the art.\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI suppose I am curious? I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nI\u2019m not curious for the sake of being curious, I\u2019m curious because I think it would be useful, which is why I like STEM a lot- it\u2019s a genuine interest of mine, and it pays out in the end. I tended to dislike subjects like history, geography and english lit because I didn\u2019t have a use for it- I may not see the use for it, but if someone else does, that\u2019s fine.\n\nAs for my ideas to execution ratio, I would say they are the same. I do tend to execute most of my ideas, except for the ones with bad consequences. They\u2019re mostly conceptual? I don\u2019t focus on the environment or helping people out for the sake of making the world a better place.\n\nThe only ideas I can think about are hobbies related, namely because I\u2019m trying to survive in school and do my best. When it comes to my hobbies, mostly story writing, I try to make systems and write my own lore.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI would enjoy taking on a leadership position, and as a university student who\u2019s still trying to get out of the effects of a two and a half year pandemic, it\u2019s a little hard, but I enjoy it. With experience, I would be good at it. I would make sure people get their stuff done on time, while being fair - I don\u2019t wanna be the reason why people don\u2019t wanna go to work. That has happened to me before and it sucks.\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI guess I am coordinated lol\n\nI do play the piano, but I depend more on my memory, thus, I suck at sight-reading. As an engineering student, I\u2019ve only worked with my hands in my Electric Circuit Analysis class, and it was my favourite class despite the math getting complicated near the end of the course.\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI am artistic. I don\u2019t draw for the sake of expressing my emotions- I have done that once and felt really uncomfortable. \n\nI draw for the sake of expressing ideas- If I think something is cool, then I will draw it, which is why I draw characters from my favourite games a lot.\n\nI\u2019m more into sparkly, magic things IG.\n\nWhen it comes to traditional artwork, I don\u2019t like abstract art too much. I\u2019ve seen some pieces that make no sense. I\u2019m more into artwork that conveys meaning or fanart of my favourite characters.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI have to admit, my childhood was shit, so I don\u2019t really hold too much value of the past. The only value I have is from the lessons I\u2019ve learned (eg. grades don\u2019t indicate intelligence, being a dick isn\u2019t cool, etc\u2026).\n\nThe present is something I usually try to focus on? I usually plan out for the next week or whatever. I do have a 5 year plan but not all the details worked out. I\u2019m slightly sucky at long term planning and \u201cpredicting the future\u201d.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI usually help them without hesitation, mostly because they ask me for help at something I\u2019m good at. For example, during high school, I used to top my math and science classes, and people would ask me for help because of that. I don\u2019t mind, until they take advantage of me or just leave me to get help from someone else. I don\u2019t know why I help them, I just help them because they asked for it I guess.\n\nThe only time I don\u2019t help people is in an area I\u2019m unfamiliar with, in that case, I just send them away to find another person.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes. If something doesn\u2019t make sense, I won\u2019t care about it. That is why I hate my mom\u2019s stupid traditions and stuff.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nThese things are very important- they cut back a lot of unnecessary work. Whenever there is a task, I usually look for an easier way to do it, and I end up getting more work done for the same quality.\n\nOne thing I keep in mind is to study smart, not hard.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don\u2019t think I control others? At least, not that I know of.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m working on a group project for uni, I make sure everyone does their part- I don\u2019t know if that is considered controlling.\n\nEven if I were to control others, I wouldn\u2019t micromanage them - they need to be creative to some extent but also get the work done.\n\nThe only thing I do however, is to push people to live up to their potential and offer solutions as part of their problems.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nAs I said, my hobbies are more on the artsy side. I mainly use them as a destressor from my STEM heavy lifestyle, and also I think it\u2019s good to be well-rounded and have lots of hobbies.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nVisual-kinesthetic?? Idk.\n\nI\u2019ve heard students learn effectively from all three learning styles, and frankly, most of my learning has been visual up to now. Auditory learning isn\u2019t my style because all the info goes from one ear and out the other, and my memory is pretty shitty, but if I practiced it with the other two, it would be good.\n\nThe only reason why I\u2019m majoring in biomed. engineering was because I picked up some random anatomy books as a kid, thought it was cool, and did some totally (unrelated) science experiments. School was so boring as a kid, and I didn\u2019t do good until the 7th grade, because that\u2019s when they started looking at my grades for high school.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI normally strategize whenever I\u2019m faced with a task, and I would say I\u2019m good at it. The only time when I wing projects and improvise is when I don\u2019t care about so much - hence my terribly written, last minute essays for english class.\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI want to be successful, and most of all, remembered.\n\nMy goals involve: getting enough credentials to put on my resume during uni and after that (masters in engineering and also one in business administration, and possibly a phd), becoming a successful engineer, and making sure all my hard work pays off.\n\nI have a personal goal, and it is to become the best version of myself: The pandemic didn\u2019t account for much of that, and now that I\u2019m in uni, I\u2019m breaking out of my shell little by little.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI guess somebody taking advantage of me. I don\u2019t normally emote a lot because I don\u2019t want anyone to know how I\u2019m feeling. But it\u2019s kinda bad to the point I don\u2019t realize my own feelings have been hurt when someone offends me. One thing that makes me uncomfortable is talking to people on a personal level, I guess that\u2019s another reason why I didn\u2019t settle on becoming a doctor- these guys talk to a lot of people and comfort them and etc\u2026\n\nI hate not living up to my fullest potential- which explains why I felt like shit and developed depressing feelings during the pandemic. I also hate it when others don\u2019t live up to their potential, and I criticize them (not out loud).\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the highs in my life look like- maybe it\u2019s when I accomplish something. I have won multiple awards for piano, academics, and other smaller things. It\u2019s not in the form of awards, but also personal things, like artwork. I treat art like I do regular work, and after having artblock for so long, completing something is a great accomplishment.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe biggest low for me was the pandemic. According to my doctor, I was despondent, lazy, unmotivated, and very blue. I lost sight of my goals and ate a lot of food and felt really lonely.\n\nI actually mistyped as an INTP because of that.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI guess I\u2019m a mix of being a daydreamer and being realistic. The only occurrence of me being realistic happens in my academic life - I anticipated that engineering school would be tough, and it is. I remember our class had a discussion about our first semester of uni so far, and some kids were talking about romanticizing studying and all that stuff, and I was like, how?\n\nI daydream when I\u2019m at home: I like to create stories and stuff. I normally spend a decent amount of time daydreaming until I realize I\u2019m hungry or something.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nIn a worst case scenario, I would have an existential crisis - I don\u2019t like being alone with my thoughts for far too long. Otherwise, I would probably daydream. It would still be weird to not do anything.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nNot that long. When I make an important decision, it\u2019s because I know it will benefit me in the future, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t make the decision in the first place. I can\u2019t think of examples of me changing my mind, but granted, my memory is shit.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me a very long time to process them. Just last month, I dropped a friend. I was very pissed off around her, and I didn\u2019t know why. The final straw was when she was being really bossy when discussing course selection, and in the end, she told me to quit biomedical engineering in favour of software engineering because \u201cit\u2019s the future\u201d (which biomed is too). That\u2019s when I realized, wait, I thought i hated this girl cuz she\u2019s ugly or something, but now I realize that she\u2019s a jerk and I was pissed whenever she\u2019d open her mouth.\n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNot that I can think of. I try to keep the conversation flowing naturally regardless of any opposing opinions, it makes the conversation more organic and interesting. For example, a friend asked me if I watch the world cup, and I told her, I\u2019m not really into that.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI\u2019m mostly a rule follower, unless the rules are stupid. There was a rule about not having bags in the science classroom in highschool, and I remember going on a very long rant about it. The principal (who was new) had a good reason to not bring backpacks in because of labs.

{"submission": "(I go on a huge rant here; I don\u2019t really follow any structure or specific questions so if it\u2019s not specific enough to what mbti measures, just let me know and I\u2019ll delete it and answer some questions, thank youuuu)\n\nHey\u2026 I\u2019m 16, male\u2026 \n\nUmmmm, I like to write? Sometimes? I need to be in a pretty specific state though, and it\u2019s not a lovely one. Although I do live for it in a way? It\u2019s very intense\u2026 it\u2019s one where I wonder whether my love or anything I do matters and I always come to the conclusion that no, of course it doesn\u2019t. And I hate it, I want to rebel against it\u2026 like a man growing angry at their old age: their bones are more frail, muscles are not what they used to be and now they struggle to do what they used to enjoy\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the inevitable\u2026 it encapsulates me in so much beauty. Trying to swim against a tide\u2026 trying to claw your way out of the void\u2026\n\nThe agonising yet alluring idea that we were thrust into this world against our own will: we gazed into a well, not full of water, but full of abyss. And the figure of chance stood beside us and, with an indifferent nudge, pushed us right in, where we would be thrust into a world characterised by the same sense of randomness; many even get thrust in and don't last a few minutes. The passion, the smouldering hatred against chance that a special few feel as the void envelopes them is one that I find tremendous beauty in. Scraping at the void and reaming at the one who pushed us in as we plummet deeper is a hopeless struggle, but I find beauty in acknowledging that and in spite of it, persisting because your soul says you must. Now, I don't find pure beauty in this alone, without any additional developments; it is foolish to waste one's life away scrapping at something that could never be. But I find incredible beauty in the immensity of the attempt; and even more so in the transition from such a powerful sense of obstinacy, into a solemn, accepting glide. Drifting with the same ardour as one tried to project into a climb. And in this, I find happiness.\n\nMan\u2026 there you go\u2026 that\u2019s the kind of mood writing puts me in\u2026 a realm of pure intensity, where it ironically feels as if everything is the same: pointless.\n\nI\u2019m also very damn judgey\u2026 like VERY. I despise overly-positive people; I despise the collective where everyone huddled together and does hand symbols and talks about why life is so beautiful and perfect\u2026 that shit annoys me. \n\nI also struggle with my own expression sometimes though, ironically, since you wouldn\u2019t expect that from someone who just said all that\u2026 but I really do, I dunno if it\u2019s a self-image thing or what? But I find it hard to \u201cjust do\u201d things? Like mentally, when I reflect on my expression I\u2019m like \u201cwhy?\u201d I don\u2019t see why I feel the need to say what I say and to write what I write. I\u2019ve always had the outlook that as people, we just kind of go on and on and on and on\u2026 like, there\u2019s this piece of clay and artists and the like come along and mould it into this and that and this and that and I suppose they have the right to do so, just as much as you and me but I don\u2019t see what effect it has? It\u2019s virtually the same thing every time\u2026 every love story, every song, every book\u2026 there\u2019s never anything truly unique that says something someone else hasn\u2019t said before; everyone reaches the same conclusion that life is about accepting and being happy; we all go down this same journey of expression, rebellion and into acceptance and it\u2019s pointless\u2026 it is.\n\nIt\u2019s the same lives that we\u2019re living just over and over and over and over\u2026 each of us just experiencing it for ourselves: childhood, school, first love, friends, heartbreak, parenthood etc.\n\nIt\u2019s just the same thing but each individual experiences it for \u201cthe first time\u201d - I guess this depends on your religious beliefs - and none of it is truly diverse or special but, I find such sadness yet beauty in the insignificance of everyone\u2019s experience in the grand scheme of things yet the significance that it all holds to the individual\u2026 I don\u2019t know how I feel about it or what to make of it if I\u2019m honest :/ I guess I\u2019m still figuring all that out.\n\nSee I\u2019ve always considered that emotions don\u2019t interest me\u2026 I\u2019ve always believed I really don\u2019t see too much depth in them because, I\u2019m honestly pretty sure they\u2019re archetypal as hell\u2026 but this shit? This interests me\u2026 and I suppose it is emotions? But to me it\u2019s more implications\u2026 but I guess that being said I\u2019m focusing more on my own reaction to it than anything\u2026 which makes me feel pretty damn selfish tbh haha\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 but after constantly seeing others doing the same thing, expressing the same shit over and over and then wanting to do it myself? I cant help but feel like a bit of a hypocrite. Even then, even if I wasn\u2019t critiquing it, it stills makes me feel selfish for believing I should express something that has already been expressed countless times\u2026.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm 18F. I'm someone who listens and talks, I talk for the sake of getting to know how the other person's brain work.

Why or why not?**\n\n I'm in my sophomore year of uni, majoring in architecture. (tbh i chose it because my friend said he can see me as an architect, dumb i know and i liked challenge) honestly I'm not sure if I like it or not at the moment. I thought of majoring in psychology since i like learning about why a person does this, but i dropped because my parents didnt see a future with psychology degree (in my country this field is pretty under developed)\n\n**\\* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?** \n\nsince i have two little siblings i think at first i would feel refreshed, but after i would miss them probably. i would be watching movies, playing games in peace. I spent my summer living in another country with my friends, but honestly when they were out i felt really lonely\n\n**\\* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?** \n\nindoors because even though i try to be athletic, im just too lazy for that. But i go to yoga because its  calming and you don't sweat, I hate sweating\n\n**\\* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\n i mean im not constantly curious, but i do have my moments. for example, if there are stairs at my school that i have never seen before, i would go up there to see where it would lead me. I like to know how other people perceive me since i dont really have my own sense of identity. I also like learning abt things that don't make sense, like the unknown, we don't rly know much abt the ocean which makes me curious, and i like things that are abt like ghosts and stuff like that, which u cant prove with science\n\n**\\* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?** \n\ni do like leadership positions because im good at managing things, or giving people tasks.

Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?** \n\nim not clumsy, i don't really get lost, (but its not always) since im pretty perceptive of my surroundings. i can find a store pretty quick, but sometimes i cant find it, when it's right in front of me. But when im inside a big store that sell the same item of different variants, my brain stops working. Since I'm majoring in architecture, i draw a lot and make models a lot, but honestly i don't really have an opinion about it since its something i have to do in order to get a grade. But to be completely honest, im pretty bad at making models compared to my friends, im pretty average at drawing too\n\n**\\* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI like listening to music a lot, but i cant think of myself creating music. I like meaningful songs i also like meaningless (but it doesn't mean like songs with weird beats and bad lyrics, its either good lyrics bad beat or good beat and bad lyrics) songs, i mostly enjoy witch craft and beautiful soundtracks from movies. My fav song atm is Jhene Aiko - Stay Ready, i really like the lyrics and her voice. I like songs that are new, I don't like kpop because they all seem repetitive, but also because they seem like they're doing it for relevance, money and not just for the sake of creating good music. I also like browsing Pinterest, and adding pictures that fit the vibe im looking for. I also like drawing, i imagine something so beautiful but the drawing i did\u2026. Well it\u2019s not what i expected it to look like, it looks so bad. My friends are really good at drawing architecture stuff, but im not on their level which makes me wonder if im just pursuing something that im not made for. There are kids that are worse than me but they are trying, unlike me. I think I'm not desperate enough\n\n**\\* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?** \n\nI don't really have an opinion about past, but sometimes i perceive people and analyze them, about present, i really try to enjoy it, but right now im dealing with issues about my future, so i tend to think a lot about the future. Im always making plans for the nearest future. When i don't plan my week it feels so wrong. I'm also making plans for months, right now I planned my life until September.

And yes there was no parking and I was right. And there are double doors where i live because it is cold in the winter, and i didn't know which ones were closed, so i js looked at where it was wet and followed it. I'm someone who learns from other's mistakes, because I hate failing\n\n**\\* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?** \n\ni try to be productive but im just lazy and phone addicted.

How and why do you do that?** \n\nI dont know if it counts but when im talking to someone who has upper hand, i tend to talk to them with like im a pitiful person, so they will feel the need to talk to me nicely and help me.

What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?** \n\nif i have to learn about some building materials i have to know what that thing does and how it feels like, and looks like, so when im imagining i can know what it is. im not good at straight-up memorizing, i can only memorize when i understand how that thing works or what's it about. When given assignment, I prefer assignments that give long deadline, and specific points on what I have to do and not just vague. I honestly do work better under pressure. \n\n**\\* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?** \n\nwhen im doing an assignment, i tend to plan how im gonna do that first, break it down into simpler terms and get to it. \n\n**\\* What's important to you and why?** \n\nEducation and health, no one can replace a skillful worker, living without worrying abt money. \n\n**\\* What are your aspirations?** \n\ni aspire to be someone like dick Grayson (corny i know), because he's emotionally mature and a good leader. \n\n**\\* What are your fears?

I\u2019ve always had the outlook that as people, we just kind of go on and on and on and on\u2026 like, there\u2019s this piece of clay and artists and the like come along and mould it into this and that and this and that and I suppose they have the right to do so, just as much as you and me but I don\u2019t see what effect it has? It\u2019s virtually the same thing every time\u2026 every love story, every song, every book\u2026 there\u2019s never anything truly unique that says something someone else hasn\u2019t said before; everyone reaches the same conclusion that life is about accepting and being happy; we all go down this same journey of expression, rebellion and into acceptance and it\u2019s pointless\u2026 it is.\n\nIt\u2019s the same lives that we\u2019re living just over and over and over and over\u2026 each of us just experiencing it for ourselves: childhood, school, first love, friends, heartbreak, parenthood etc.\n\nIt\u2019s just the same thing but each individual experiences it for \u201cthe first time\u201d - I guess this depends on your religious beliefs - and none of it is truly diverse or special but, I find such sadness yet beauty in the insignificance of everyone\u2019s experience in the grand scheme of things yet the significance that it all holds to the individual\u2026 I don\u2019t know how I feel about it or what to make of it if I\u2019m honest :/ I guess I\u2019m still figuring all that out.\n\nSee I\u2019ve always considered that emotions don\u2019t interest me\u2026 I\u2019ve always believed I really don\u2019t see too much depth in them because, I\u2019m honestly pretty sure they\u2019re archetypal as hell\u2026 but this shit? This interests me\u2026 and I suppose it is emotions? But to me it\u2019s more implications\u2026 but I guess that being said I\u2019m focusing more on my own reaction to it than anything\u2026 which makes me feel pretty damn selfish tbh haha\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 but after constantly seeing others doing the same thing, expressing the same shit over and over and then wanting to do it myself? I cant help but feel like a bit of a hypocrite. Even then, even if I wasn\u2019t critiquing it, it stills makes me feel selfish for believing I should express something that has already been expressed countless times\u2026.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": " \n\n17 Q\u2019s\n\n1. What\u2019s your biggest fear?\u00a0\n\nI think that my biggest fear is probably either not living up to my potential or not living my best life and regretting most of my life/life decisions\n\n1. What\u2019s your biggest desire?\n\nTo be happy/be my best self\n\n1. What are you \u2018\u2019the best\u2019\u2019 at?\n\nI\u2019m not \u201cthe best\u201d at anything in particular, I think that I\u2019m pretty good at a lot of things but I can always think of someone that does the things that I\u2019m good at that is better than me\n\n1. How do you see yourself right now?\n\nI see myself as a total mess that can either clean up my act, focus, and do the work to figure out my life and what I want out of life, or I can like fail and die I guess idk\n\n1. How do you see yourself 5 years from now?\n\nI see myself out of college, but debating if I want to go even further with my education or to start a career with the degree that I receive and focusing on my career in that sense. Maybe I\u2019m finally in a relationship/have been in a relationship and travel in my free time with them\n\n1. How do you express yourself?\n\nHumor and connections to fiction that I like (talking about it with others, relating myself or others to characters I like, relating things to themes of stories I like, etc)\n\n1. How do you feel about those near you (family, friends)?\n\nMy family is complicated, I used to like the ones that died, but now I have issues with them due to things I\u2019ve found out, I don\u2019t talk to some of them, and I have a good relationship with my mom (but I do blame her for some things), my relationship to my sibling is good (we have an age gap so its as good as it can be for our ages) and my dad is extremely complicated (our personalities don\u2019t clash and I have authority issues \\[from him\\]). My friends are good, I am selective with my friends so I mostly don\u2019t have issues with them and we have good relationships \n\n1. How do you feel about strangers?\n\nI try to keep to myself, but I often find them tedious and annoying, but if I have to deal with them I do it in a friendly manner\n\n1. How do you view change/uncertainty?\u00a0\n\nI think that change is good, if you\u2019re not changing you\u2019re dead. Uncertainty, however, is scary. While I don\u2019t mind change having a feel for what\u2019s going to happen makes me feel better than being absolutely uncertain\n\n1. How do you make decisions?\n\nI think that it depends on the issue, but I either run through all the angles that I can think of, come up with the pros and the cons of the situation, and make a decision. If I think it\u2019s more complex I will ask others what they think just to make sure I am thinking about the issue correctly and ultimately make a decision\n\n1. How do you solve logical problems?\n\nSort of the same on how I make decisions in general\n\n1. How do you deal with your emotions?\u00a0\n\nI think about what I\u2019m feeling, or if I\u2019m feeling spicy I just feel it, and I will talk to my closest of friends about it, but I also will distract myself with activities I do like reading, or climbing, or anything really to get out of feeling negative emotions\n\n1. What drives you in life? What do you look for?\u00a0\n\nMy own well being and happiness as well as being the best/well educated/healthiest version of myself that I can possibly be. I want to ultimately be happy and be able to be independent and completely stand on my own for reliance and my own enjoyment\n\n1. What do you hope to accomplish in your life?\n\nTo be the best me\n\n1. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you?\n\nI want to avoid falling into the traps many of my family members did and turning out like them and being miserable, angry, or toxic. I do not want to be one of those miserable old people that absolutely ruin the future for new generations. I want to be able to stand on my own, be independent, maintain my autonomy, expand my knowledge and experiences, and help people out when I can \n\n1. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself?\n\nI want others to see me as a good person who is intelligent and capable. And funny too. Like super funny. I see myself on the other hand as a mess just being propelled along by life\n\n1. Describe how you experience each of: a) Anger; b) Shame; c) Anxiety\n\nA) Intense anger I repress and get major headaches for, but I mostly just feel it and try to work it out through external hobbies or tasks\n\nB) I feel intense guilt/shame for different things I usually just sit with it and eventually get over\n\nC) I am perpetually anxious so I just live with it at this point and I can function with it unless it\u2019s absolutely terrible then I shut down for five minutes and then \u201cpuke and rally\u201d essentially \n\n26 Q\u2019s\u00a0\n\n1. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nIntense, I grew up in a very strict authoritarian type household where a lot of rules and expectations were placed upon me . It eased (a little) as I got older and after my sibling was born but it\u2019s still a little rough at times, especially since my father has an explosive temper and is very anal so a lot of stresses have been present in my Homelife for as long as I can remember\n\n1. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI work part time since I\u2019m a full-time college student. I hate it, it is tedious and annoying, and arguable beneath me, but it pays the bills and I don\u2019t have the time to find another right now\n\n1. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nAwesome. I love having the house to myself and being able to do whatever I want, and if I get lonely I can always go out or invite someone over, but I\u2019m typically content by myself \n\n1. What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like a mix of things both mental and physical and I cycle through a lot of hobbies. My most consistent ones are reading, watching movies, video games, photography, drawing, rock climbing, skateboarding, puzzles, and probably more that I\u2019m not thinking of right now\n\n1. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am very curious/inquisitive I ask a lot of questions constantly much to the chagrin of my friends and family. I definitely have a lot of ideas that I cannot execute due to practicality issues, but also the amount of ideas I generate and how the contradict other ideas. My ideas are more conceptual that environmental where I think about \n\n1. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo I hate leading people, not because I\u2019m necessarily bad at it, I usually do fine when I have to lead people, but people are such pains to deal with that I would rather do something myself or just go with the flow. My leadership style is more or less just communicating what needs to be done, getting it done as efficiently as possible, and making sure everyone\u2019s needs are met so they don\u2019t annoy me or others\n\n1. Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nKind of, I\u2019m decently coordinated but I had to really work on it because I was very clumsy and awkward and I still have my moments. Despite my shaky hands and dropping things I do like working with my hands when given the opportunity and that can encompass anything, whether it is just trying to fix something, drawing, climbing, or just something to stimulate my brain while doing something with my hands\n\n1. Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nKind of, I like to draw when I can and that\u2019s mostly just different faces and facial expressions, but I mostly take photos and that just encompasses anything that I think looks cool, or I doubt I will see again or will happen again\n\n1. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI have mixed feelings about the past, I am simultaneously scared of it and scared of repeating the same mistakes, and look back on it and miss the simpler more nostalgic times. Present I am just moseying along and being bounced around, and I am scared of messing up the future\n\n1. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf it\u2019s something not annoying to me I say I\u2019ll do it, but if it\u2019s something annoying I\u2019ll probably make a joke and do it anyways because I believe in helping people when I can and would probably feel guilty if I didn\u2019t help\n\n1. Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI guess?\n\n1. How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nPretty important, I like to do things as efficiently as I can, put as little in get as much as I can out kind of thing, but I kind of suck at the productivity thing\n\n1. Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t think that I am, I usually try to keep away/stay to my own devices, but I have been told that I\u2019m very convincing to others and have a bigger effect on them than I\u2019m aware of but I don\u2019t really know what that means and what they mean by that\n\n1. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI have a mix of hobbies, and I just like them because I find them stimulating to an extent and they provide a different mix to freshen up my life a little bit\n\n1. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is visual and tactile, I struggle when people tell me things at length because I space out a lot so if someone is droning on and on I will accidentally space out and get lost in my head. I do that a little bit with visual too but usually I get lost in the image so it still relates to what I\u2019m learning. I prefer classes that involve logic and creativity, memorization is boring, and physical senses are fine, but I find logical and creative tasks more interesting and fun \n\n1. How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI\u2019m pretty okay at it, not the best but better than average. I am good at mentally breaking down tasks and organizing how I want to do things, but (and this is why I think I suck at strategizing) I sometimes miss details or don\u2019t predict something right so then I have to improvise or wing it which I\u2019m good at. I live by the mental philosophy of plan where I can, improvise when I have to \\\\\n\n1. What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI\u2019m still figuring this part out. I just want to be happy and live a fulfilling life at this point\n\n1. What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy fears are probably being used, dying unhappy/unhappy fulfilled, and not living up to my potential. However thinking about my future and taking the steps to improve my life makes me uncomfortable and I don\u2019t really understand why yet. I hate people that are locked in their ways and aren\u2019t open to new ways of thinking, especially if they are locked into ways that are harmful to others\n\n1. What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have gotten a few school awards, and I got into a scholarship program at the school I\u2019m at right now. I got a few awards in wrestling when I did that too\n\n1. What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nGetting stuck in ruts and fighting my parents and just being alone and stumbling along in life, not really getting a break, but not moving forward in a meaningful way\n\n1. How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nMostly detached, I daydream very often, but I have gotten better at becoming more present and aware of reality as I\u2019ve gotten older, but that is something that I had to work on. When I daydream at home I am somewhat aware of my surroundings since I pace a lot, but I\u2019m not super aware I\u2019m just not bumping into things if that makes sense\n\n1. Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nFiction that I like, fake scenarios that are totally fictitious , scenarios that could happen, the meaning of life, or anything that comes to mind\n\n1. How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI try to gather as much information and as many perspectives as I can to ensure that I make the right decision and then I go into pros and cons. While trying to make a decision and weighing all of the factors I\u2019m pretty flexible to the influence of others, but when I make up my mind that\u2019s typically the end of discussion\n\n1. How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nA while, I\u2019ve always had a hard time feeling my emotions, or understanding why I\u2019m feeling the way that I feel, but emotions are important to me so I\u2019ve been trying to work on that\n\n1. Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYeah, not super often but I will to keep conversation going and it usually depends on the situation I\u2019m in, if I think I can have an enjoyable time being honest I\u2019ll be honest, but if I think the person or people will be annoying and I don\u2019t feel like dealing with them I\u2019ll just appease them to keep things going smoothly or just remove myself entirely. But I usually don\u2019t try to appease others\n\n1. Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nPretty often, but not huge rules, if I think something is stupid or pointless I will not go along with it. I do think that authority should be challenged because I have authority issues and also just value my personal everything\u2019s more than people trying to be in charge of me. I understand authority and do follow it (if I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid) but I question it often. This will often lead to the authority figures explaining themselves and I typically agree with what they\u2019re getting at and go along with them\n\n21 Q\u2019s\n\nPersonal concepts\n\n1. What is beauty? What is love?\u00a0\n\nBoth are relative, beauty is what anyone thinks is appealing, and love is how and individual feels intense care and affection towards things and people in their lives\n\n1. What are your most important values?\u00a0\n\nDoing what is right, being right, being a good person, and living the best life I can\n\n1. Do you have any sort of spiritual/religious beliefs, and why do you hold (or don't) those beliefs in the first place?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI\u2019m agnostic, I don\u2019t think any religion is right, but god things aren\u2019t testable so I can\u2019t prove there is or isn\u2019t one so any god can be the one whether we invented them or not, but it doesn\u2019t affect how I live my life so I don\u2019t particularly care\n\n1. Opinion on war and militaries? What is power to you?\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t like both, war is stupid and unfortunately profitable which is annoying, and in American at least, we put way too much stock in the military and we should divert those resources to other things. Power is influence or literal strength \n\nInterests\n\n1. What have you had long conversations about? What are your interests? Why?\u00a0\n\nEveryone, I like to discuss anything I can with those close to me. My interests are in fiction I like, science, climbing, philosophy, and general life stuff\n\n1. Interested in health/medicine as a conversation topic? Are you focused on your body?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYes, my mom is a nurse, close family friends are doctors, and I like science so I talk about it a lot with them and I enjoy talking about it. I am focused on my body because I like being healthy, or at least the idea of it\n\n1. What do you think of daily chores?\n\nBoring, but sometimes there is a weird comfort in doing some of them. But usually tedious\n\n1. Books or films you liked? Recently read/watched or otherwise.\u00a0\n\nI like a lot of books and movies and I\u2019ve seen/read a lot of them but the one\u2019s I like the most or have read/watched the most recently are the spider-man films, invincible the comic book series, fullmetal alchemist, jjk\n\n1. What has made you cry? What has made you smile? Why?\u00a0\n\nI usually can\u2019t cry, and I smile a lot but not usually because I\u2019m necessarily happy\n\n1. Where do you feel: at one with the environment/a sense of belonging?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t\n\nEvaluation & Behavior\n\n1. What have people seen as your weaknesses? What do you dislike about yourself?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nProcrastination. I dislike my lack of discipline and ability to sometimes do what needs to be done. I also just feel like I\u2019m lacking in all of my traits and can improve all around, which is good in the sense that I feel I can always improve and work on myself and gives me something to do, but bad when I\u2019m not feeling super hot\n\n1. What have people seen as your strengths? What do you like about yourself?                        \n Honestly I don\u2019t know what others see as my strengths, I feel like I\u2019m not typically talked to about my strengths and what I\u2019m good and, and if they do it\u2019s when I\u2019m not around. I think my strengths are my intelligence, creativity, wit, charm and I like all of those things about me\n2. In what areas of your life would you like help?\u00a0\n\nEmotionally, and with my future\n\n1. Ever feel stuck in a rut? If yes, describe the causes and your reaction to it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYeah, I\u2019m in one right now. Usually school or work or monotony cause them or a fight with my family and I usually just become detached and float around, being propelled through life kind of just feeling like an observer other than a participant\n\nPeople & Interactions\n\n1. What qualities do you most like and dislike in other people? What types do you get along with?\u00a0\n\nI like humor, blunt honesty, intelligence, and creativity in others, and I dislike people that are stuck in their ways, out of touch, delusional, and stupid. I can get along with anyone if I tried hard enough, it just depends on if I want to or not\n\n1. How do you feel about romance/sex? What qualities do you want in a partner?\n\nI strive for romance, I would love to be in a relationship with someone I really like, but I will prioritize myself and my life, and given where I\u2019m at right now it would be very hard to start a relationship that will last so there\u2019s no point really so I doubt that will happen anytime soon. As for sex I don\u2019t care about, but I\u2019ve also had some traumatize experiences in that department so that might be part of it. As for qualities in a partner I just want someone that I view as an equal, that has a sense of humor and is totally open and honest with me\n\n1. If you were to raise a child, what would be your main concerns, what measures would you take, and why?\n\nMy main concern would be if I was being a good enough parent and raising them in the best most optimal way for them and if I was providing a good enough environment for them to grow up in. I think there\u2019s a lot of experimentation and feeling it out since all kids are different, but I would study some parent books to raise them as best I can at first and then when they develop personalities and stuff I would have to go with the flow\n\n1. A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward and outward reaction?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI would question them and ask to explain and talk to them about it. And probably judge them\n\n1. Describe your relationship to society. How do you see people as a whole?\u00a0\n\nI would love to not live in a society and be totally on my own. I think people as a whole are annoying, but I have to deal with them so I try to make it enjoyable when I can. \n\n1. How do you choose your friends and how do you behave around them?\n\nI do it based on if I vibe with them and we bounce of each other well and if our beliefs generally line up\n\n1. How do you behave around strangers?\u00a0\n\nI avoid them when I can, but if I have to interact with them I am friendly and try to make the conversation as fun, interesting, and enjoyable as I can", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I first wanna say that I think I'm either INFP or ENFP and nothing else but I'm very indecisive.

I used to think I was trans (and I still wonder...) but I also enjoy stereo typically male things like mixed martial arts. \n\nI dont know if by \"general descriptions\" I'm supposed to think in terms of physical or psychological traits so I'll do both. I'm indecisive, I interact with people I dont know in a way that is reminiscent of a skittish cat of the type that runs away and hides under the table whenever visits come. I like the arts, all of them. I love art. I tend to lack confidence. Physically I'm not tall, I'm 5'8 or 1.73 for the non-americans (such as myself). I have brown somewhat curly hair. I'm thin and slightly muscular but I also do have a bit of fat. I'm shortsighted so I use glasses.\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nAutism, generalized anxiety disorder-\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nOoo MAMA! What a question. I remember being raised by my uncles and grandparents for a chunk of my childhood. They were subtly toxic but I was happy, somewhat. My mom took over my upbringing when I was a teenager and she's very religious and terrified of satan. She thinks nearly everything is satanic and has subliminal messages, and I shared her fears for some time. She's a woman that loves to point at other people's flaws and who has extreme emotional outbursts that she never apologies for or even acknowledges. My dad is passive. My experience growing as a teenager consisted of hiding in my room whenever they fought. Also whenever my mom got mad at me and treated me horribly my dad just sat quietly and let it happen. If I talked back he teamed up with her and then they both mistreated me.\n\nAlso my mom was in weird cults in my early childhood and at some point I remember going to a place far in the countryside and we had to wear these white biblical looking garments and we also had to venerate the mother earth, or something. I ate cat food that one time, out of my own volition. I remember liking it but I wouldn't do that again. Haha.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI do nothing. My dream is to draw for a living so I can live as a recluse, but I struggle with disciplining myself properly, which stunts my artistic development (basically I'm not skilled enough to get comms). I really wish I had better self regulation skills so I could practice all day everyday and get good in no time. I feel so ashamed of myself, of my uselessness. My high school friends all have their diplomas or jobs or something and I've got nothing. I tend to avoid them, even though I wanna talk to them. I'm terrified of being asked \"what have you been up to?\"\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI spent christmas and new year alone last year and LOVED IT. I felt profoundly free and happy I even started to dance around at some point.\n\n\u2022 \tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good  at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like to read and I like to know what other people think about everything so I tend to get sucked into comment sections of nearly every social media. I tend to engage with media just as a excuse to engage with the comments. I NEED to know what people think, I need my own thoughts to bounce off of everybody else's thoughts. I also like to draw and write. I write both stories and poetry. I draw original characters. I honestly tend to dislike the more technical aspect of the arts, I like the part where it consists of just emotional expression and exploration of ideas. I really dislike details.\n\nI also like to watch MMA. And I like to read books and watch movies.\n\n\u2022 \tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What  are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nMy ideas far surpass my skills and my commitment abilities which frustrates me constantly. My ideas are mostly just about situations. \"What would this character do if Y character did Z and then if X character said to another character something along the lines of 'what if (...)'\"\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNO. NO. NOOOOOOO. My leadership style would be \"uhhh... can someone else take over?\"\n\n\u2022 \tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you  enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI feel coordinated but most people will always tell that I'm not coordinated at all, but I'm feeling more coordinated as of lately because I do much more physical activity.\n\nI'm a super recluse so my physical activity is just dancing around my room or shadow boxing or doing calisthenics or using my single dumbbell or my single resistance band (I use it mostly for my hips, I wanna have a..GRRRRRRREAT ASSSSSSSSSSS)\n\n\u2022 \tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular  artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of  art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI kind of accidentally answered this already, but only kind of. I like to draw original characters, I like to write very very short stories like sub-flash fiction I mean. I like to write poetry and I do so in very direct ways such as\n\n\"Yummy yum\n\nI like ice cream\n\nYummu ice cream\n\nDAMN, so good\"\n\nI also like to engage in surrealistic automatism. I also keep a dream diary and like to get artistic inspiration from that.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI'm terrified of the future, resentful of many things of the past, and oddly kind of enjoying my present. I often think of Paulie Walnuts saying \"I'm alive, I'm survivin'\"\n\nI don't know how I exactly deal with anything, I'm extremely scatterbrained. I kind of just \"do things\". I often feel like if I managed to level up my organization abilities and executive function in general I'd do a lot of stuff.\n\n\u2022 \tHow do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI struggle to engage with my memories so this one question is making me a bit frustrated. Hmmm! It depends, when I'm busy I go \"wait a sec\", but more often than not I'll drop whatever I'm doing and go help, given that I know and trust the person asking me for help and that I like them also. Back when I lived with my parents I hated to help because they were so judgmental and awful in general.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI honestly don't know but I'm inclined to say yes.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery. My inability to be efficient and productive is very painful to me because I consider these things to be extremely important in life.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI dont think I do but I could be one of those people that are manipulative without realizing which is a great fear of mine.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nSpreading my opinions in the interwebz and creating and consuming art. I dont know why I like to do this, I just know it feels like my entire mind refuses to do anything else.\n\n\u2022 \tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you  struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?\n\nI hate memorization and In order to learn things I tend to just opt for direct engagement. So if I wanna learn how to draw, I draw. If I wanna learn an instrument I just play it. If I want to learn a language I just grind anki and duolingo and do lots of exposure until my brain just figures it out. I don't often think actively.\n\n\u2022\tHow good  are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable  tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you  go?\n\nI make plans and then I forget half of them (or simply dont feel like executing them to a T) and then I wing most of the activity.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI just wanna get enough money to live comfortably with ZERO need for other human beings at all.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nGetting a severe life changing (or ending) illness. Having to live with my parents again. I mean, those are my fears. I'm also afraid of humiliation which makes me afraid of people. I'm afraid of being misinterpreted. \n\nIt makes me uncomfortable when people think I have intentions that I do not have. I hate people who are dismissive and cruel.\n\nI don't often know why I feel the way I feel and I don't think about it at all, I just take my feelings and if I see nothing wrong with them then I just keep em rolling and try to do something about them.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nNot living with my parents.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nLiving with my parents, it felt like being kidnapped for years.\n\n\u2022 \tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of  your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream often and I'm sometimes completely unaware of my surroundings. There's been sometimes I've hit myself with furniture or something. It's a very common occurrence for me to be asked \"how'd you get that cut/bruise?\" and then I answer (completely earnestly): \"I dont know\"\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI imagined myself dancing around, then yelling to see if there's echo and then sitting and saying \"I'll just meditate forever and find enlightenment, there's really nothing else to do is there\" but then I get bored and frustrated and start walking back and forth trying to convince myself that there's something else. Then I start acting indecent for reasons I don't really understand.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI can take very long or impulsive make a random choice. I very often change my mind.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI have no idea how my emotion-processing process works but I really value my emotions.\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nOh yeah, but not completely. I often half-agree with people or give non-answers that don't really mean anything but sound like I made an statement. What can I say? I hate conflict, I don't like it when people get angry at me. Sometimes I'll tell the truth as peacefully as I can if I feel its important and the only possible right choice.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI only break rules accidentally, I usually try to follow them because I don't like to get in trouble. It's easy to say \"rules are meant to be broken\", but then you get punished.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hi there! I'm currently writing a character and I'm not sure what his MBTI type is. I'm gravitating towards INFP and ISTJ (his Fi and Si seem quite prominent) but I'm honestly not sure. Especially since some of his traits could be (indirectly) caused by his trauma. I hope my description will help. \n\nThe character is a guy in his 20s who survived a fire as a teen. His whole family died, except for him and his little sister (who he saved from death). Unfortunately, as a result of the fire he ended up with bad facial scarring, a few amputated fingers and PTSD. He's a difficult but at the same time very caring person that would risk his life for his friends and family. \nThe character's been raised by parents that cared a lot about living an eco-friendly lifestyle. During his adult life, he becomes a climate and animal rights activist. His morals are quite extreme (think: verbally attacking someone for using non-vegan shower gel, but even protesting at a friend's modelling show). He doesn't shy away from starting huge arguments, even with loved ones, which sometimes make him come off as very unfriendly. He doesn't see anything wrong with his behaviour though, because he believes he's making the world a better place. \nThe character is bad with change. He values routines in his everyday life and freaks out over small things like having the furniture rearranged. He likes things to stay the way they are and expects this from his loved ones too. For example, in the story he throws a scene when his friend cuts her hair without 'informing' him about this a few days in prior so he can mentally prepare himself for the change. \nHe tends to play the victim at all times, even when he knows he's in the wrong, can be manipulative and sometimes guilt trips people by bringing up his PTSD.", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": " ISTJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "(I go on a huge rant here; I don\u2019t really follow any structure or specific questions so if it\u2019s not specific enough to what mbti measures, just let me know and I\u2019ll delete it and answer some questions, thank youuuu)\n\nI\u2019m 16, male, I think I\u2019m an INXP? Although I\u2019m open to anything if I\u2019m honest.\n\nUmmmm, I like to write? Sometimes? I need to be in a pretty specific state though, and it\u2019s not a lovely one. Although I do live for it in a way? It\u2019s very intense\u2026 it\u2019s one where I wonder whether my love or anything I do matters and I always come to the conclusion that no, of course it doesn\u2019t. And I hate it, I want to rebel against it\u2026 like a man growing angry at their old age: their bones are more frail, muscles are not what they used to be and now they struggle to do what they used to enjoy\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the inevitable\u2026 it encapsulates me in so much beauty. Trying to swim against a tide\u2026 trying to claw your way out of the void\u2026\n\nThe agonising yet alluring idea that we were thrust into this world against our own will: we gazed into a well, not full of water, but full of abyss. And the figure of chance stood beside us and, with an indifferent nudge, pushed us right in, where we would be thrust into a world characterised by the same sense of randomness; many even get thrust in and don't last a few minutes. The passion, the smouldering hatred against chance that a special few feel as the void envelopes them is one that I find tremendous beauty in. Scraping at the void and reaming at the one who pushed us in as we plummet deeper is a hopeless struggle, but I find beauty in acknowledging that and in spite of it, persisting because your soul says you must. Now, I don't find pure beauty in this alone, without any additional developments; it is foolish to waste one's life away scrapping at something that could never be. But I find incredible beauty in the immensity of the attempt; and even more so in the transition from such a powerful sense of obstinacy, into a solemn, accepting glide. Drifting with the same ardour as one tried to project into a climb. And in this, I find happiness.\n\nMan\u2026 there you go\u2026 that\u2019s the kind of mood writing puts me in\u2026 a realm of pure intensity, where it ironically feels as if everything is the same: pointless.\n\nI\u2019m also very damn judgey\u2026 like VERY. I despise overly-positive people; I despise the collective where everyone huddled together and does hand symbols and talks about why life is so beautiful and perfect\u2026 that shit annoys me. \n\nI also struggle with my own expression sometimes though, ironically, since you wouldn\u2019t expect that from someone who just said all that\u2026 but I really do, I dunno if it\u2019s a self-image thing or what? But I find it hard to \u201cjust do\u201d things? Like mentally, when I reflect on my expression I\u2019m like \u201cwhy?\u201d I don\u2019t see why I feel the need to say what I say and to write what I write. I\u2019ve always had the outlook that as people, we just kind of go on and on and on and on\u2026 like, there\u2019s this piece of clay and artists and the like come along and mould it into this and that and this and that and I suppose they have the right to do so, just as much as you and me but I don\u2019t see what effect it has? It\u2019s virtually the same thing every time\u2026 every love story, every song, every book\u2026 there\u2019s never anything truly unique that says something someone else hasn\u2019t said before; everyone reaches the same conclusion that life is about accepting and being happy; we all go down this same journey of expression, rebellion and into acceptance and it\u2019s pointless\u2026 it is.\n\nIt\u2019s the same lives that we\u2019re living just over and over and over and over\u2026 each of us just experiencing it for ourselves: childhood, school, first love, friends, heartbreak, parenthood etc.\n\nIt\u2019s just the same thing but each individual experiences it for \u201cthe first time\u201d - I guess this depends on your religious beliefs - and none of it is truly diverse or special but, I find such sadness yet beauty in the insignificance of everyone\u2019s experience in the grand scheme of things yet the significance that it all holds to the individual\u2026 I don\u2019t know how I feel about it or what to make of it if I\u2019m honest :/ I guess I\u2019m still figuring all that out.\n\nSee I\u2019ve always considered that emotions don\u2019t interest me\u2026 I\u2019ve always believed I really don\u2019t see too much depth in them because, I\u2019m honestly pretty sure they\u2019re archetypal as hell\u2026 but this shit? This interests me\u2026 and I suppose it is emotions? But to me it\u2019s more implications\u2026 but I guess that being said I\u2019m focusing more on my own reaction to it than anything\u2026 which makes me feel pretty damn selfish tbh haha\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 but after constantly seeing others doing the same thing, expressing the same shit over and over and then wanting to do it myself? I cant help but feel like a bit of a hypocrite. Even then, even if I wasn\u2019t critiquing it, it stills makes me feel selfish for believing I should express something that has already been expressed countless times\u2026.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "* How old are you? What\u2019s your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n18F. Suspected enneagram 8w7. Not sure what else to say here lmfao.\n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI grew up in a Christian family. In my family, they make it a known taboo to believe in any kind of theology but Christianity. It was kind of forced upon me for my entire life. I assimilated into it, to avoid being alienated from my family, but inside I have always been skeptical about religion. Any time I criticized the religion to my mother\u2019s face, I was treated like my perspective was invalid, told to shut up and continued getting Christianity shoveled down my throat. It makes me quite angry to think about it, and I resent any kind of \u201cecho-chamber\u201d belief system, to this day. Whether it be religion, politics, or what have you. At first I suppressed my inner critic, and followed the herd to avoid being invalidated, but in my teenage years I\u2019ve become much more outspoken about my perspectives and I enjoy debating and discussing topics with people. I feel like I can get a bit aggressive at times, though. I like to MAKE SURE people hear my point of view, for example I\u2019ve gotten so in depth about expressing my point that it leaves the person I\u2019m speaking to feeling bewildered and attacked, even though that wasn\u2019t my intention. I think this habit is fueled by the anger that\u2019s been embedded into me from all the time I spent with a metaphorical muzzle on my face as a child.\n\nMy family is also pretty emotionally distant, and that\u2019s rubbed off on me. They never really said \u201cI love you\u201d to me, or spent much time bonding with me, and I think it\u2019s made me into a very detached and isolated personality. I tend to suppress my emotions because I feel they are insignificant, and my friends have complained to me that I\u2019m emotionally distant. I once had a friend look me in the eyes, dead serious, tell me that I should get evaluated for \u201csociopathic tendencies.\u201d It cracked me up. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a sociopath haha, but it definitely got me thinking about how my behavior affects people. I try to be more friendly, and am getting more comfortable with expressing my emotions now.\n\n* What do you do as a job or career? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI work at a grocery store. I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on it. I\u2019m just doing what I gotta do to get money. I suppose it\u2019s nice to socialize a bit. I\u2019d rather be out getting crossfaded but whateverrrr\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude0b. Joking, not joking lmao. I\u2019m going to school for graphic design. And it would be a dream come true for me to make a living off my music one day, but I gotta focus on a more stable career for now.\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nSounds good to me. I usually prefer to be alone, anyway. (Not that I don\u2019t enjoy a good party lol). I\u2019d probably use that time to brush up on my guitar and music theory studies.\n\n* What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor activities?\n\nI have a lot of hobbies, because I like to keep myself busy. Mostly artistic kinds of stuff, like drawing, painting, macram\u00e9, and musical instruments. I\u2019m a great craftsman and I find pleasure in creating things. \n\nAs for sports, I\u2019m not huge on sports, but I am good at them. Right now I\u2019m only into weightlifting and yoga, but I played a lot of sports back in elementary and middle school, and I was always one of the best on my team. Made some good memories back then.\n\nOther outdoor activities, I like to go fishing, camping, hiking, biking whatever else you see people doing in North Face advertisements. I\u2019ll never turn down an opportunity to spend some time in nature.\n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would say that I\u2019m moderately curious. It really depends on if the topic at hand is something that interests me and/or is important or not. I will either be completely uninterested or be all in on something. And I don\u2019t think I have more ideas than I can execute. I take my ideas and projects one at a time, and am locked-in focused on it until completion. My ideas are conceptual, I am a creative and a visionary and I like to first consider the meaning and purpose behind the things I do/create.\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would be your leadership style?\n\nI\u2019m indifferent to taking leadership, but yes, I am good at it. I often tend to naturally gravitate toward leadership positions, because I\u2019m typically the most fit for that kind of role in a group setting. I would like to efficiently execute plans and ideas, and make sure everyone\u2019s needs and perspectives are accounted for, without sacrificing the quality of the group.\n\n* Are you coordinated?\n\nYes. Very much so. I think you can tell from my previous responses, that I am quite physical and coordinated. I\u2019m not really sure what else to say.\n\n* Are you artistic?\n\nYes, again, very much so. Art is my favorite thing in life. It\u2019s my biggest talent. However, I feel my art kind of differs from what most people think of when they hear \u201cart\u201d. I\u2019ve noticed most artists create from a place of extreme emotion or passion, and are highly in tune with their own feelings and interests. That\u2019s not exactly the case for me. I prefer to take a more methodical and practical approach to my art, and convey a message or practical purpose, rather than an emotion or idea. For example, in the past I have been big into anime and manga, and I wanted to illustrate my own manga, so I studied anatomy, color theory, perspective, and etc. I got very good at the more practical side of art, if that makes any sense.\n\n* What\u2019s your opinion about past, present and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nUm\u2026 I guess I don\u2019t really have an \u201copinion\u201d on that? The past, present, and future are just kind of, things that exist. I live with em, I guess?\n\n* How do you act when other\u2019s request your help? If you would decide to help them, why?\n\nFirst I would evaluate wether or not it\u2019s worth my time and/or effort to help them, then if I decide to help, I would help because it\u2019s quicker and easier to get things done with two people rather than one, and it\u2019s cool to be nice and help people out.\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes. If something doesn\u2019t make logical sense to me, I won\u2019t accept it.\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI\u2019m pretty laid-back, productivity isn\u2019t always my main concern, but I\u2019m not unproductive either.\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI mean, not really. I don\u2019t know why anyone would want to control someone, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want anyone controlling me.\n\nNow that I think about it, I can sometimes be quite persuasive / demanding, carefully picking out how I do or say things to someone to manipulate their reaction, in pursuit of something I want. If that makes any sense.\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? \n\nI am a kinesthetic learner. I learn by doing things. I seem to learn easiest when I can get a logical and brief explanation followed by a hands-on type activity.\n\nI struggle when there isn\u2019t anything I can physically observe and/or do, like sitting down and listening to a teacher talk for an hour. I won\u2019t retain any of that shit man.\n\n* Are you good at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks?\n\nI\u2019d say so. It seems to be the most productive to break tasks into a bunch of smaller tasks / increments, that way the sense of completion and accomplishment comes with each increment, and keeps me motivated.\n\n* What are your aspirations in life?\n\nThe only aspiration I have is to master guitar, get better at singing and make a manageable career off of it.\n\n* what do \u201chighs\u201d look like in your life?\n\nI\u2019m usually actively engaged in the group, cheerful, and just want to spread love and support when I\u2019m at my highest. But I am simultaneously rational and confident in my own beliefs and opinions.\n\n* what do \u201clows\u201d look like in your life?\n\nAt my lowest, my bottled up emotions usually all burst out into a fit of anger, followed by depression. I will have a short outburst then mope around lol.\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what\u2019s around you? \n\nI never daydream. I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t have the gene or something lol. I don\u2019t really understand how someone could dream while fully awake.\n\n* Imagine you are in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI probably think about what I\u2019m gonna do when I get out of the room. Then I\u2019ll think about how I\u2019m gonna get out of the room. Then I\u2019ll get out of the room. That sounds boring asf.\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you\u2019ve made it?\n\nI like to carefully consider every option and potential outcome before I make an important decision. And because I\u2019m so careful about approaching the decision, I usually don\u2019t end up changing my mind.\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nNot long, usually. I don\u2019t really feel significant emotions very often. I try to be the best emotional support I can be for my loved ones though.\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes. Because sometimes my unsolicited input isn\u2019t necessary or productive to the conversation or relationship. And like I mentioned earlier, sometimes I\u2019ll carefully pick out how I say or react to things to get what I want.\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged?\n\nAbsolutely. I break rules when I think it\u2019s okay to. And if the authority is never challenged, nothing will ever improve, and injustices and inconsistencies will remain.", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": " ESTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I have been very intrigued with mbti lately taking multiple test. Although when I do them I always get INTP, INTJ and ISTJ. I did research on all of them and well they just dont sound like me. I got Intj 3 times already.\n\nI can see it, but its half and half. I have somewhat of a shy bubbly personality. People would describe me as quiet, shy and very nice. My close friends would say that im very friendly and sensitive.\n\nPerhaps its just the introvert me being only friendly and nice to my close friends. Because I know for fact if I were in a room with strangers even if they were my age or just my classmates you wouldnt see me with a bubbly personality. I would have my resting face on.(i have a resting bitch face) I wouldnt wanna talk unless someone striked a coversation first, but it would be awkward.\n\nI got INTP quite a bit in the past in multiple test. I even got Isfp Im quite artisy too. That was the past though. When I look at the results of Intuitive and Sensing its always half and half, but Intuitive is always more then sensing like. 49 sensing and 51 Intuitive.\n\nI work as a cashier as well and half the time im smiling striking a conversation every now and then. Most the time its awkward between the customer. Im friendly with my coworkers.\n\nIn the end I guess I could see myself as an INTJ. Its just the stereotypes around it just isnt me. I feel like I would probably be an INTJ  if I didnt know anyone and my friends werent with me. I even sometimes feel like im an Infj, but thats the rarest tell myself no that could never be me.

{"submission": "I know I'm some XXTP type (istp, intp, estp, and entp), but none have stood out on what fits me best. \n\nAbout me: I'm 19, AFAB, and genderqueer. I have ADHD and \"high functioning\" autism. I'm a college student majoring in animal sciences. I consider myself a passionate person. I do not care much for what others think of me. I talk a lot, and I'm very opinionated.\n\nAs a child, I did very well academically, but teachers (and parents) always had issues with my behavior. I got in trouble for blurting and not following instructions. My interest was art. I had a tough time making friends and my peers called me annoying. In 8th grade I joined the debate team. It was a good fit for me because I love a good discussion and don't back down from conflict. I was never in sports in high school because I just do not enjoy them and I've got a bad leg.\n\nI always feel like I've been inbetween an introvert and an extrovert. Technically I lean toward introverted because being around people wears me out, but I've got a high tolerance. People say I'm an extrovert because I'm so talkative and I'm definitely not shy. If I spend too much time by myself I get sad and lonely, if I spend too much time around others I get overwhelmed and can cry or lash out.\n\nI'd say I'm a curious person. I'll often have questions pop into my head but I forget to look them up. For example I'll see a squirrel and think \"What do they do all the time? Where do they go when I don't see them?\" but other times it's like \"how many times have I put on a shirt in my whole life?\". It's usually little things and I'm not worried about always knowing the answer. Some things you'll just never know. I ask a lot of \"why\" questions.\n\nIf I were in an empty blank room, I'd first ask \"Why am I here?\". Then \"How long will I be here? What am I waiting for?\". I'd look around and notice if the carpet is old or something like that. \n\nMy opinion about the past, present, and future is that the present matters the most. You're always living in the present and it's dumb to get into \"what ifs\" that either didn't happen or are extremely unlikely to happen. I don't mind it when it's plausible things, but the further away from reality the less interested I am.\n\nI've taken some philosophy classes and I enjoy it. It's fun to think about tricky questions and new perspectives. I like the Ship of Thesus but I don't like \"do we live in the Matrix?\" type questions. I can see why some people want to question reality but it seems pointless to me. It doesn't matter if we live in a simulation because there's no way to definitively prove it and even if you did it wouldn't change anything. I think philosophy can go down a rabbit hole of questions that can't and don't need to be answered. Like I said earlier, somethings you'll never know and that's okay.\n\nI like to keep my hands busy. I doodle in class while I'm listening. I work in the food industry and I'd rather make parts of orders than stand at the register. I also worked as a server and mostly enjoyed it. Something about following the same steps is really nice. \n\nIf you've got any more questions for me I'm happy to answer them :)", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": " ENTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Sorry this is going to be a long post :)\n\nI've been struggling to type myself because I've found lots of holes where I don't quite fit into the system. I understand this is supposed to happen to some degree since it can't entirely map out all aspects of a person's personality.\n\nContext:\n\n* I've been struggling to type myself, largely because after COVID I forgot how to socialise and created a whole new personality for interacting with others and how they would perceive me (something like ENFP, but this is not how I approach situations internally).\n* After COVID, there were two personality transformations that I made. There first when I became, I'd like to say quieter, but I really don't know, because my mum praised my cousin for being a quiet achiever (yeah, I know). The second was when was after my teachers kept saying I was to quiet, so I became more outspoken (that's the ENFP part)\n* I've always made objective decisions in some situations but about a year ago, that changed and I made a lot more objective decisions\n* I've typed INTP in a lot of different tests and I also resonate a lot with the 16Personalities description ( I know the test is inaccurate), like this statement for example: \"Imaginative and curious, Logician personalities can find endless fascination in the workings of their own mind.\"\n* I'm fairly introverted in new situations, I don't approach new people and keep to myself\n   * Example if you want to read it: My friend (ENTP) made 2 new friends after at an exam while I just spent the whole time staying at my seat eating a sandwich and eavesdropping on the people in front of me\n* When I'm in a comfortable situation (being acquainted/knowing around 50% of the people around me), I can be really extroverted and attempt to spark some form of conversation with almost anyone within this group\n\nNow onto the Cognitive Functions stuff\n\n* I'm definitely an intuitive - my Se is fairly weak unless I'm actively paying attention. I'm alright with Si, as usually when I'm trying to understand stuff, after developing an understanding, I will make connections with previous information\n* My Fe is also kind of wack because sometimes I can easily notice social dynamics and people's emotions fairly easily and have picked this up in situations where some of my friends (ISFJ and ESFJ in this case) haven't noticed. Other times this can completely fly over my head, especially when my Ti is most active\n   * just to show you how bad, here's an example (you can skip if you want, it's not really that relevant): After a test, Friend A was saying comforting words (i thought to) to friend B, who was crying but then went to hug friend C, and I was like \"Why are you hugging friend C?\" And then friend C turned with tears streaming down her face. Not one of my proudest moments and I felt so bad afterwards\n* My Fi is alright, I'd like to say that i am fairly aware of my emotions when they come, but i despise talking about them, especially more personal emotions. I also can be sensitive sometimes\n* My Te is also fairly strong to: in group projects, I like to take the lead and prefer it over following others, especially if I think I can do it better. I also get annoyed in projects if not everyone is completing their parts, but I guess everyone does to so yeah\n* My Ne is also fairly strong: I like to come up with new and random ideas and just run with it. But I don't really like brainstorming tasks, (which could be at fault of the assignment since I usually already know what I want to do).\n* I don't really get Ni so I'm just going to throw random information in hopes that it might help you\n   * When I meet people that I'm interested in, I like to create little profiles of them in my head. These are usually more deep then just your favourite colour or something:\n      * this person is regarded as \"smart\" because of their good grades but their scared they won't make it because they just memorise the details and don't really develop an understanding of whatever they are learning and thus won't be able to apply it (When I came to this conclusion I hadn't studied with that person before)\n      * (BTW I'm not trying to be creepy, I'm just trying to understand them better)\n      * I don't really know if this qualifies as Se or Ni but I play basketball and sometimes my brain kind of just maps out a path to follow thats usually leads to a goal. Mind you, I'm really not that good so this is always really exciting for me. I also have no idea how to spark this\n\nWow! This ended up really long!

{"submission": " This is gonna be long. Also, if you need more info, feel free to DM me! You people seem very smart and kind and I would love to hear your wisdom!\n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI'm not going to say my exact age or gender for privacy reasons, and because I don't want to make a big deal out of it. If you really need to know, I can share in DMs if I trust you. Usually I care a lot about my fashion, and I have to wear an outfit I like and clean myself to be confident. Apparently I'm a \"trendsetter\" but I don't really think so, I just enjoy wearing nice clothes and standing out sometimes!\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI was diagnosed as autistic but don't relate to other autistic people and I'm doubting it. I also got diagnosed with a cocktail of other things, but I think it all just boiled down to, I was lonely and no one gave me attention otherwise... I know that sounds bad, but there was no bad intentions.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nMy family was religious and when I was younger I remember being very fond of going to church and it was very comforting for me. I can't tell if it was actually church that comforted me, or getting to go to a place with a bunch of friendly people and my family. I even kept going with my grandparents when my parents quit coming (don't remember that time super vividly so might not be 100% accurate)\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nAt first I might be okay, but probably within a few hours I would start to get very lonely, depressed, and needing someone to talk to. My mental health immediately dips when I'm alone for too long.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI love all kinds of activities! I love to write, cook, bake, sew, walk outside, ride skateboards, and my current obsession is swimming. I get this weird thing in me when I do something where I can like feel the activity in my brain and how it feels and I NEED to go do it again?? Yes that's random, lol! I love trying new sports, but I'm not too great at them all the time. I go crazy for anything that involves dancing or water. Usually I've noticed that I'm more into sports for the actual physical feeling rather than winning. I can imagine that it must be nice to be in a team because you all get to work towards the shared goal and encourage each other.\n\nWith every activity I do though, I usually find that including another person that I know and sharing it with them makes it even more satisfying. When I enjoy doing something I try to teach it to my whole family and get them into it (especially anything physical) and they usually get annoyed. But when they enjoy it, it's all worth it!\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nEhh, I dunno how curious I really am. I like hearing gossip sometimes, but I wouldn't call myself a super curious person (I don't sit in my room wondering about space or something lmaooo)\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nYeah, I love that kinda stuff sometimes! I used to lead online groups. I tried to be very understanding and listened to all the members of the group and asked for everyone's opinion before doing stuff, and made sure I was being as kind and fair as possible. But I didn't tolerate rude people. I think I could be a bit too outgoing for some members at times.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nMy parents say I'm coordinated... But I'm not sure whether or not that's true. I find it hard to evaluate myself!\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nYeah, I LOVE art! I love creative writing, creating art with the computer, performance art, and music. Music is very important to me and there is always a song playing in my headphones or my head.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nHaha, that's kinda a weird question. I'm not really sure, but I'll try! If we're talking about past, my memories are generally pretty detailed for the recent past, but I don't remember long-term very well. And usually my memories are based on specific images, physical sensations, music, the people who were there... And just the general vibe. I can feel emotions from memories, but only if I'm already in that emotional state. I'm pretty focused on the present I guess, usually all I'm thinking about is where I'm going and the people around me, and fully enjoying and taking in everything. Future, not really quite sure... I don't plan long term because I don't know who I am or what I want. Things could change in an instant so I just try not to worry and only have a general plan of what I want. Still working on that... And constantly begging people around me for advice.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIt depends on what the thing is and who asks. Generally, I'm very open to helping out with stuff. I'm usually happy they thought of me as who they wanted to help, especially if I haven't know them for a while.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nSomewhat important? I like getting stuff done, but with other people, I am very patient.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nSometimes a little bit. I try to not be too overbearing, but if there's a group project and no one's doing anything, I sometimes have to be the one who manages everything. Lol. Or I try to get everyone to come and do something with me when not everyone's feeling it... But I try not to be like that, and respect when people don't have the energy for that. I'm trying to improve, that's one of the reasons I want to learn about MBTI! : )\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is definitely hands-on (kinesthetic) or visual. I can do very well when I am in a classroom with other people who expect me to concentrate and there are no distractions or more fun things to do. Me on online school is a whole other story... I've almost punched that screen many times and I feel the need to jump up and run laps when watching a lecture about math. In a classroom, however, I find that I can be completely still and very chill. (yo, I'm rhyming!) I used to struggle a lot when the learning environment is too unpredictable or chaotic (I would probably be more okay with it now) but usually I prefer it to be somewhat predictable with some surprises thrown in so it doesn't get boring. Also, I definitely prefer classes with creativity or physical senses. I can push through ones with memorization. But logic, I'm not very good at and it's hard for me to learn. I've always been terrible at coding, even when I wanted to learn. I'm not always great at puzzles either.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI actually really enjoy making to-do lists... It's one of my guilty pleasures. If it's an activity I enjoy, I will plan every detail and get hyped about it! If I don't enjoy it, then I usually don't plan it and just wing it. Also, I've found I do my best creative work on costumes and fashion when I'm under pressure and I don't make a plan. Most of the time I love to plan, but sometimes I enjoy myself more when I don't. Also, I love packing lists. I love getting all my stuff ready and being prepared. I love it when other people appreciate me being prepared and need my help, and I love it when I'm prepared for a situation and don't have to go out and buy something last minute because I already have it on hand!\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nThat's kinda a big question... I dunno, I just want to have fun and enjoy everything, and help as many people as possible.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nHmm, a lot of stuff I hate... But I'm trying to be less like that. Probably selfish people that don't care about anyone then deny everyone's suffering. Gatekeepers. Gaslighting. Not going to go much deeper because I try not to dwell on such things. But nothing makes me angrier than someone being a jerk then acting like they did nothing wrong. Or people getting framed for something they didn't do. Basically, I despise anything unfair.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nJust being super happy, usually after I talk to someone. Usually I express emotions physically, like flapping my hands or laughing and cheering! When I'm happy, I'm usually the most energetic person in my house.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nOh no, they're very bad... I just cry a ton and reach out to everyone I can for support. I know it's not great, but if I'm alone, it'll just get so much worse. I also try to get outside or do something active if at all possible and listen to music.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nFunny story, when I was younger I wanted to be known as the girl who always daydreamed and read etc. so I would try to force myself to daydream. It didn't work. I also have trouble with visualization because I'm very focused on what's happening around me. The only time I can daydream is at night when I'm getting ready to sleep, I'm still aware of my surroundings, but I can act out stories in my mind sometimes.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI would probably be super sad and wonder when I could get out, pace around, etc! That would drive me crazy.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nA long time. Especially if it's about my future. I can force myself to make a decision when there's pressure (like a deadline) otherwise, I will constantly ask everyone what I want. People don't give a clear answer, which I get, because they want me to do what I want to do, but I don't know what I want.  Then I sometimes delay the decision because I would rather focus on things that I don't have to think as hard about! Then the cycle of asking people for advice continues.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nEmotions are very important to me. Usually whatever I feel just spills out... I'm trying to get better about hiding my emotions. I'm definitely a crier when I'm upset, nonstop smiling when I'm happy... Not really sure what processing emotions is. They usually just spill out, and if I try to express them through other forms (like art or exercise) they actually get shoved down then I sometimes hold a grudge against people. Which very rarely happens to me when I express myself naturally. Usually I never hold grudges, because if the person is nice to me, I immediately forgive them (and get myself into bad situations...) It's just impossible to be rude to most people.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYeah, with people older than me, because I don't want to argue with them and I try to respect them. But if it's something I really care about, I will speak up. Especially if I feel that people are being inaccurately represented or being treated unfairly, or if someone will feel unwelcome or invalid if someone said this to them.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nIt depends on the rules. Generally I respect rules if they're for the safety of other people. But if I feel the rules are just there for people to exert power... I get mad. I try not to directly lash out, but I will find a way to quietly rebel or I will just stop going to the place that I feel has the unfair rules. Yes, I was always angry in school because many of the rules were insane and ridiculous, and I felt like I was the only one who cared!\n\nPS: With these test results, there might be a bias towards SE because I'm autistic apparently and I can be very... I dunno, sensory?? That might have skewed my results. Also, I found the language a little tough on the cognitive functions ones, particularly the ones that ask how you think, probably because I don't really take much note of how I think, I kinda just... Exist? Also, sorry for typing an essay! I tried to be as detailed as possible, but let me know if you want to know anything else.

How do you deal with them?\n\nPast: I can't forgive things from past but I don't really keep thinking about them tho. I just get angry when I remember things. \n\nPresent: Whenever I told myself to relax and live in the moment things sucked. But, I remember 3 close memories I was living in present. We had a picnic next to a fountain, I was on a little boat on the sea, and I was sitting on a beach. The common things are sun, sea-beach and being away from my family. \n\nFuture: I have always been future oriented and I've always comforted myself by thinking today doesn't matter if tomorrow is better.(But I agree this is not completely correct, I mean why do we even live then?) My family finds it annoying, my friends like it, other people think I don't have a life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\-If it doesn't hurt me then why would I help? I generally help if they don't want sth out of boundaries. People don't ask help from me tho. My friends constantly does for emotional support, which feels me like a hot guru so it's mutual. I don't believe anyone does anything just for the sake of making other people satisfied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\-I am a very emotional person but I always make logical decisions if it doesn't push me so bad. For example, there was a very good university+department opportunity for me and my teacher were telling me to choose it, but I didn't because I knew I would stop studying since I would be burned out by studying in a department I particulary dislike. I wouldn't go alive out of doing something I don't like for a long time. I at least need a interest for it. That's why I hated highschool, because of the classes I didn't have any interest in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\-If I am not going to be burned out at the end, I like to be efficent. I was studying 6-8 hours at the 12th grade. There had been times I only slept 4 hours(which was the dumbest decision I've ever made, dont do such things if you dont wanna get the memory of a goldfish at the and). I like efficieny+mental health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\-If I believe someone is bad, I will already see them wasted and use them as long as it doesn't make me bad. I know how shallow and toxic this sentence looks, but I just wanted to give my mindset honestly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\-I explained drawing, writing, reading in the former questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\-I can't learn if someone is teaching me. I have to sit on that table and learn in on my own. Here is what I do: Take your own notes, study them for days by separating the pages, then read them altogether. We are talking about sth long here, btw. I don't study for days for a 3 page thing. It's normal to do tho, don't feel bad if you do that, I am literally nobody to tell you that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\-How I strategy and plan: I want to get into xxx university, so I need to get this note from the exam, so I need to study these topics, so I need these books, so I must make everyone believe I will be succesful and get their money for the books. That was an example for education, but I always tend to plan things that way automatically in my head. \"There can't be other possibility than the xxx university or xxx career. If there is, this is not the life I planned. If this is not the life I planned, then why I am still here?\" Toxic shallow I know but this is the way I wanna live. I think everyone should live as how they wanna live and have the philosophy they want as long as they dont hurt other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What's important to you and why?\n\n\\-I think I should definetely answer this question but even when I'm talking to myself I feel so pathetic, so I can't open up about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your aspirations?\n\n\\-I don't feel safe for opening up about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\-Casually, to be kidnapped etc. but most real fear is stucking in a life I don't have a chance to get out of. I believe that I can be miserable until at the age of 89 but still can achieve my goal one month left to age of 90, but sometimes I am scared that whoever or whatever put us in this shithole will prove me wrong and I will give up.  Seeing other people be unsuccesful or pessimistic makes me doubt myself like that, even though my plans always go as however I wanted or better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I have many talents, my career will be good, I have a good friend, my favorite food is not that expensive so I can eat it often, I can understand things widely and from different aspects, I am objective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I don't think most people would love me if I would show them my true colors. I am scared that people will treat me as if I am something weird or bad. I've always tried to fit in the society and especially at past middle school-at the beginning of highschool I was trying to change myself. I thought I was not normal or mentally ill(I thought being introvert was a mental illness so I was constantly doing researches on how to be an extrovert) not because of that, but I just dont think someone who had a nice life with a good mental health would love me. I am not that good and I can only be that good while daydreaming. I am not saying my friends are murderers, I am just saying that they werent born with stars under their feet. I just like to watch those extra mentally healthy people as if they are angels. But no, we couldn't be together. I feel like a big bad stain in a white shirt around them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\-Daydream? Yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\-I have answered this question before for my book characters but I think I've never thought about myself. Honestly I would sleep. I don't think if I would think anything. Plus, why am I in a creepy room alone? I would be scared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\-Bad thing happens, I act like the end of the world has came literally for 5 minutes, I wipe my tears and make a new plan with the relaxation of a fresh cry session. I dont change my goal but I always try to make the path better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\-As I said before, I am a very emotional person. Emotions physically hurt me. I feel it in my body. But I like to sleep with the relaxation of crying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\-If it's for my own good or if I am in danger, yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n\\-I hate it when people break small harmless rules. Challanging authority, I can't think of a particular system for this. At first I was going to say it must be normalized more but what if one day people got a good authority and dumb people challange it? I should think of that more deeply. I don't like to share my thoughts before almost completely forming them.(Almost completely, because then I'll argue and reform them based on what I got from the other person)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\n\\-I won't share my opinions on this topic as I think my opinions might hurt other people and give them the wrong idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: If you know about other typology systems, you can make assumptions about them too.", "clean_guess": "ENTJ", "llm_guess": " ENTJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am 15 years old, female, I am really into debating social issues, I like discussing and talking with people. I like meeting new people even if I am really shy and awkward. I can be kind of funny at times, I like making people laugh. I like going out, I can be very talkative with friends and family. I am interested in music, art, and psychology. I am very analytical, I am independent, I have so many thoughts in my head I am scatterbrained lol. \n\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n\nNo, I haven\u2019t been diagnosed, however, I do show signs of mild depression. \n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI will say my childhood was pretty good. I don\u2019t really remember much about my childhood, but I don\u2019t think there was anything bad in it. The only thing I will say is that my parents, mainly my mom, were very critical and judgmental. I am only guessing this because I often feel like I can\u2019t express my own interests without feeling like I am cringe or weird. I was raised Mormon, my parents are still very active in the church. I remember when I was around 4 years old, I would go up to the pulpit and say my testimony. I got tons of compliments and remarks that I was a spiritual child. My parents would tell me how I had helped so many people that day and stuff. I felt good and I was known as the spiritual child of the bunch. However, this soon became more of a task. Now that I had people looking up to me, I felt like if I didn\u2019t go up to give my testimony then I would be disappointing tons of people and they would no longer see me as a spiritual person. Eventually, I did grow out of this religion. Just last year, I began questioning my own beliefs and I began disagreeing with some things in the Church, eventually, this led to me being a non believer. I told my parents I no longer believed, and they flipped. I have never felt so invalidated in my entire life. I felt ashamed for having different beliefs than they do. I did end up agreeing with them because I didn\u2019t want to fight anymore, and because I knew they weren\u2019t gonna leave me alone. So I just stopped trying since they weren\u2019t gonna hear me out. Despite all of this, I still love them. I won\u2019t say that they\u2019re bad people or bad parents, they\u2019re people who have flaws and I still appreciate them for what they\u2019ve given me. I truly value the time we have spent as a family. \n\n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don\u2019t have a job yet, however my dream job or career would be to work as a screenwriter or in the field of psychology. I would like to work in this because I find people interesting and I love learning about other people\u2019s experiences. I find the human mind interesting, I am always willing to learn of other\u2019s experiences. \n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would absolutely love this! I would feel very refreshed, I feel more like myself when I am home alone. I feel like I would get so much done on my own, I can do what I want to do, I want that kind of freedom where I don\u2019t have someone commenting on what I\u2019m doing and where I don\u2019t have to feel like I\u2019m gonna be judged.\n\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event, what is it? And why? If not, what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nI do like going outside though I don\u2019t really play sports. I sometimes play soccer. If I see someone playing, running, dancing, etc, I want to do that too. I might not be good at it, but I do like moving around. The only thing is that I want to do these things independently or with a group of people who are doing the same thing. Because otherwise it feels awkward. However I do also like exploring new places, for example visiting stores, going to new restaurants, car rides, etc. Stuff like that. I also really like going on roller coaster rides, I love the adrenaline. \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am a pretty curious person, I have more ideas than what I can execute. I feel like a lot of my ideas are based on what I observe, if I observe there is a problem that needs to be brought up then I will begin generating ideas to bring awareness to that problem or that situation ( Like writing a story about something I see me or others struggling with.) Though, very rarely do I execute them completely. I also get ideas based on thoughts that I have, sometimes I get ideas on something that has already been lurking in my mind. \n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI do not like being in a leadership position, I feel very awkward when being put in that position. Usually though, if I need to be in that position, I will first let the group brainstorm and then we choose the best idea or a combination of ideas, then I let them choose which part they want to work on and then pray to god that they do it. But I\u2019m not really so assertive either, I don\u2019t like telling people what to do, so I let them choose what part they want to work on. \n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI am not the best coordinated person, I am not really aware of my surroundings and sometimes it takes me a couple seconds to realize what happened. I do sometimes like working with my hands like making art, but more than anything I like doing intellectual things, like reading, writing, etc. It\u2019s hard for me to really just move around and do things. \n\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what \n* forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI am very artistic, I draw people, characters I like and have created. I am really into character design, I like expanding their backstory, personalities, style, and overall design. I am really into fashion as well, I like mixing and matching clothes and this can be apparent in my drawings and art as well. I often imagine and draw what my characters would wear and I draw it. \n\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI have a tendency to hold grudges against people and to hold onto the past, it\u2019s hard for me to forget, this also includes holding grudges against myself for things I regret doing. I might have happy moments that I look back on, but I also have tons of things that I regret. I will hold grudges if you did something to hurt me and if you didn\u2019t fix it. I look at the future, and I sometimes think \u201c Hm, this could happen because of xyz, and what am I gonna do about it? Well, I will deal with it when it gets here. \u201c I am pretty unsure of what the future holds, I can only guess where I am headed, and I will deal with the future when it gets here. I don\u2019t really think about the present either, I just go along with it as it throws things at me, I try to be adaptable. I observe and I think. I do try to change my present in order to be a better person like changing my habits and mindset, this is to prevent me from having a really bad future. \n\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI honestly feel awkward and uncomfortable when they ask for my help. Because, I don\u2019t really know how to help them. Especially if they ask for help on something that I don\u2019t really know how to explain, or if it\u2019s something subjective like art. Of course, I would still try to help them ( unless I have absolutely no idea what to do ), I would feel bad for not helping them, especially if I know a thing or two about what they need help with. And if I don\u2019t know what to do, I either leave like that or we try to figure it out together. \n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI feel like I do need logical consistency, all of my thoughts need to link to each other, I try to make sure that none of my thoughts have any contradictions to each other. I try to be consistent in what I say, practice, believe and say. They all need to line up perfectly.\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI feel like they\u2019re very important, but it\u2019s hard to do it. I try my best to be productive and I think it\u2019s a very important thing, I try to make lists and stuff to make sure I have some sort of idea on what I will be working on for that day.\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t really think I control others, it\u2019s more of me putting rules that work for myself. For example, when my siblings and I clean our room, I say that we each take turns cleaning our stuff. You clean your stuff and I clean mine. This way no one gets into arguments. While my siblings might not like this idea, to me this is what works. Otherwise, I don\u2019t really try to control anyone. I only set up standards and boundaries. They can do what they want I don\u2019t really care. \n\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMy hobbies are art, singing, dancing, and researching about topics I like. I like drawing because I find it really relaxing, it also helps me channel my creativity. I also am able to express myself through art, this goes the same for singing. I mainly use singing as not only a hobby but as a form of self expression, I look for songs that I relate to. I like dancing because 1: I need the workout and 2: because I feel like dancing when listening to a good song. I like researching things I like. I find it amusing and stimulating. I also research to know more about a topic or skill I am working on. \n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI don\u2019t know what category my learning style falls into, but I need someone explaining it to me in detail, and then I do it on my own. I need a one-on-one, where I can ask questions to understand the concept in full detail. I like this because I am not working with a group, it\u2019s me and this one person where I can have all my questions answered. I like classes that channel my creativity and analysis skills. I like classes that give me some sort of discussion I can have with people where we can exchange ideas. I like classes where there is no wrong answer, just you discussing what you learned from the novel you read, having debates about the novel, etc. \n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI need some sort of planning, I sometimes improvise, but I need to break down the project and make lists in order to make the tasks feel more manageable. I need to see them written down, if I let them linger in my mind I will either forget about it or I will be very stressed out. \n\n* What's important to you and why?\n\nI feel like my knowledge, mind, morals, and creations are very important to me. I value knowledge because I need it in order to do tons of things, I need my mind because it\u2019s the thing that helps think about all of these things. I value my morals because I want to be a good person, and I want to be genuine about it too. I value my creations because it\u2019s something I created, it\u2019s something I took the time to do, and especially if the final product looks really good. I do value family and friends as well. I value the time I spend with them. I love the discussions we have as well. \n\n* What are your aspirations?\n\nI strive to be a good person, because to me that\u2019s good, like being able to be open minded, more accepting, kind and loving. It\u2019s hard for me to be these things, but I do want to strive to be that kind of person that people can come to and feel comfortable around. I strive to be competent, I want to be good enough both as a person and in my creations. I want my work to be good enough that the public can truly value it.\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear rejection, I fear judgment. I often feel uncomfortable when I want to do something but the rest of the group doesn\u2019t want to. And now I feel like I have to go along with what they\u2019re doing. I am scared of standing out in a way, I would like to be a little different and do what I want to do but it\u2019s easier said than done. \n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nThe highs of my life look like when I complete a project and it turns out really good, when I am with my family and everything is ok and peaceful. This is when I feel really good about myself, my grades, my relationships, my hobbies, my knowledge.\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nThe lows of my life are when I am too attached to the past, I become very regretful, depressed, I isolate myself from everyone, I might be a little reckless. I might become very critical of both myself and others. I might be more angry and irritated, and it\u2019s not the best feeling ever. There is a ton of confusion, regret, shame, blame, etc. \n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI do daydream a lot, this is mainly when I am bored or when I have time alone to do so. If I am focused on a task, I try to not lose focus of it. However, if I have music on ( Like right now lol ), I will most likely daydream. I daydream about scenes for my stories, dance choreographies, literal music videos, etc. \n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about it?\n\nI would probably think about how cool or weird the room is. I might begin planning out my novel, my career, I might make jokes about myself or the room. These thoughts would probably spiral into a bunch of different things. One thing leading to another, until I am probably remembering one of my most sad/happy moments in life. During this time I will probably do tons of self reflection about my life, my choices, etc. \n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI take a long time to make a decision. I need time to think about it, I need time to consider the pros and cons. I don\u2019t want to feel rushed when making an important decision. After I make the decisions, I will either feel very uncertain or very sure of myself. I might end up changing my mind later though. \n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nIt takes a while to let out my emotions, I need to release them when I am alone, it\u2019s hard to express emotion around others. So I take the time for self reflection to cry and process my thoughts and feelings on the matter. I would say my emotions are important, I let myself feel things, but it\u2019s still very hard to talk about with someone. So I let it out by myself. \n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI sometimes do. If I am bullshitting my way through the conversation I will probably agree with them. This is also true if I know that my thoughts won\u2019t be appreciated or if the person won\u2019t take it well, then I agree with them just for the sake of not starting anything. Like when my parents talk to me about their religion and beliefs, I will agree with them. Even if I think differently because I know they won\u2019t take it well. However, if I am with a group of open minded people, I will say what I think needs to be said. \n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nI do break rules often when I think that the rules are stupid. If the authoritative figure is being a rude, unreasonable, ignorant, terrible person, or if the rules are straight up bs, I will not follow the rules. Sometimes I will even feel the need to go against the rules. If they tell me not to do something, I will feel like doing the opposite. Whether I do it is up to me and if I find it worth doing.  \n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nMy ideal life would probably be accomplishing what you were wanting to accomplish. Being who you were striving to be, living in your ideal house, with your ideal people. Living the ideal life for me means that you at least made an impact in the world somewhere out there.

{"submission": "Hello. As the title reads, need some help figuring myself out.

{"submission": " \n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general discription of yourself.\n\nI'm a 31F. I'm easygoing and maybe a little high strung as well. I respect people and hope they choose to respect me in return at least. I'm shy and prefer to spend my time with my partner and our daughter at home instead of out on the town. Although I did used to frequent a karaoke bar after going on a blind date there in the past, and if I felt like driving and had the time, I'd probably still attend (and also if it weren't for Covid). I'm spiritual and believe we are all interconnected souls on this fortunate rock going round the Sun. I don't know or understand myself too much even at 31, but that may be because I had a traumatic childhood and never got the chance to truly explore myself like every child should. \n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nYes, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and have had mental health issues since I was young.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nYes, I was forced to go to a Christian church and do Christian activities. I went with my grandmother's flow and participated in everything with a smile on my face. For a while there I even believed that what the church was saying was true and stayed a Christian for a majority of my young adulthood. I began questioning it in my late twenties but just went with another religion. It wasn't until I met my now partner and he showed me the way, that I decided religion wasn't for me. Oh, and the reason I followed the rules so sharply is because I don't like to stir the pot for one, and also I was scared of the notion of hell. I believed it was real and it haunted me and my choices for a long time.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI'm a Home Health Aide right now and it has it's pros and cons. I like it because I like the elderly and helping them out brings me good vibes. I also feel like I\"ll be elderly one day and I want to put good karma out there in the world. The cons of it are I hate cleaning, and I hate the feeling of being responsible for something as significant as a person all by myself. I was a CNA and I enjoyed that work much more because I was on a team. I much rather work on a team than by myself, whether that's two people or ten.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI'd be very lonely. I'm sure I'd find something to kill the time, but I like to spend my time with my significant other and our daughter. I can be alone but it's not as fun as when I'm with others.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like going to paint and sips. I like visiting parks, taking in the atmosphere on walks, and taking photos of the nature. I like watching nostalgic TV shows or new TV shows that catch my attention and movies I like. I also like to listen to music and I love karaoke. I haven't played any sports in years and I don't mind playing them. I like to go fishing but I don't know much about it and would need to go with someone more experienced.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm moderately curious. I'm always asking questions. No, I barely have any ideas lol. My curiosities are about life after death, history, psychology, understanding the state of the world, news, politics. But I doubt I'll ever understand it.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo I would not enjoy taking on a leadership position. Well... maybe in the future when I'm more confident in my capabilities. You have to have knowledge, wisdom and insight to be a leader. I don't currently have enough of those things. I probably should just stay in a follower position. \n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI don't know.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI would like to be artistic but I don't know how to generate creativity. I was interested in becoming an artist but gave up because I was dedicated enough to learn the craft.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past is in the past for a reason. Take what you can and learn and grow from it. It's important to enjoy the present as it comes and goes. Planning for the future is a good idea but its wise to understand that it's unpredictable and it may not always go as planned.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI'm very lazy so I usually internally don't feel like helping, but I know it's important to help others so I do. They don't see that I'm reluctant. I do well to hide how I truly feel about it and do it because we should help each other.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nNo, I don't even know what that is.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nEh, it doesn't make too much of a difference to me. It has it's place and it can be annoying if I\"m the only one being efficient and productive. But I'm probably going to get over it the second  I'm finished with the task.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nMaybe at times, but not always purposefully. The only recent examply that comes to mind is I was almost let go of a company for not responding to my boss's texts. I text her purposefully so that I could keep my job. If that's not controlling then I guess I don't really do it. If I do (unknowingly), I don't see it that way. I just go with the flow in each day as it comes, and that includes how I interact with others.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI don't really have any hobbies right now. In the past I used to sketch, take photos, go for walks to the park. Now all I do is spend time with my family and watch TV shows or movies and listen to music. Oh, I would like to start baking and cooking more recipes.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI learn best through hands on, practical application. Whether that's being trained how to cook something, or taking notes and tests many times. That's my best learning style. I don't learn auditorily or by seeing something. I guess I'm a more kinesthetic learner.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'm not great at it. I have to go to my partner and ask him his advice for many a thing.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI just want to find the one thing I'm good at, perfect it and move on to the next. I want to discover my purpose for being here on Earth and do what I can to fulfill my soul mission this time around. Realistically speaking, that looks like finding the right job, or find the right training program or program to study. I don't know what all it will take to get there but Im willing to go the distance.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy main fear is losing my partner somehow. I know I have a daughter to worry about too, but I feel like she has her life ahead of her, and I do worry about losing her sometimes too. What makes me uncomfortable is when I'm expected to attend social events I rather not go to. People make me uncomfortable. Being in the spotlight makes me uncomfortable. I hate division in society and corrupt world leaders, because they're ruining life for the rest of us.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nGetting in Gifted and Talented program (a program for highly intelligent children) in the fifth grade, winning a art contest where we were all given the same coloring page and it just needed to be colored in, in the first grade I think\n\nGraduating from high school (18), then CNA school (22).\n\nGetting my own apartment, even if it was with some help at age 23.\n\nMeeting my partner (26)\n\nHaving my daughter (29)\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nMoving around a lot in my teens\n\nmental hospital stays\n\nsleeping with someone's partner\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI'm a good chunk attached to reality. But I do have moments where I think about other stuff and it holds my attention over what's right in front of me. Especially while driving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI don't know, really. could be anything. Maybe wonder what my partner is doing at home. Or I think about the future. Usually what's right in front of me starts the thought box ticking.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt would take forever if it weren't for my partner's help sometimes. Yes I've changed my mind plenty of times.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI usually process my emotions in the moment, then reflect on it later, extensively. I'm a pretty emotionally cool person but I appreciate emotions. They aren't super important, I just see them just as important as food and water. It's important to feel things and understand why we do feel them the way we do. It's also super important to express them. But I don't push these things.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes, all the time. I don't want to cause a rift, so I just let people say their thing. I don't necessarily agree with them, but I will do a polite smile and listen. And it's because I don't like conflict. I rather we all get along and getting along doesn't always equal agreeing.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nSometimes I do speed but I think I have a lead foot. I think rules are meant to be broken. But they're also there for a reason. So I try not to break the rules and be a good little member of society. But every now and again I may harmlessly break a rule or two. I don't know much about challenging authority. I don't really care. I break rules for the feeling of freedom from it. Rules can be so constraining. But I would never hurt anyone and always make sure my rule breaking doesn't hurt anyone. If it's harmless, then there's no harm in it, right?\n\nThank you if you decided to take the time to read all this. I feel like a wrote a mini book about myself lol.

{"submission": "I always mix up the functions, so I'm hoping to find some clarificaiton here! Please help me figure out what functions these characteristics fall under.\n\n1. I prefer to explore and try something out myself instead of searching for tutorials or how-to's. For example, I tend to try out a lot of projects, whether it be costume making, art, video making, etc. and I always prefer to try it out myself because sitting through a tutorial is frustrating to me. Only after I've explored it, tried it out, and got stuck do I look up tutorials. If i don't get stuck, then I never look up the tutorial and keep doing what I'm doing. (I'm assuming Ne here, but I'll still ask for clarification/if it fits into any other function)\n2. Working with my hands grounds me. I have some anxiety, but making things with my hands puts me in a meditation state and keeps me in the present. I love it.\n3. I like being silly. I even use coffee as a pick me up sometimes because it gives me the energy I enjoy having. I'm not sure how to describe this, as bad as the connotations are for this word, I'd descrive it as being quirky (that word has so many bad things attached to it, apologies for not finding a better descriptor). I like making jokes of things and having fun in everyday situations. (I was also a former theater kid, but I have no more time for it these days) - (idk if this can be tied to any specific function)\n4. I really enjoy being with people. I have to admit, I can be very **VERY shy,** but once I get comfortable, I really enjoy the experience of being with another person/people. I like interacting with them, learning about them, and getting their reactions. (probably Fe, but again, looking for clarification/if something else).\n5. I'm pretty competitive. The one thing that can get me out of a rut is getting pissed off that someone that I see as competition is better than me. It gets me pissed af.\n6. I like pushing myself to try new things. When I think of my life's purpose, yes I have goals like graduating college and making money and getting married and having a family, but a huge part of my philosophy is just being able to experience as much as possible. I think this stems from my childhood. I was very overprotected and sheltered as a kid and its only made me want to explore as much as possible to make up for that and as a form of revenge.\n7. I care a lot. I care a lot about other people and feel a lot of compassion when I learn about other people's stories. For example, I do math tutoring for kids and one student is new to the country and despite all the political things we could say about this, I know she's just a kid and it's not her fault at all, so I try my best to check up on her, talk to her, and keep her on track. When I was younger my empathy was definitely out of wack, but I've learned to control it (as in, not have empathy for everyone because not everyone deserves it or your help). I got hurt a lot when I was younger because of it, but I've learnt from it.\n8. I have big aspirations. I've always seen myself as someone with an unreasonable amount of hope for the possibilities of the future. The downside is that I don't always know how I'll get there. I have the goal, but don't always have the plan.\n\nI think I've narrowed down my mbti to enfp/entp, but again I'm pretty bad at distinguishing cognitive functions from each other, so I'm looking for help! (I'm a female and 19 if that helps btw.)\n\nEven when I do figure out my mbti, I think I'll use it as a way to relate to people but I don't want to use it as a box to limit myself. I've made that decision clear with myself because I can see how mbti can become harmful to someone if it becomes their entire identity.", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "1. How do you make decisions?\n\nI make decisions by weighing in what will be the best long term solution. I'm happy to make a decision that involves sacrificing something for the greater good. Generally I make decisions on what makes sense to me, and I enjoy making decisions so I actively choose to make lots of decisions when working in a group. base my morals on the most obiective form of logic, therefore my own learned/personal morals don't interfere with my decisions. I usually disregard my own and other's emotions when making an important decision.\n\n2. How do you deal with your emotions?\nI honestly wallow in my emotions for long enough for them to numb away. I often withdraw myself if I\u2019m in a stressful situation and get to a place where I can feel safe enough to process what happened.\n\n3. What drives you in life? What do you look for?\n\nAchievement and knowledge drives me in I*\nWhen I look at my life in the long run, I want to have achieved as much as I could have and left as big of a mark on the world as I could have.\nAcquiring knowledge is what drives me short term, I greatly enjoy learning and perfecting my beliefs with the new knowledge/data I receive.\n\n4. How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI am better at planning than executing my ideas. I do like to plan a schedule on who is going to do what task, what will happen when, etc. If I don't do that, l'll often feel lost and give up and move on to something new.\n\n5. What do you hope to accomplish in your life?\n\nSince I'm only a teenager, my hopes and aspirations aren't set in stone just yet. Ideally, I want to have felt like I've balanced personal enjoyment (my hobbies) and the feeling that I have achieved something great, like fame or making some extraordinary discover in my field for example.\n\n6. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about?\n\nI'm very curious. I often have a lot of plans that lend up lacking the motivation to go throu with. I'm often going through bouts of constant brainstorming, to only feel like I have complete creative block the next dav. Mv curiosities often lie beyond the unknown. I love speculating on something like extraterrestrial life to the plot of what a next sequel of a game/ movie might be about. Basically anything that I don't have an affirmative of knowing for certain.\n\n7. What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally, I aspire to have mastered knowledge in my field and made an extraordinary discovery that has garnered me fame. Personally, I want to feel as if l've gained as much wisdom as I've thought possible. I also want to have children to have peace of mind that l've continued my own genetic line.\n\n8. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nMy opinion of the past is bittersweet. For me, personally, I feel my past has been a tough lesson to make me who I am today. Often reflecting on it is interesting but it can make me feel sad and bring me back to how I felt when times were worse. The present focuses on acquiring comfort and safety for me. When focusing on the present, I want to feel like I'm in control over what's going on. That's why I plan in advance and acquire as much info a possible about future events. The future is V most fascinating time period for me. It focuses on possibility and escapism. When in a bad mental state, I fixate on the future too much - constantly imagining unpleasent as well unrealistic events to happen to me.\n\n9. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is a mix of auditory and visual. I really dislike learning in a place with too many sounds or social distractions. I need a place to completely hyperfixate on what l'm doing with interruption. I'm very concentrated and efficient when in that kind of state. A good blend of creativity and logic is the most interesting topic in my opinion. I like exploring abstract topics like philosophy and stuff related.", "clean_guess": "INTJ", "llm_guess": " INTJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "- 21, Male, Data Analyst, single\n- I had diagnosed depression and anxiety several years ago, but I can say now that I\u2019m mentally relatively stable\n- My family were and are Muslims, not radical, but still very much traditional. The thing that I might remember from my upbringing related to this is that they acted like what is wrong or what is right is predetermined and they put labels on things that they did not even know well about, which kind of made me mad, since I used to read a lot as a child and it was interesting why so many people followed this religion, and I did not want to do it solely owing to my environment. Also, they used to debunk my logical arguments only because I was a kid.\n- I like my job as a Data Analyst, since it lets me utilise my talents of trying to find answers to questions and I'm good with numbers and maths, and working from home is the best because you can build your own routine to follow, which is much more convenient than commuting to work and having to physically work with people (I hate small talks at offices)\n- I think I would feel kinda lonely because I work from home all weekdays and I also need socialisation and I love my friends. \n- Out of physical sports, I play ping pong and, occasionally, football (soccer). Also, I love walking by myself listening to music.\n- I have a lot of ideas in my mind and they always spring up randomly, especially in terms of coding and music. For the first criterion, I guess I could refer to automatisation and optimisation as an example. As a part of my job, I often offer my Senior developer (I'm Middle) ideas such as new algorithms for working with unstructured data and many more. When it comes to music, it's like there always are notes playing in my head and every minute there's a new melody. I always try to capture this melody and then execute it on an instrument and/or my computer. Moreover, I always try to learn new things and I watch videos related to my sphere of work, various theories/concepts and also about psychology, since I'm interested to know more about myself and how I can become a better person all-around.\n- I don\u2019t particularly enjoy being or even want to be a leader, but if necessary, I always try to guide people on what I think would be the best possible outcome for my team.\n- I\u2019m normally coordinated aside from daydreaming and doing things on autopilot (I\u2019m rarely coordinated in these cases, except when I\u2019m playing an instrument)\n- I feel appreciated and I will gladly help them, but only if I ever think that they would also help me if needed.\n- I can\u2019t imagine my life without logical consistency, except when it comes to relationships with people, since it doesn\u2019t always rely on logic alone.\n- Efficiency and productivity are always on the top of my priority list.\n- Well, if I try to control others, I would like to do it either through other people\u2019s influence, or by changing my attitude towards them.\n- My primary hobbies are related to music and gaming (RPG, competitive FPS). I play guitar, piano and drums (drums not so much). Also, music production and writing lyrics could also be considered as my interests.\n- I think my learning style is more auditorial, since my hearing memory is quite well-developed. I can remember almost anything I hear, whether it be musical pitch-related or simply conversations including information. With other types of learning, I think I\u2019m pretty good at creative classes, since I have fun while learning something in an unorthodox way, but with the remaining learning types, I will need to experience them multiple times to memorise.\n- I usually have not too many projects at work, and I like to break them up to smaller tasks, which makes it easier to track my progress.\n- A blank room is nice.\n- I think a lot before making important decisions and only make it after considering all the possible outcomes and when I\u2019m sure my desired one is the most probable of them all.\n- I process my emotions pretty fast, if it\u2019s not about love. If it is, then I tend to meticulously plan everything I need to do to win over the person I\u2019m interested in. Emotions are, of course, important, but I hate it when people are so emotional that they do not realise their flawed decision-making, then tell me I\u2019ve been right all along.\n- If I have any counterarguments, I\u2019ll gladly share them with the other person. I also don\u2019t like when people agree with each other just to please others.\n- Rules are made to look for a meaning. If they have no underlying purpose, then this rule can be broken.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "General description: female high school upperclassman, Asian-American. May have ADHD (pursuing diagnosis but wait times are atrocious)\n\nUpbringing: Asian-American household with immigrant parents. No religious influence (I'm agnostic). Oldest child of two, parents had to do some trial-and-error with me. In middle school I would get in a lot of trouble for things like not turning in my homework (I could do the work I just didn't) and breaking rules (brought gum to school) and not following directions (couldn't hear when my teachers called for me to put my book down, and then when I did hear I'd go \"oh just one more page\") --- currently a straight-A student\n\nIdeal weekend (changed the suggested prompt a little): sleep until 10am, then get up and eat a nice light breakfast. I'd stay at home and crochet, read, watch a movie or show, and interact with people via Gamepigeon, chess.com, or text. Might bake something, might call my boyfriend. I'd probably have earbuds in most of the time. On one of the two days I might go and do a social activity with close friends or hang out with my boyfriend, though that'd probably be on Saturday because I need Sunday to recover from said social activity, during which I'd be sustaining myself with sugar and that mild insanity when you're really tired but with people you like\n\nActivities I prefer: I enjoy solo sports and am pretty good in the water. I hate anything involving catching and throwing balls since I have no eye-hand coordination or reaction time and managed to get a concussion in PE class during our frisbee unit. Did ballet for a while and really enjoyed that.\nI love writing, and recently picked up crocheting because of how meditative it is (and useful for gift-giving)\n\nCuriosity: I like to think I'm fairly curious. I enjoy a good puzzle and \"inventing\" things: I never finished learning the Rubix Cube because I insisted on creating my own algorithm, which got me 2/3 of the way through. Hated memorizing other people's algorithms\n\n\nLeadership: I like taking charge of and coordinating projects that already have some objective and a group of people, like a school project. I don't like taking charge from the get-go, though I can if nobody else is willing.\n\nCoordination: I love working with my hands and moving my body, but I cannot catch/throw things or do things that traditionally test your eye-hand coordination.\n\nArtistic-ness: I love creating and designing things like crochet projects or ceramic vases, but I'm not the most artistically talented.\n\nLearning style: I have recently discovered that I absolutely thrive in a discussion-based classroom environment where there's debate, argument, discussion, a challenging and potentially changing of opinions, and some competition. I can't learn math, for example, by sitting and listening to the teacher talk and then sitting and doing classwork. I have to try out the concept as it's being taught, ask questions, and then stand at a whiteboard and collaboratively apply concepts with my peers.\n\nAdditional comments: I\u2019ve gotten test results for INFP and INTP. I\u2019m a very day-dreamy person, which makes me think INFP. However, my friend has very accurately described my taste in s/os as tall nerd, and I really do enjoy debating people, especially when my own stance changes a little.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? \n\nExtremely religious and structured and as a kid I was very religious to the point of superstitions ,where I used to believe certain rituals will bring good things and certain will bring bad things, but as I reached teens I started questioning everything to the point of getting anxiety for example as a teen when I started to question many religious things but this also made me anxious as I am not following rituals so I was afraid something bad will happen and despite my anxieties I still questioned everything in my mind and as I aged I got over such anxieties and I formed my own religious code, which I believe in, but still such code is always changed depending on my observations through life. So yeah its not fixed in nature\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? \n\nAt present Im unemployed \u2639 but I want to do a job that gives me maximum freedom and I don\u2019t want to subordinate myself to others , and wherever I go I have this urge to get to the top. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n\nVery refreshed but I don\u2019t mind if someone plans a trip or something , either way I love it , I mean if someone wants me to meet and chill then yeah I will go and enjoy and if I have to stay alone that too fine as long as I\u2019m not bored, in which case I just sleep through entire weekend\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI prefer videogames, and also im not good at sports , i mean , i enjoy outdoor games very much but i get exhausted easily, i have strong desire and spirit to play every physical game like basketball,football etc but my body just gives up instantly. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you?

Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNot interested but I am very good at leadership, my leadership style would be taking opinions of others and combining them to generate a solution to solve the problem at hand, and I also I wont let others to control me at their will, I stand my ground firmly, I take opinions but I wont easily swayed by them\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? \n\nIm excellently coordinated when im in a fight or when im angry but in all the other times I am a bit clumsy, I only enjoy playing videogames with my hands\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy.

How do you deal with them? \n\nPast is shit, present is the time I can make most of it so yeah I wont waste present , future is idk I have a goal that I want to achieve but other than that goal I don\u2019t care much about it I want to realize that goal so I\u2019m putting my maximum effort in present \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? \n\nI say no at first without a second thought but if they are messing things up and are really incompetent in solving their problem and if it lead to to terrible consequences then I will take charge and lead them towards the solution. This happens all the time, everywhere I go people ask me help, I reject, they mess up and are afraid to act, I take charge, I will solve their problem. I wish I could get rid of this habit of me, this habit is eating away my inner peace. People who take my help are better than me whereas I am always on the losing end because I help them. My helping nature is my curse \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life? \n\nIn life? Idk but when I am solving a technical problem or any other problem? Then definitely yes, without logical consistency one cannot find perfect solution\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery much, I used to always working on something to not waste time to achieve my goal, but recently I am physically tired to do anything I am very much distracted by everything around me , feeling lazy etc. idk what happened to me but last 2-3 months were my lazy period before that I used to be very active.

What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? \n\nMy learning style involves complete in detailed understanding of concept without any inconsistency\n\nThe environment where people rote memorized everything to get marks and where logical understanding of subject was heavily reprimanded. I suffered a lot in such environments\n\nFuck memorization , I value logic , creativity and yes physical experiences too\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? \n\nI suck at strategizing, I plan and schedule everything in my mind but I wont follow it and I will do things whenever I feel like to do but once I start working on something nothing can deter me from completing the task, also I am extremely good at improvising\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally? \n\nProfessionally , To be as free as possible and to maintain my personal autonomy, but personally I wish I have someone to whom I can show my vulnerable side and I wish I have someone who wont betray me no matter what, in simpler terms I want a loyal partner to whom I can be vulnerable and who wont take advantage of me, and I want someone to love me for being myself not my money,status etc . I want them to accept all parts of my personality and tell me genuinely without malicious intentions where I am doing wrong in life \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable?

In fact, there are many times in which I won against impossible odds\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like? \n\nLows are times where I cant achieve anything I have set myself to and I am leading a mediocre life, and where it seems everything I do ends up in failures.

If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? \n\nI understand how reality works, I daydream when someone is speaking and i may cant even hear what they are speaking and I daydream when I am alone, but I am extremely hyperaware of my surroundings, my friends literally call me daredevil (marvel character) because they think I have heightened sense and can quickly react to whatever happening in my surroundings \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? \n\nI sleep ,or I may daydream myself to death, imagine a beautiful stories XD\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? \n\nVery long and yes I might change the decision but in emergencies I quicly take decisions and act upon them but I suck at taking decisions involving my career, education and other such stuff. Except in urgent matters I cant take decision in other matters\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? \n\nI want to sort them out but I see that as wastage of time , emotions are important to me and sometimes Idk I unknowingly cry myself to sleep , they come and go as they please when I am alone and when I am with people I express emotions  without restraint except crying because crying infront of others make me feel weak\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? \n\nI agree with others to not cause unnecessary arguments, conflicts and yes I might keep conversation going so as to not hurt them and to not make unnecessary enemies that might backstab me in future but if someone crosses their limits and tries to break into my territory or takes advantage of my nice and calm demeanour then I will kick their butt and put them in their place. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why? \n\nI fricking hate rules, I always want to challenge authority and sometimes fantasize seizing authority and becoming a powerful person that is not bound by any rules or regulations. Rules always seem to restrict me from doing what I want. I respect rules only if they deliver justice to the people in need but I hate rules when they make good people to suffer.

{"submission": " \n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n   * Male, 27. I am a person who does not cry at death, whatsoever. I do love those whom passed but I feel nothing about it. I want to do something amazing, and spectacular, I don't know how to start. I love only 2 people, that is all. I don't believe in love except for extreme liking of someone to a point of it being categorized. I am objective, however I am not myself to anybody, my inner self is a different person entirely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n   * I don't know. I have anxiety of weird things, I was young and watched Bambi and found him to be so cute I wanted to legitimately murder him and his mother for the sake of their suffering. It made me so... spiral inside I guess would say. Like the phrase \"So cute I can just kill you and watch your mother suffer, or her and see you suffer.\" This was in my early childhood and I eventually grew out of it, but it was a passion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n   * I was raised good. Loving parents, sibling was older, however I felt my duty to make sure he never had to have any want of anything, I did all and would do all for that man. It's my Brother. The only man I love. I loved my daddy, but he dead. I felt nothing, I slept in bed with him until aged 17. He was what a \"Man\" was. Period. I suffered for my brother, and it was not good for me, I believe it killed me inside emotionally. As in dead, no emotions. Yes religion was always in the knowing while growing up, but once the 2011's and whatnot happened it became strong in my mother, and I was following suit out of fear of god. This fear inspired me to find proof of his not-being.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n   * I'm a salesman for my sins, but I have trouble holding a job. I am good at what I do, I was best salesman in my state 50 years over. I don't like the fact I 'HAVE' to do something. I don't like being told what to do by any structure, or boss, and I want to lead others. I would honestly love being a Leader of a structured grouping, that I alone led. I never slack when I work, I put all effort in. Until I don't like the company anymore, then I take risks and don't care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n   * I enjoy my alone time. However, I want to go and achieve something very wonderful in line with my plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n   * I enjoy to shoot guns and practice my aim. However, whatever I do I do it 110% I cut my lawn with a knife once. Mower was outta gas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n   * Yes. Very. That's what my problem is, I want to go lead these people of picking, as it were, but I don't know how to start. I wish I was born in an early time, or in someplace of anarchy where I could do as I please. It would come easy, the burden of family and my love for them being the only thing stopping me from my true inner goals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n   * Yes. I want only me to, I feel I can do it better and I am no follower. Never. I would be fantastic at it. I have built the strategy for it for the last 12 years in my mind. I would be a ruler who is loved and respected, and feared but not of your life from me. Loved and Respected first. They would not want to disappoint and upset me for their love respect would be why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n   * Yes, I do. I enjoy meditation of topics and concepts. I am coordinated, but only in my mind. Not in my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n   * I was always good with drawing, I tried to paint, I did a few and didn't keep pursuing as I ran out of money for supplies. I like to capture life in a snapshot. I want to make paintings and series of average streets and common local's but in a war-torn fashion. As if war brought to home. Bird's eye. I never made them, but want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n   * The past makes me sad. I don't like thinking about childhood and I don't like looking at pics or videos of my childhood. It upsets me. Present is how I live. Always. Future I have goals I mentioned but I am stuck in the present and when that changes, I don't like it. Anxiety ensues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n   * It depends. If it's someone I like, I help them. If it's someone I can't stand, but still like, I won't. I don't suffer what I don't want to suffer. So that I can interject into their zeitgeist myself and project an image of someone who can be admired and followed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n   * I don't reckon so. Thinking about it. I am a very logical thinker and I conversate in logics, to the point of taking over conversations with my words, and compounding each topic into a tangent. I am very particular with my words, and I am great at doing that. Speaking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n   * It's very important. What use is something that is not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n   * I don't try to, but I am aware, like what I listed above. Amongst other things, It's not a sick game to me, it's just sometimes the thing I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n   * I enjoy meditating on interesting topics. I study biblical and religious texts. Weapons I know a lot about and have a love for. I enjoy talking about the concept of things that are unique, and like.. afterlife concepts, the idea of forms like the philosophic topic, things of that nature. My other hobbies is learning all I can about a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n   * I prefer to learn by observing others in case of Leadership, and combining the good and observing where my idol leaders fall short also. Then make my learning out of that. With other things, I prefer to have descriptive very descriptive tellings. Images can help, but aren't necessary at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n   * If I care about it I make a plan and do what is efficient and necessary. Whether it be nice or not. If I don't care, I wing it and just go as I do. I can do both well. I ruminate on my interested projects however.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What's important to you and why?\n   * Loyalty. It is the foundation of everything. You must be able to trust what is being relayed to you. \n   * Trust. Trust must be laid as a foundation however I trust no one truly, because it's foolish to think that someone is not out for what they want.\n   * My family's health. My family is first in all things.\n   * Understanding of things accurately, and the assurance of people to know I will not misconstrue them. Trusting me is a promise I give, by example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your aspirations?\n   * To lead an organization of my own making, with people made from my own pickings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n   * I hate people who challenge me for what reason but to do it? Insecurity shines bright in them. \n   * I do not enjoy introspection. I hate it. I would kill myself if everyday was me knowing my effect on others. Thankfully it's rare.\n   * I hate disrespect.\n   * I hate lies. I want it said straight. I cannot stand someone who dances around something. Just say it. I do not need to be played with by someone not sure of their words and the audacity to lie to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n   * I don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n   * Bad. Drug induced paranoia. A relationship made from lust and built with bricks of delusion and mud of mistrust.\n   * I hate it when my family the two I love are done harm by my actions, even if it is not my intention. It is NEVER my intention. I hate the man I see in the mirror staring back. He's a pathetic excuse of a person getting by parasitically and don't deserve the strife I give out without attempt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n   * I'm always aware of what I'm doing. However the effects of my doings I am acutely unaware of. Thankfully, otherwise like I said I couldn't bare to live.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n   * I just sit, consider my plans for future endeavors. \n   * How I can make this moment better than it already is, if sober.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?'\n   * If it comes to my family? I consult and I don't want to condemn them by a choice I make\n   * If it's a plan of my own doing with my own machinations, I am very decisive and I trust what I do is best. I know it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n   * I feel empty inside and emotions aren't a good feeling, cause it's something like a epiphany of my debauchery. \n   * Euphoria and nothing else is my most important emotion.\n   * Wonder and Pondering is my other most important emotion.\n   * I\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n   * With my family I am kind, but honest.\n   * With strangers I am a chameleon. It's easy because they are of no consequence.\n   * With people I see under my following, I am blunt and to the point, I will not make them harsh feelings with emotional words, but corrective talking and loving guidance as it were, basically. It's complicated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n   * Authority is usually the corrupter of men and the result of our ancestors making the mistake of subjugating their own lives simply for the temporary gain.\n   * If my method was followed from step one of mens beginnings, If I were to be the guiding force, there wouldn't be authority to corrupt and make people glorified serfs under delusional other serfs drunk on imaginary power they were given by the ones with ambition to take lead. Even their authority is nothing but an illusion by which humanity is innately flawed and ruined from conception.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n   * No government, no authority, or civilization. Every man for himself, to do what he wants, and the ones who can't will have protection from the malefactors of our people, by the people brave enough to sacrifice for them and create a leadership and guidance for their protection and safety in return for protection and love. That's how it should be.\n   * If this is about MY life? To be the shepherd leading the flock of the weak and making them into strong people. To raise them up in my guidance and attentive nurture.

{"submission": "Description: I\u2019m an 18-year-old male. I am generally quiet and observant around strangers and usually avoid social gatherings, but around family or close friends, I can be rather talkative and energetic. Still, I listen more than I speak in every conversation. My parents have always been supportive, empathetic, and lenient. I enjoy listening to, playing, and writing music. Music is beautiful to me, and it makes me happier and more inspired than anything else. I also love learning languages (especially Spanish), as I really like to break barriers in communication and to discover other cultures and identities. If I had to spend an entire weekend by myself, I would feel great and refreshed. I very seldom spend my weekends with other people anyway. I am a perfectionist in virtually everything that I work on, whether the project/task is significant or not. I tend to have a time-consuming, meticulous and methodical work style, yet I am inclined to procrastinate. I am attracted to intelligence, being down-to-earth, and sensitivity in people; however, I dislike seeing when people are fake, unkind, or ignorant.\n\nI took the 16personalities test as well as the Humanmetrics Jung Typology Test, and both told me I was INFJ, and I very much related to descriptions of INFJ, so I was fairly confident that was my personality type. However, after hearing the former is a popular yet inaccurate test and that taking the cognitive functions into consideration would be more helpful, I decided to take a couple tests regarding cognitive functions. \n\nThe IDRlabs test said my Introverted Sensing was most prominent, which would make me likely an ISFJ or ISTJ, which was surprising. I\u2019m not sure what most of the Sakinorva test results mean. I noticed Si was not even in my top 3 most prominent functions this time. Can anyone suggest what my type might be based on these results and my description? Thank you.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}

I don\u2019t enjoy it since I\u2019m very squeamish and physically weak, but I refuse to quit or get another job until I\u2019ve worked there for at least a year since I don\u2019t want the fact I quit a job before a year passed on my resume. I picked busser because I wanted to avoid forced social interaction, but honestly, looking back, I prefer forced social interaction now.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\nDepends on what the previous week was like, but most likely lonely. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\nI enjoy doing art, researching, and playing video games. I do not like nor am I good at sports. \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\nI consider myself pretty curious and have more ideas than I can ever execute. I don\u2019t really have a pinpoint on what interests me. Still, most recently, I\u2019ve been enjoying mbti/typology in general or just anything that forces me to understand myself better or make sense of something that seems confusing or difficult at first. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\nAt times, yes. I think I could be good at it, but there are people more fit for it than me. My leadership style tends to be more suggesting, but it can sometimes become more demanding.\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\nI am an artist in an art shop. I tend to draw fanart or original characters. I also constantly change my art style to find something more pleasing to my eyes and quicker and more funner for me. Most of my art is usually conceptual. However, whenever I\u2019m facing an art block I usually immediately turn to vent art with intensely bright and fun colors.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\nI have no idea. I usually tend to dwell on the past whenever I\u2019m at a low, and I\u2019m very nostalgic and enjoy talking about past experiences a lot. When I make decisions, I depend on the present and future. However, I tend to naturally drift off easily from the present moment. I also think about the future a good amount, not in exact detail, but I want to have a vague but practical plan of what I want to be in life and make sure I have backup plans. Apologies if this is all over the place.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\nI\u2019m usually down to help anyone with anything, much to my own fault. I don\u2019t really have a reason, but I also don\u2019t have a reason not to. I don\u2019t struggle saying no, though, but usually, if I\u2019m begged enough or given a bribe, I\u2019ll change my mind pretty quickly. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\nYes. Frustratingly so, but I\u2019ve been trying to ignore it as I grow older since I realize life and people aren\u2019t always logically consistent. \n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\nPretty important, but I\u2019m flexible. I naturally try to be as efficient as possible and get a little mad when I\u2019m slowed down, but similar to the above, I\u2019ve tried to subside this part of me. Productivity is a huge mix for me because I value it and feel awful when I\u2019m unproductive, but I also tend to spend my time sleeping, daydreaming, or doing anything but what I\u2019m supposed to do.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\nSomewhat? I tend to get controlling and manipulative when I\u2019m extremely stressed without realizing it, usually by guilt-tripping. I am also working on this and think I\u2019m making progress.\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\nI\u2019m a 100% hands-on person. Listening or just watching stuff doesn\u2019t help me at all since I get easily distracted or just don\u2019t comprehend it. It\u2019s only when I get to experience things myself is when I understand something. Despite being an artist, I\u2019d hate a class involving creativity. I\u2019d much prefer one logical or memorization.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\nI feel I\u2019m good at strategizing and breaking up projects into manageable tasks, but I never follow through. I always plan something just to throw it out and improvise.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\nI wish to become a character designer for cartoons. I don\u2019t want to be famous myself, but I would love it if something I worked on became famous. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019d like to be a historian of some sorts. I also aspire to live a decent life with a spouse and no kids. I\u2019d also like to own a few pets. Not to be grim, but I also hope and plan to make sure I have a peaceful and natural death. \n\n(rest of answers in comments)", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

I couldn\u2019t find convincing enough arguments why I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to view the bible the way I did. Eventually I left became an atheist, but now I\u2019m back. I can\u2019t get the logic behind traditional churches. I go to a very open and affirming church, however it still has way more tradition than a non denominational church. I need both Tradition, but not too stifling where I have to view everything like they did. \n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it?

However when it\u2019s my own ideas it\u2019s usually the same ones. I just sit and refine that. My ideas are usually just centered around cooking or storytelling. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it?

I just draw whatever I think looks beautiful and what story I want to tell. I don\u2019t really care about making \u201cstatements\u201d with art. I have an imagination, but its not super vivid.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n- I don\u2019t think about the past, present is just now, future is me, but better (hopefully). \n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n- Depends on what it is. I don\u2019t mind helping others out though, but I have to actually be able to help them. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n- I think so.

I'm a very giving person, always doing things for the close ones in my life when I am able to.

Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\nI would probably enjoy it a lot at first, being left to my own interests. But after a day I may become a little lonely or on edge. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\nI would say i\u2019m average at sports. I prefer my activities to be indoors, because of dirt and bugs. \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\nI would say i\u2019m very curious! I love learning a wide range of topics! I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m super smart, but I do love learning. I always have many ideas, but I can\u2019t always execute them which impacts my motivation\u2014 being unable to do them all, slowly drains my creativity. I love learning about science and occasionally true crime. Most ideas I get are related to art or writing, though. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\nOccasionally I might enjoy taking on leadership positions, but for the most part I avoid it because it\u2019s a lot of pressure and I wouldn\u2019t want to be too harsh on people. But, I do have a lot of ideas on how to direct others and how to do things decently (?)\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\nI wouldn\u2019t say i\u2019m very well coordinated.

But, I do work with my hands by doing art and baking!\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\nI\u2019m not very good at staying in the present moment, I have to remind myself to stay in the present very often. My brain is always thinking in the past or future. When looking into the past, I try to learn things from it. I deal with it with humor! For the most part though, I look into the future for possibilities\u2014 good and bad.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\nI do like helping other people to an extent! When I feel like i\u2019m being used, I usually start to feel angry.

I usually help others to build my relationship with them or to be appreciated.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\nMaybe? I try to have a reason or explanation for everything I do, if that\u2019s what this means?\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\nI would say it\u2019s important generally, but I\u2019m not always good at being productive.

When I don\u2019t feel like putting my whole effort into assignments, I try to do all the requirements just enough to where I pass.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\nWhen i\u2019m very stressed, I can be kind of controlling and think that I know what\u2019s best. Also, I can pick up on peoples needs and I do things for them while hoping for things in return. It\u2019s gotten better with time, though. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\nI like art, reading and writing. I like that you can draw anything, read an abundance of books, and write anything. There are a lot of possibilities to be explored and stories to be read! \n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\nI would say i\u2019m a pretty visual and hands on learner! When i\u2019m not in a comfortable environment, I sometimes have a hard time taking in any information. So, usually i\u2019m in a comfortable place to do homework or read. I struggle when people try to verbally explain things, because I can\u2019t completely understand unless i\u2019m seeing an image or if they show me what they\u2019re talking about. Unless I sit down and study really hard, I don\u2019t usually like memorization. I do very well in classes that have very hands on work. I like finding creative and fun ways to study, but sometimes that\u2019s too much work. \n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\nI plan for things, but in the moment I kind of forget everything I planned and just improvise. I do that for most things, just go into it and hope for the best. But if it\u2019s more serious, I try to stick to the plan as closely as possible\u2014 but it\u2019s VERY hard to go according to it. Also, it can get boring when going according to plan. So, sometimes I go an alternative way for more entertainment or fun.  \n\n(Rest is in the replies)", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general \tdescription of yourself.  \n I\u2019m 30 years old male. I am a software developer, about to \tcreate a startup.  \n \n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your \tmental/comportamental stability somehow?  \n I just got totally deaf in 2023, and sometimes I feel depressed \tbecause I miss music. Music used to be one of the tool that could \tmake me happy. I also have been recovering from hyperthyroid, and it \tbreaks one of my eye (I have cross eye). A bit insecure on that. I\u2019m \talso wearing glasses and have quite a large myopia.  \n \n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious \tor structured influence? How did you respond to it?  \n I was raised as Christian, but my mother encouraged me to talk \tand have my own opinion on something. And they are not hover \tparents. So I have capability to learn as much as possible about \toutside world, and make my own opinion about it. That makes me quite \topen-minded and a critical thinker.   \n This all caused me to no \tlonger see the world the same way again. I am no longer religious, \tbecause they just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I understand why \tthere\u2019s religion, it\u2019s because people need reasoning of their \texistence and comfort for their insecurity of death, also building \twhat\u2019s moral to society, and such. But then, as research and era \tgoes on, this has become outdated and no longer make sense on how we \tperceive reality.   \n My mother wishes me to be a faithful \tChristian, but she was willing to try to understand if I defied from \tit, as long as I am a happy and good person.   \n So I am in search \tfor who I am now. It\u2019s like my brain just got changed. I no longer \trelate to who I was in childhood, and I can no longer understand \tmyself the same way before.  \t  \n \n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do \tyou like it? Why or why not?  \n I work as freelance software developer. I like the problem \tsolving part of it, and how it could impact on society as a whole. \tI\u2019m inspired by how technology could benefit society. Even though \tit could be a double-edged sword, but if we could be mature on \ttechnology, the goodness part of it is pretty much worth it. For \texample, using technology to cure diseases, disability.  \t  \n \n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would \tyou feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?  \n I feel good spending time alone. I do need to socialize since I \tam a human and social being who need cooperation to survive. But I \tonly socialize if necessary. I really enjoy my time alone, doing \tresearch, problem solve, pondering and contemplating about things, \ttrying to understand how things work, how this world work. I believe \tif we understand how things work, we could navigate ourselves well \ton it. We could hack or modify it, we could adapt or mold it into \tadapting to us.  \n \n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? \tFor instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors \tevent what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you \ttend to engage i?  \n My father was a sportsman and love doing sports, so I was \tindoctrinated into liking sports and physical activities when I was \ta kid. But then, as I got into adult, I realized that I was not \tinterested in it anymore. But I try to respect myself by doing \tnecessary exercises for health.   \n Or it could also be influenced \tby my physical deterioration, such as my myopia and deafness. I was \tpartially deaf in childhood, but totally deaf now.  \t  \n I also noticed that I like strategy and puzzle games where my \tmind is stimulated and challenged to solve problems and thinking of \tbest way to do things.  \t  \n \n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can \texecute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about \t- is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?  \n People been saying that I am a curious and ambitious person. I \thave an urge to understand how things work, by critically examine \tand asking questions about things.  \t  \n When I have an idea it\u2019s usually about how to solve problems. \tLike, what is the best way to solve world problems, and pros and \tcons of the way to solve it.  \n \n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think \tyou would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?  \n I don\u2019t mind taking the leadership position since laying out \tsteps and giving order and structure is one of my strengths. But I \tdon\u2019t really like the huge responsibility of it. So I just become \tleader if necessary. I much prefer my autonomy. Leader isn\u2019t free \tat all, they need to serve  and understand what people need.  \t  \n As for leadership style, I personally would prefer an environment \twhere we could understand each other\u2019s thinking and could decide \twhat\u2019s the best way to do things. But I could adapt to people by \tfiguring them out first. For example, I would observe the behavior \tof my staffs and use the most compatible leadership style for them. \tEverything will go smoothly and in harmony. There would be order and \tstructure.  \t  \n \n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are \tnot? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe \tyour activity?  \n I don\u2019t know if I could be perceived as coordinated, but I used \tto be good at sports, but not anymore. I enjoy working with my hands \tif it\u2019s aligned with what I like, which is problem solving. Like \trepairing something, or building something, or research and \texperiment.  \n \n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not \tparticular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe \twhat forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.  \n I used to not really like doing artistic stuff, but now after all \tthat has been going on, I find writing and drawing to be a tool for \trelease. I put my thinking and contemplation in a form of creating \twriting and illustrations and I enjoy it. I also appreciate art as \tthey are the tool for me to understand the artist themselves, and \tthe world.  \n \n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How \tdo you deal with them?  \n We learned from the past, focusing on the present, to build the \tfuture.  \n \n* How do you act when others request your help to do something \t(anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?  \n It depends on situation. If I like them, and could see that they \twould reciprocate, I will help them. But if I feel like their motive \tis just to use me, I\u2019m not interested.   \n Also if there\u2019s \tsome impact that were aligned with my values if I help them, I would \tdo it.  \t  \n \n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?  \n I guess so. I need to understand how things works and then \tnavigate myself towards that. Don\u2019t know if that is called logical \tconsistency.  \n \n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?  \n I understand how important is efficiency and productivity on some \tthings, and I am able to do it. But if I have a choice to be able to \tlive freely, I just want to ponder and think, and share what I think \tabout stuffs, maybe in form of writing. I don\u2019t know if that would \tbe perceived as putting productivity as importance.  \n \n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you \tdo that?  \n Only if necessary. I simply putting a strong pros and cons \targument and the why. Trying to convince people why they should obey \tme, or do this and that. I relay the pros that would benefit them.  \n \n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?  \n Playing video games, strategy and puzzle games. I like them \tbecause they stimulate my mind, and showing me how the reality could \tbe different than the world we live in. also trying to create and \tbuild stuffs to solve problems.  \t  \n \n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning \tenvironments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle \twith these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving \tmemorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?  \n So far, I don\u2019t have resources to get structured learning, so I \thave to structure it all by myself. Like watching different people \ttutorials on youtube and then structuring it myself. But if able, I \twish I could spend money for a more efficient structured learning. I \tcould learn faster and more effective that way.  \t  \n I would prefer classes that provide me all the information I need \tto do what I want to do. On the point classes, I suppose.  \t  \n \n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up \tprojects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing \tprojects and improvise as you go?  \n Since the environment I live in are where people are mostly \tpassive, so I often need to take initiative on strategizing and \tsuch. I am able to lay out steps and tasks, giving order and \tstructure, but I could also pivot / wing projects if necessary. I am \table to think of creative solution quickly.  \n \n* What's important to you and why?  \n I still don\u2019t know, I feel detached on this world, and trying \tto understand how the world work first. By that, I guess I could \tfind what\u2019s important for me. But as for realistic stuffs, I guess \tmy parents and people that have helped me survive are important to \tme.  \n \n* What are your aspirations?  \n I guess I just want to solve problems and make an ideal situation \tfor the greater good. I like harmony environment where everything \tgoes smoothly. For example, I am thinking of an ideal world where \tpeople stop doing wars and start collaborating. In theory, they \tcould do that. But they choose not to. Why? I\u2019m trying to \tunderstand the root of the problem and do something to solve it.  \t  \n \n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do \tyou hate? Why?  \n I fear depending on others and losing my autonomy. I hate when \tpeople are trying to bring down a vibe just for their own pleasure \tand satisfaction. Disruption of harmony, I guess? Things like pure \tchaos and disorder also made me uncomfortable, like a condition when \twe are all just doing things without any purpose and goal. We need \tto better the world, we need to keep improving.  \n \n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?  \n When everything is in harmony with my mind, and everything goes \tsmoothly according to what I wish.  \t  \n \n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?  \n The opposite of above.  \n \n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do \tyou pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you \taware of your surroundings while you do so?  \n Based on my answers above, I think this could be concluded. I am \toften in my head contemplating.  \n \n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is \tnothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think \tabout?  \n \n\n\tI will think about why am I here, for what purpose. After I figure it all out, I will choose whether I want to participate in it or not. If not, I will figure out the way to escape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do \tyou change your mind once you've made it?  \n Moderate time I guess. I will lay out pros and cons of a \tdecision. And I might change my mind if my decision is really wrong \tand things doesn\u2019t turn out as I\u2019ve hoped when I made my \tdecision.  \n \n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important \tare emotions in your life?  \n Till now, I still don\u2019t understand my own emotions. I mean I \tunderstand what makes me sad and happy, but I see no inherent \tmeaning of it. I\u2019m more of a thinker I guess.  \t  \n \n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to \tappease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?  \n Yes if it\u2019s necessary for my own \u201csurvival\u201d, like, if I \tdisagree with them they would get angry and something bad will \thappen to me.  \t  \n \n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be \tchallenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why \twould you?  \n I challenge authority if they are being incompetent or not doing \tthings has expected from what it should be. For example, incompetent \tpastors that didn\u2019t really understand theology and just want the \tmoney he could get from tithes.  \t  \n I will break the rules if I think it\u2019s necessary for the better \tthings that I\u2019ve thought of.  \n \n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?  \n \n\n\tI think an ideal life for me is simply freedom. Where I have all the hierarcy of needs fulfilled, or have access to it.    \n\n\n  \n\n\nThank you kindly for taking the time to type me. i'd personaly prefer if we could use cognitive function stacks approach.

{"submission": " Howdy! I've been learning about MBTI for a couple months now, but I've been recently having trouble deciding which one fits me most.  In tests I'm usually typed as ISTP and INTP, and ESTP is pretty up there. I've been looking into ENTP as well, and I find it fairly relatable as well in some points. I'd consider the extroverted types more likely because I feel energized when talking to others, just that I don't enjoy just going up to people randomly and way too large gatherings. Otherwise I consider myself pretty firmly a XXTP type,  I've also typed as a 9w8 enneagram and a 783 tritype, though not sure how relevant that could be.  Other general points from the pinned guide:  \n\n\u2022    I'm 18, male. I'm generally very optimistic. I usually present as very chill, but get amped up fairly quickly, especially if I'm going out to do something. I like to just go out and see a new place, and rope others into it, though kinda lose interesting in doing something new if I can't share it with others.  \n\n\u2022    I have no known conditions that might impact the way I act.  \n\n\u2022    I had a pretty sheltered upbringing. Work prioritized play because of my grandma's background in teaching, but I still had plenty of time to play. I was roped into after school activities and private classes whenever possible. As a kid I always tried negotiating how much I'll work, if I'll do it at all, I'll do it for a reward etc. At some point I just kinda accepted it as is, which bottled up into a lot of resentment when I grew to an age where they couldn't force me to do specific things.\n\n \u2022    I've had a summer job as a handyman's apprentice, and it was a fairly fun experience, going around and just mucking about, had fun seeing how things are fixed and helping around. I've combed and readjusted what I want to to so many times because I couldn't decide, but right now I'm looking into agriculture, political sciences, and law/criminal justice, former because I like biology and knowing how organisms work, latter because I like studying rules and how systems work. \n\n\u2022    I don't think I could spend an entire weekend entirely on my own. I just have a way too large of a urge to either hear or see people, always kept the TV or something playing in the background to make up for it if I was alone. \n\n \u2022    I generally prefer going out, especially busy places (though not parties). I'd love to go out fishing, camping, hiking and the like, though I often spend time home on my hobbies due to circumstances of not having enough time or others being busy. \n\n\u2022    I like learning about something new, whatever it may be about. I've gave up on more things than I have started. I've got a knack for discussing theoretical and intangible, and discussing possible ideas, but at least learnt to take the most possible or practical approach (or I'd like to think so at least). I like to discuss psychology and to an extent philosophy l, though that I dislike delving too deep into because it ends pretty ugly from 1st and 2nd hand experience. Otherwise I like discussing those because I like to learn how people tick. \n\n\u2022    I have no problem taking om some kind of leadership role if need be, though I'd rather just be let to do my own thing within the group. If I am a leader, I just usually, again, let people do the thing they're good at, and motivate them to improve. \n\n \u2022    I at least feel like I'm well coordinated. I play the accordion which requires both hands and sometimes eyes to work in tandem, and I also draw which I guess might be also there. I always need to be fiddling with something. \n\n \u2022    I am artistic in the sense that I do art, but I'm not sure if I'm really all that expressive in it. I draw, though it's mostly just characters I find cool, or if I'm designing a character for a DnD game or the like. I play the accordion, and again I'm mostly concerned if it sounds well and 8/10 times it's a song I like rather than one I feel particularly emotional about. \n\n \u2022    Past happened and shouldn't be worried all too much about, takes me a bit to move on from some things, but once I do I almost never think about them again. Present is very important and should be used as much as possible. Future we can always figure out as we go, and thoroughly planning it out is pointless if it means losing out on the now, or of a circumstance demands it be changed. \n\n \u2022    I help others if it's not an inconvenience to me, it requires a skill I am proud of possessing, or it would mean a lot to them. \n\n \u2022    I know life is illogical, but if I can't form any logic around it, I get lost. \n\n \u2022    I like to make things more efficient if I see how I could do it, but I'll forego it if deem it unnecessary or a less optimal thing is more fun or interesting. \n\n \u2022    I don't really control others is what I like to think. I've been told I'm good with words and can persuade well, but I haven't used it to the detriment of others. \n\n \u2022    Art, specifically drawing and playing an instrument, because I can produce things I personally find visually or auditory pleasing. I also enjoy lifting because I enjoy the feeling of being strong. \n\n \u2022    I hate large group learning because there are often distractions and it's usually very dumbed down. I prefer smaller groups or 1 on 1 where I can ask as much or as little as I want. I enjoy flexing my mental muscles and putting things together logically, specifically with sciences like biology and physics. Memorization is awful, I'd rather if I can know key points and intuit the rest myself. \n\n \u2022    I just wing projects. I'll have a rough idea of what I want to do, but I'll never fully plan it out. Even if I do, I'll overlook something. \n\n \u2022   No high aspirations professionally nor personally, I just want get better at my creative endeavors and have a sustainable well paying job.  \n\n \u2022    I fear not being important to others close to me in my life and that I won't have a significant impact on them, especially if that means being left behind. It probably stems from some existential fear of being forgotten. \n\n \u2022    My highs are when I can just let loose and have a good laugh with my family or friends. \n\n \u2022    Lows are mostly just moot points where I'm alone and left to my own devices when there's nothing to do. It's more like being bored because I manage to make the best out of the situation. \n\n \u2022    I'm fairly aware of reality and often pull down others, even if I like to theorize and brainstorm myself. I like to daydream a fair bit, but I'm mostly aware of what's happening around me. \n\n \u2022    If I'm left alone, I'm probably thinking of what I could do next today, thinking up a deck or character to make, what new place to eat and drink at to visit. \n\n \u2022    Important decisions usually just stew at the back of my mind, and I just wing it. I'll think about the decision after for a bit, but I'll disregard it, whatever the outcome. \n\n \u2022    Emotions awful to manage, but in a \"idk it just feels bad/good\" and that's as much as I cam elaborate. I just let them sit around and whatever happens with them happens. I don't place much importance on them, though I like to be vulnerable when I'm with a really close friend or alone. \n\n \u2022    I don't agree with others for the sake of agreeing, I just say something along the lines of \"It's whatever, let's just keep going\". \n\n \u2022    I like to figure out how to work within the rules, ie have them work for me. I challenge authority in the way of wanting them to prove they are competent at what they do first, if I think they are bad at it, I'll either disregard or argue back. If I break a rule, it's because I find it illogical or its existence is redundant or actively making things worse. ", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": " ESTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "I'm having a type identity crisis and would like to find out my true type! I'm in my mid-20s and have been into mbti for many years, and I'd typically score INFP on tests, up until 1-2 years ago. After many life experiences and growth, I now hold beliefs that are very uncommon for an INFP, and I get different results every time I take tests. I also know FiNe isn't responsible for every user having the same values, but there are definitely tendencies for each type to lean towards. **The things that make me doubt being INFP include:**\n\n\\-Fi is about subjective values, but I believe in objectivity in everything from morality to good art to beauty. Sometimes my views are controversial, but I know objective truth is always there regardless of what period in history you are in. People are entitled to hold different beliefs, but sometimes they're just wrong\n\n\\-INFPs are often described to be compassionate and caring advocates, but I honestly can't say that about myself. I care a lot about my loved ones, and my life is centred around these relationships, but I have never been big into social justice causes. There are issues that I have a lot of opinions on and can get into heated debates about, and sometimes there are issues that make my blood boil, but I hate the feeling of being pressured to \"act on something\" or virtue signal\n\n\\-people might think I'm materialistic. I value my appearance a lot and do my utmost to look and dress well. I love a clean and nice-looking home. One of my biggest joys in life is enjoying high-quality food and taking care of my body. I know everyone can enjoy these things, but is this incongruent with Se blind spot? On the other hand, I feel my Se isn't that well-developed because I'm not naturally physically reactive, and I don't \"easily blend into my environment\" with ease\n\n\\-while I used to like reading fiction a lot, nowadays I find myself only reading non-fiction and material that actually has a tangible impact on my life\n\n\\-one of my strengths is that I'm a very logical thinker, and one of my pet peeves is when people deliberately miss the point or purposefully try not to understand what I'm saying\n\n**On the other hand, things that make sense with being INFP include:**\n\n\\-I've always had a dreamy nature, always optimistic about the future and the sky's the limit for what I believe could happen\n\n\\-I'm really into self-knowledge and development, exploring my identity through time, and as you can see there's a lot of focus on the self, on what I want and what I believe. I always know exactly how I'm feeling and am very self-aware\n\n\\-sometimes I have very strong reactions to certain people (possibly from strong Fi, which I'm working on), and I can \"hate\" them just from one sentence they said, but I rarely show it physically or confront them. I just ignore them\n\n\\-I have a lot of thoughts ranging from the everyday to the metaphysical, my mind is quite active\n\n\\-I can be quite sentimental about certain things, and sometimes thinking about a particular scene from a movie for example can make me cry\n\nI think I generally use Fi more than Fe, not sure about Te/Ti or Ne/Ni, good use of Si, and not sure about Se. If anyone could help me find my true type, I'd be really grateful!!!", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m a female minor currently in High School so that should be enough time for my 2nd function to show up now. I\u2019m a born and raised Southeast Asian who moved to the US during my 7-8th years of existence and I must remind myself to use my one of my inner voice of thought like this is written to me and only to me to achieve somewhat unbiased answers that may not derail the JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF COGNITION in which I am the defendant without an attorney, and I\u2019m being blinded by the sole spotlight in a dark room as I try to take a good look at the 8 judges whispering in an eloquent language I\u2019m too dumb to understand. Which means I\u2019m not allowed to hide my crimes behind my identity forgings. Dammit. Also, what the hell is with the influx of people going \u201cAhahaha, type me based off my pics lolol XD\u201d *inserts random pics that offers nothing but suggest they\u2019re just doing this out of disrespect* ?? Do tell, I\u2019m super confused. Anyways, I\u2019m often perceived by strangers and not-very-close acquaintances as a upbeat bubbly kind of girl who switches very quickly to the quiet girl but if one digs deeper, they\u2019ll see a gremlin who at this point is just winging life but also stressing about it like some contradiction like a lazy perfectionist, who thinks of weird thoughts like what it feels like to be a rotisserie chicken in PE and spins around instead of participating ohhhh now, this is not a good example of general description folks. Ok fine. I\u2019m a introverted stubborn, lazy perfectionist/procrastinator, undisciplined, passionate for a few things and then it slowly fizzles out then gets reignited again, indifferent to the rest,  social mimic \\[take note idk who i truly am, so don't assume that this is the real ego talking but simply a reflection in a house of mirrors\\], inconsiderate, nonjudgmental (unless you do something stupid, concerning, or illegal) with no real hobbies except art and gaming.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nUnknown. Probability: 0.5%. I don\u2019t know if anger issues/temper counts. Most likely that\u2019s genetic from my father\u2019s side. Unfortunately, I am worse at controlling it than he is, thanks to the fact that he\u2019s 40-something idk but it's wisdom and patience from old age and having 2 kids.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI don\u2019t have any religious or structured influence in my upbringing, no mention of the mere concept of it, save for the time my cousins and I came across my paternal grandfather putting bowls of sweet bean porridge on an altar. I asked if I could eat it because my brain tells me that nobody just leaves out fresh food near a statue so that statue must be pretty important to someone so obv, I should ask. He tells us that we have to pray for it, so my cousin kneels and starts saying stuff I don't understand and I just mimic them for the food. No questions asked. Other than that, I wasn\u2019t disciplined much or was enforced rules upon since my parents were busy working to gather money to move out the house to another house then later to the US for my brother\u2019s and my education. So I sort of figured my way around in my younger years with a bit of guidance from my parents and cartoon shows, and some figuring out/adopting from my peers. It got stricter in the nagging as I grew but still not much rule enforcement. Not even bedtime, just a disappointed sigh. *thumbs up*\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don\u2019t have a job but I\u2019d imagine if I got some regular boring ol\u2019 part time job, I\u2019d be overly aware of the passage of time from the constant glances at the clock or my phone.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nBro. I\u2019d feel scared. I\u2019m not used to the absence of my guardians or meatshields (sorry). I\u2019d stay up awake with a knife under my pillow ready to attack a possible home intruder (I don\u2019t trust my home\u2019s security system for good reason) and would turn on the AC all day so the unnerving silence would go away.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like it, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI dislike most things physical. I\u2019m forced to take mixed martial arts by my parents for a year and I still hate it even though I know it\u2019s for self defense. I\u2019m not good at sports, my body coordination sucks and my fine coordination still sucks even though I\u2019m an intermediate artist. I can\u2019t throw, or catch, or serve, or smack anything at all for the life of me. I think I\u2019ll stick to staying inside with the AC, thanks.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI don\u2019t know to be honest. I was not born with curiosity and if I was, it was probably squashed like most other kids. I noticed an uptick in questions around my 13th year of existence but it was not a \u201cWhy? Why? Why?\u201d situation even though 10% of the time it is. There's been another uptick in curiosity this year since I learned that my bio teacher is over qualified for his job since he has a PhD in biology so whenever we\u2019re doing an assignment or in work time, I\u2019d go up and ask questions about related stuff and deeper clarification. Then I proceed to forget most of the stuff. My memory sucks.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nDepends. If it\u2019s not something I\u2019m good at, I won\u2019t take charge. If it is something I\u2019m good at, I\u2019d want to take charge (since I have an idea of what I want it to be) but if there\u2019s someone else better, they\u2019ll get it. Leadership positions in general however are stress-inducing and it means I\u2019m placing responsibility on myself, there's a higher chance my temper will flare, and I will slack off and get disappointment from the people I\u2019m supposed to lead. I don\u2019t know what my leadership style would be. Definitely not authoritarian. Hopefully.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n(See physical activities question) I draw and paint digitally so I suppose yes. I like creating things and I like stories so art is good for smooshing two together.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nMy art is semi-realistic, like those Asian video game art styles (like reverse 1999 and Genshin but worseee in render and sketch and all those fundamentals), since I was influenced by it when I first started developing that skill.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI don\u2019t know honestly. I don\u2019t think I have much of an opinion on time but I guess I\u2019d approve if the past is acknowledged and remembered but it doesn\u2019t get in the way of progression and change of the future, since trying to keep the past and project it onto progress will stagnate it or even degrade it and ruin what we have built when the future has the potential to be better is dumb but trying to throw away the past for the sake of the future means discarding learned wisdom and experience from history and tradition. Imagine 35% past, 65% future. The present? The present is okay I guess.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIn society, I feel obliged to help. With the people I\u2019m okay with, I would usually off-load tasks to others if they\u2019re difficult or boring and I will show it unintentionally or not. If I did actually help them, it could be for multiple reasons like I\u2019m bored, I did smth bad earlier and now I feel the pressure and this is my silent way of saying sorry because i don\u2019t like apologizing even though I know I am fully capable of saying it just fine, just wanna help lol, the task is fun, I\u2019m curious, etc. All in all, I don't like working.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYES. But why? Hmm, I think if there\u2019s no logical consistency, nothing can be understood and I\u2019d very much like to understand the reality (or is it? *Vsauce music intensifies*) in which I inhabit, thank you very much. I know this is not the fundamental reason why I need logical consistency and I myself do not know yet so I\u2019ll just list possible answers: Truth? So I don\u2019t go insane from my human composition, fearing the reality in which I inhabit from its lack of predictability and sense? Maybe it's a human condition to understand how the object relates to the subject in an attempt to find understanding and thus peace within itself and existence and thus some turn to logic to find it and others turn to emotions for it. Wait. That\u2019s just for consistency-\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nPretty important. Well, mostly for efficiency. I value not wasting my time suffering in work so taking the most efficient route means less time to suffer and also less work and I have more time to use it for unproductive stuff like gaming :)). Productivity is also somewhat important for me, I want to be productive so I can make a difference in the world (huge progression of sciences!) and leave my mark knowing dang well my life isn\u2019t a waste of existence among the people who settled for working for corporations who just want money and does nothing in the long run like come on, you\u2019re just one of the millions of rich ceos in a history of rich ceos) but in practice, I am rarely productive. I\u2019m no stereotypical xsxjs. If you want stereotypical xsxj, go talk to my mom.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nSomewhat. I dunno how (I know this is for Te vs Fe and I can do both, just poorly. I lack the charisma for it lol) but I know that I do somewhat. I mainly did it for their own good (ei i think they\u2019re doing something stupid or making it less fun for themselves and I want them to have fun or at least don't regret their actions.) Nowadays it's less since I don't really care anymore. *shrugs*\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI don't really have hobbies other than gaming and art. I find gaming is a serotonin giving mixture of technical skills (kudos to the coders who is sobbing in overtime, the musicians with sore limbs from the constant playing for osts etc etc) and artistic skill (writing, design, animation) and there are more reasons why I like my games. They offer: mental stimulation in puzzles, story, calculation for damages etc, some socialization for a lazy introvert without much irl consequences of accidentally saying smth wrong, wisdom (through playing the story, we may gain some wisdom on \u201creal life\u201d like how to steal stuff :) or even deduce mysteries), and it's also a way to do things you can\u2019t in real life like infinite scuba diving and beat up enemies and one shot em.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI struggle mostly in boring and tedious classes. I don\u2019t want to hear you go on and on about your dead husband for the 15th time this month as if it relates to what we\u2019re learning about even though he sounds like a pretty cool dude I guess. I prefer learning through logical discussion, experimentation, fun, engaging stuff, and figure things out with help and guidance ofc. I don't wanna memorize stuff, that\u2019s braindead. I wanna get to the bottom of things, and find the fundamental principle that can help me figure out new information. I wanna see everything connecting to everything in a way that makes sense bc for reasons unknown. I remember I got giddy because we have history SOL essay recently, and was given a prompt to answer and absolutely no directions but to answer it and ofc, I procrastinated but dang, me researching for stuff to answer that SOL prompt and going on spirals (and then stop bc i need to get enough info and sleep)  was stupidly fun in a weird way even if it\u2019s first period tmmr and I\u2019m sleep deprived. And ofc, visual learning is okay as well.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\u2026I\u2019m going to say this once. I have learned that behaviorism does not equate to cognitive functions and thus we can have a dumb, illogical istp and a smart enfj. I want you to type my cognition, not my behavior and skills. Anyways, I\u2019m average in strategizing but not long term consequences. I do not possess wisdom and experience a skilled strategist should have nor have I studied strategy. I write down the general goal, and when able would plan for it but when I can\u2019t, would just wing it just fine. Just stressfully if it\u2019s an important thing.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n    I would like to not di. I want to create and discover new important things, specifically in the science and engineering field and have my influence echo in humanity in a good way. I want to achieve the title of Art God. I want really close friends like the ones you\u2019d see in tv shows. I wanna help humanity advance towards a better future with my contribution towards stem fields. I wanna revolutionize the education system. I wanna NOT have sleep deprivation, thanks. I also want to learn criminology for the heck of it.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear creepy crawlies like most do and I still fear the absence of light even though I know that it\u2019s just the absence of photons, what I\u2019m truly afraid of the dark for is the possibility that I am not alone. Anyways, I feel uncomfortable witnessing people being affectionate (gross) and breaking basic social niceties (like straight up telling a stranger they wanna punch them).\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nThey don\u2019t exist.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI get even more moody and irritable, my anger flares, my patience decreases even more, and I\u2019m completely blind to the consequences of emotionally hurting people. I get defensive over my thoughts and ideas and will target others known weak points for it. This is the lowest point I have reached thus far in my existence so it may not be the lowest of lows but thankfully I don't explode that long to that extreme. Usually it\u2019s brief and rare (like once every 5 years?) provided that I am able to isolate myself away from people, the spark to the fuse, anyways.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nSometimes I get absorbed in a stream of sensations when I have nothing to do (mostly when chilling with my friends during lunch time and listening to them talk), and I just look around out of boredom. But I do daydream or think about something often that I briefly lose perception of time and space. I still do have basic visual awareness during this but energy is delegated to the visualization and language parts of the brain to produce my inner voice and daydreams.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI\u2019d think about why the hell am i even in a blank, empty room, then start to wonder if this is reality or a dream, then wonder if I\u2019m in a psych ward or if this is some isolation torture tactic because I\u2019ve somehow came across things I shouldnt know and currently do not know, then try to find my way out, fail, then sit around thinking of my regrets and the true meaning of existence, and then yell at the walls at my imaginary warden for self-entertainment but maybe also just in case I\u2019m actually right, then dance around like I\u2019m in a fantasy ballroom and then cue fight scene, and then I start talking to myself about Dimensions and human perception. And then if I\u2019m not out of there within 24 hours, I\u2019ll die from my lack of human needs before I die from insanity. End.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt\u2019ll take me at least a day to make a really important decision, I\u2019d imagine, from all the researching about my options and my decision before I made the decision and the discussion with others for perspective and staring at my blank tablet screen. And I can very easily change my mind after the decision is made either from new info or new realizations and I\u2019ll act as if I\u2019ll die from my terrible decision.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nIt takes me fairly quickly to process them. It\u2019s not that I suppress them a lot, maybe some of it is repressed sadness that bubbles up in the silent hours and I am unaware and surprised at its existence but sometimes I feel nothing at all. It\u2019s fairly important I guess, but obv, sense has to be placed over emotion and I think I can push it aside to prioritize what must and should be done from a thoughtful standpoint rather than rash impulse of chemicals.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nOccasionally. But mostly, nope. I\u2019d just tell them I disagree and usually it comes off in a non-aggressive way since I don't feel aggression towards their opinion, I just thought I\u2019d let them know I disagree and then we can come to a wiser perspective, aye?\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't really break rules since I don't like conflict directed at me and also because I have better things to do in my life but I do think authority should be challenged. Humans require challenges or conflict to achieve good decisions and innovation as it forces upon them responsibility and accountability to be and do better instead of taking the easy way out and slack off and oppress people. Sometimes rules are just plain stupid so sure, maybe I\u2019ll break some rules but I haven\u2019t come across such rules without some shred of reason behind them.

{"submission": "21m\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?  \nNever been diagnosed, but I think I struggle with general anxiety and depression.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?  \nMy Mother had me go to church twice a week for years, and I enjoyed it. We had to memorized bible verses on Wednesdays and recite them to our group leaders. I was especially good at this. I spent a lot of time out playing with friends after school known as the class clown. Was involved in a lot of sports, clubs, and was in some of the gifted classes. Started to become more of an introvert around middle school and onwards.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?  \nI'm in school for a science degree. It's fine, but I wish I had more time to really understand the subjects.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?  \nGenerally speaking, I'd feel refreshed.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?  \nYeah, I love sports. Long distance running was one of my passions, but I have this condition with my legs that doesn't allow me to do that anymore. I like to play indoor soccer with my friends. Any kind of sport is fun to me.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?  \nI'm a reasonably curious person. I'd say that I execute more than most of my ideas. I'm usually curious why people act the way that they do. I like thinking about the future, how society will change, and how society has gotten to where it is. Here is an example: I was looking at the stars the other night and was  thinking about how people never really talk about the stars anymore. I started asking myself questions like \"Is it because we become more practical when we get older? Is it because we lose our curiosity from childhood? I then thought that it was important to look at the stars because it reminds us of our role in the grand scheme of things. But then maybe thats also why people don't look up as much.\" Then two weeks later the answer will hit me as thing are usually on my mind in the background for awhile.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?  \nI'd be fine with a leadership position. I feel like I would be pretty effective at getting people organized, but my anxiety is what holds me back from doing so. It would be fun, but public speaking drags me down. \n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?  \nYeah, I'm coordinated. I play drumset and have for years. I play piano too. I enjoy working with my hands.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.  \nI'm a musician and I am obsessed with music.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?I feel like I do a poor job of dealing with them.   \nI try to reflect on the past and learn whatever lessons I can and apply them to the present. I also try to focus on growth everyday and sustaining habits so I am prepared for the future. I plan for the future the best that I can.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?  \nI help with enthusiasm. I know how good it feels when someone is there for me so I want to replicate that feeling for them. Helping others feels good, but not when it changes someone's expectation of me. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?  \nFor the most part, but not completely.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?  \nIt's pretty important.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?  \nThe only time that I control others is when I try to get a group organized by breaking things down logically out loud and communicating about any discrepancies. I couldn't ever imagine trying to manipulate someone emotionally.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?  \nI like playing instruments. I like the form of self expression and having fun playing in bands.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?  \nI like to be alone in a completely silent room with the content I need to learn. If I am in a classroom, I can't ask questions on everything that I don't fully understand. I learn best when I have a subject that I can look at from every angle. I feel satisfied with topic when I actually know the why to everything. I get frustrated in classes involving creativity because they always want you to do it a particular way. When I am creative I am want full freedom to do things as I wish them to be done. I don't like it when creativity is judged and graded like that by institutions.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?  \nI'm pretty good at strategizing and getting things done on big tasks.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?  \nPersonally, I want to grow into the best version of myself and exchange as much love as I can. I want to try and overcome the anxiety and depression I face. Professionally, I want a career that has as big of a positive impact on society as I can make.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?  \nI'm terrified of public speaking and sort of people in general. Being outgoing and charismatic makes me uncomfortable. I wanna be goofy or serious with people I know. I have a hard time putting on a facade and trying to relate to people I have no relation with. But, sometimes I am good at it. I hate when people act unkindly.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?  \nI'm getting up and putting in the work with school, going to the gym, reading, rehearsing, performing, and effective with all of my time.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?  \nSulking depressed in my bed all day.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?  \nI'm somewhat attached to reality. I daydream rerunning interactions in my head or just pondering on what I read earlier.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?  \nIt usually takes me awhile and I get locked in.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?  \nIt takes me a long time to process my emotions.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?  \nYeah, I will if it's something trivial. Maybe too often. I don't want to upset someone when there's no good reason for it. We don't really have time to be bogged down at everything we say all the time. If it's an appropriate setting I like  questioning what people say. I like hearing people's thoughts a lot.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?  \nNot really. If I know there are no consequences, then I don't mind breaking the rules if it makes more sense. Authority should always be challenged with questions.  \n\n\nThanks to anyone who provides some input on this questionnaire.

{"submission": "Or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.. Maybe it's not that important, cuz most important are probably first 4 functions, and also everybody is complex so it's pretty limiting but still I don't really relate to Fi trickster cuz - well let's say, I don't know who I really am - I hate this bc I don't even know how to explain my thoughts on this topic lol, so I don't know who I am, I'm just me, that's all, regular person, like everybody else, I don't have a sense of identity or uniqueness, I'd rather be regular than unique I think?

I feel constant sadness and I know I'm feeling it, I just don't focus on it but I know it is there and I try to run away from it. I never think deeply about it but I usually know how I feel at the moment - which is indifferent or sad (sometimes I don't) when someone asks me. I also prioritize my own emotions, I don't wanna feel sad, so I pursue everything to make myself happy. Whoever would want to be sad anyway?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless it's about things like opinions.. then I actually don't feel any strong emotion to (almost) any of my opinions, (I exclude really personal things like family etc ofc) I can quickly change them aaand I don't get defensive or whatever when someone disagrees with me but rather would always want to know why and compromise or smth. Like I have some views and frameworks on certain topics, but I'm not connected to them like ANYTHING and can change them if I find something better or whatever\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also don't feel like I have a duty in this world or any passions at all, I just do what I want in the moment and that's all? I don't know. Usually I don't even know what's happening inside me unless someone explains it to me\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure about my moral code, I don't get it at all. Like of course I know it's bad to make someone else feel bad on purpose or whatever, hurting someone? I don't know what morality is destined to be.. don't you just naturally feel what's wrong and what's right? Like you think - killing someone is bad (except self defense) because it literally is bad and everyone can agree on that, and helping someone is good? Hurting someone verbally or physically is bad, providing care is good? Doesn't everybody feel it?\n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Yeah I'm just gonna give a list of tidbits I'd say are informative about who I am. Hopefully some of you can make sense of it.\n\n\nI was a precocious know-it-all as a kid until I realized it made me unlikable. I'm still a know-it-all but now I'm a lot more tactful about it.\n\nI struggle to delegate at work since I prefer to do everything myself so I can do it perfectly, even if it takes forever. Time constraints give me anxiety, and every single manager I've ever had has complained I work too slow, when I'm not panicking that is. \n\nI stubbornly prefer to do things my (often inefficient) way and I'm not good at taking advice unless I deem the person qualified enough to give it.\n\nI find it really difficult to appreciate things or activities I don't find meaningful to me, and I worry it makes me seem pretentious. \n\nI'll get so amped to yell at the customer servive rep about why I'm still receiving mail from the ISP I stopped using five years ago, but then I crumble as soon as I hear the sweet middle-aged woman on the other end.\n\nI disapprove of people who live for tradition and comfort, but I find myself repeating the same old hedonistic habits to make myself feel better about my dissatisfaction.\n\nI don't really take an interest in people unless something about them strikes me as especially interesting.\n\nI'm insanely sensitive and emotional, but I try my hardest not to let others see it because I don't want to make it their problem.\n\nNothing annoys me more than the chatty new coworker who wants to know every little mundane fact about me, but I try and play along because I don't want to hurt their feelings.\n\nI don't pay much attention to my surroundings and can't remember street names for the life of me, but I have an excellent sense of direction once I've been around a place.\n\nI'm very easily frustrated, but I refuse to allow myself to take it out on others, even when it's their fault. I do have a problematic habit of taking it out on objects when nobody's looking though.  \n\nI tend to fantasize about doing things more than I actually do them. I prefer to set everything up before I do it rather than figure it out as I go, so I  can let my muscle memory go on autopilot and free up space to think about something more interesting, like that novel I keep fantasizing about writing.\n\nI don't want to be disliked, but I also don't really make an active effort to be liked. I prefer to just act like a decent person and wait for people to notice. \n\nI hate being served because I think it's wrong that somebody should have to pretend to be nice to me to earn a living, so I tip 30% as a rule no matter how broke I am. I am not smart.\n\nI had my dad make me a praying mantis costume out of felt for Halloween one year because it was my favorite bug.\n\nI don't like receiving gifts because I don't want to owe anyone anything.\n\n99% of the time I'd rather read a Wikipedia article than make small talk.\n\nI can't fall asleep without smoking a little weed or meditating because my brain never shuts the fuck up.\n\nIn highschool I played bass in a band, and I was the annoying meticulous one who'd always interrupt to remind the other guys about the extra bar before the chorus in Sympathy for the Devil, for example.\n\nI'm not very good at comforting someone who's feeling down, but I try to listen and come up with solutions so I can at least be useful.\n\nI don't feel too bad about lying to others if I really need to, but I find it impossible to lie to myself, as useful as that might be.\n\nI try to own all my mistakes, but when I was younger I used to pretend they were intentional because I didn't want to admit I was fallible.\n\nI love learning about New Age woo woo shit, even though I can't bring myself to believe in any of it.\n\nI'm not competitive and get absolutely nothing out of beating people in games.

{"submission": "Let\u2019s say I\u2019m walking home from school. I wait a few minutes so that I make sure that the streets are clear, and so I could be out alone after all other students have gone home. (Yes, I\u2019m in my mid teens and that it\u2019s more difficult to find your type like this, but I\u2019m confident I can.) Since this schoolyear started, I\u2019ve been analyzing how my mind behaves itself when I walk outside, when alone or with a friend.\n\nWhen alone, I\u2019ve observed that as I walk, I look to the plants, the grass, or the nice houses, since it\u2019s the nicer part of town. An example of a thought chain I found most common is the following: I\u2019d look at the plants and go \u201cWow, look at how healthy they look, I wonder what their owner thinks of it. They should be proud. Do others walking by appreciate the life and beauty it has?\u201d Then I remember a while back in my trail where I saw one of those same flower from the bush, the flower ripped from its stem and had been all trampled, seeing symbolism. \u201cI doubt it, the other students ignorant.\u201d Then the flower appears in my mind again, and then I mull over its sorrowful image as I see some more ahead as well, seems like students constantly rip them out. My mind starts thinking about morals, global warming, and how people are so careless with this beautiful Earth.\n\nAll of that happens in about a second, and then I can basically choose to indulge in that sudden burst or not, since I still understand all of that without actively using my mind, but not as clearly compared to actually taking the time to break that down. If I do choose to analyze it, I break it apart so that it isn\u2019t just a blurry insight with so many thoughts in them.\n\nThis same thing can happen when I walk with my friend, and she sometimes has to repeat certain things she\u2019s said because I tuned her out as I did this in my environment or just spent time in my mind. Evidently I don\u2019t mean to.\n\nAnother thing I wanted to share was that let\u2019s say I was working in an assignment and reading something, and someone sat next to me. It\u2019s common for me to not be able to focus on the matter at hand because now I have a \u201cspectator.\u201d My mind just rambles on saying \u201cI have to look studious and productive next to this person, I have to silently show them how much of  pro and hard worker I am. What do they think of me right now? They\u2019re definitely observing my every movement.\u201d I think about that so much thatI can\u2019t FULLY consentrate on the task at hand. \n\nThe thing is that before I got a younger sibling, that\u2019s now two and extremely boisterous, I have not been able to be completely home alone like I used to. The walls in my apartment are thin, and there is only one room in the apartment with a proper door. I can\u2019t even lock it because my mother needs to be walking in and out to change my sister ir to just get stuff since it\u2019s her room. This is a constant distraction because I have to stand up every ten minutes to open the door and then do that again to lovk it. If I know that I don\u2019t have an entire day for myself free of distractions or outside responsibilities like my sister, I\u2019m generally not motivated to work efficiently. I used to spend so much time alone, so much time to reflect on my life, and so much time to just be with myself, it was my favorite thing in the world, but now it\u2019s taken away, and I just feel like everything is chaotic. \n\nNow that I\u2019m taking AP and honor classes, I have been reunited with old classmates, my friends, compared to previous years where I was in regular classes and constantly annoyed by the other students who were strangers to me. I think that has a role to play too, most of my friends are energetic and naturally goofy off, even if I try bringing them back. I need the class time because I know once I get home, the chances of being productive for a prolonged oeriod of time is low, but they shine under pressure and generally leave things for later. I witnessed my work ethic slip from my fingers, now being okay with grades in the 70s or 80s when it used to be something revolting to me. To be fair, my classes definitely are more challenging, and I\u2019m no longer the best due to my competition, but the Me from before would have taken on each assignment and extra credit like a fire and gotten with it done on the same day it was assigned, even if there was a week given to complete, I would do it instantly. I was a workaholic, and genuinely enjoyed the workloads, like it was pleasurable to constantly be working on something. Now, even if I know I could get it done if I truly tried, I just don\u2019t seem to have it in me anymore. I may just sit there on the bed, staring at the wall and spacing off as I hear my older sister lecturing my younger one outside, both of them making too much darn noise.\n\nNow, in a school setting, I subconsciously don\u2019t want others to see me as slacking off, this forces me to focus better, it\u2019s still almost as if I was \u201cperforming\u201d for someone else. I always feel that way in public, or I act in such a way that every small movement is planned, like I\u2019m performing, but it isn\u2019t exactly comfortable and I just want to get away and be by myself to not keep doing that.\n\nThis is a retouch of previous posts I have, but I just need new perspectives on things, something that forces me to dig deeper with a purpose of getting something specific out that is relwvant to finding out my type.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "So this isn't necessarily a \"type me\" post as this will just add to my confusion, but if you'd like to do so, then I suppose. This is moreso a \"What functions does it sound like I use?\" type of post? It's also worth noting that I'm a 30F, so I understand that some of the functions \"wake up\" later than others. \n\nSo I've been trying to find a good functional stack that fits me based on my understanding of MBTI functions as well as my base understanding of myself. Its worth noting that for some odd reason, the way I see myself doesn't seem to be the way others see me:\n\n- I find myself to be a sensitive individual, but when I ask others do they see this, they say \"I can't see it\" or \"I'm shocked that you are like this, I never would have guessed\". My boyfriend of 5\u00bd years even seems to think I'm more methodical and calculating vs sensitive, but I feel it within me. I guess the feeling doesn't match what others see though. My Mom is the only person that knows that I've been sensitive since I was really young. \n\n- Speaking of \"methodical and calculating\", I personally didn't notice this until my later 20s, but my Mom states that I've always been like this, and looking back, I guess it was always automatic. I was always looking for data to collect, someone to analyze, always drawing conclusions based on data that has been presented to me, always trying to find a way to sift through my brain how the information makes sense, etc etc. \n\n- One thing that I also did notice is that my ability to have a \"world view/overview/big picture\" approach to information has always been there. I've always been a futuristic individual. When I focus on the past, I scorn at it, because it doesn't hold many good memories for me, so I'm instinctively drawn to the future. My boyfriend says that I always have to be \"3 steps ahead of someone\" and I think \"too far in to the future\", which messes things up. Multiple therapists have told me that I can interconnect stuff fast and my brain moves a little too fast and I need to slow down. No matter how much I try, I can't. \ud83d\ude43 I see the deep obvious that I thought others could see, but apparently it seems that people can't. \n\n- I can manage stressful situations, a little too well. I don't crack under pressure easily, and my one therapist said that in order for me to deal with jokes, I tend to laugh/poke fun at it. Of course this is a cover up....but sometimes I feel that I overreact to stuff that isn't a big deal to others and the stuff that I SHOULD overreact to, I underreact to it. \n\n- Ironically, as much as I know that I'm sensitive, I can't stand others knowing cause it makes me feel weak or something, but these days, I've been working on not being so cold (not on purpose) to other people. I've been told numerous times that I give off \"unapproachable energy\", but others tell me that I'm nice, so it all depends I guess? \n\n- My boyfriend and friend tells me that I \"see multiple points of view\" too much instead of just \"picking a side\". I can't help it. Just how my brain works. \n\n- When I'm hungry, I can feel my stomach growl, but I can ignore it for hours and hours on end. Sometimes I don't eat cause I simply don't feel like it cause chewing is too much work. Sometimes I only eat once a day because of this. I can also feel sensations in my body, but again, I can largely ignore them cause I don't feel like dealing with stuff. \ud83e\udd72\n\n- I know that I'm addicted to knowledge and learning and I also know that I prioritize learning and intellect more than anything else. I have my theories for the reason why this is, but again, I value others opinions. My boyfriend states that I'm too logical for my own good, but again, I don't agree. I try to be nicer to other people cause in the end, I fear that if I'm my real self (blunt, but not mean), people won't really tolerate that too well, like they have done in the past when I've done this automatically. I would think that I was giving some insightful advice, when in the end, I would just hurt someone's feelings. \n\nTL;DR: I need some help at the very least finding out which functions I use. I know that online tests aren't reliable and I also know that I overanalyze way too much to come to a firm conclusion. I've mulled this over time and time again and I just would like to know.", "clean_guess": "INTJ", "llm_guess": " INTJ", "logprobs": []}

I really valued having an organized environment for example whenever my friends had sleepovers I would force them to clean up because they messed up my room most of the time and I put a lot of work into making sure my room looked neat and tidy and other than that it wasn't my mess to deal with so they needed to clean it up. I was very logical when I was in middle school, I often looked down on other people my age viewing them as stupid/immature and I was introverted anyways so having to go to school with gross un organized monsters was pretty tough.

In the enneagram, I'm pretty sure I'm 4w3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What motivates you?**\n\nI've found that two things motivate me: Doing things that I enjoy and doing things that are for the greater good.\n\nMy concept of fun mostly excludes the senses and involves exploring things (80% online and 20% in the real world), taking on challenges, researching a new thing or figuring out how to implement an idea. But I generally get bored, especially with repetitive things, which has led to me having almost no hard skills, but at least I've a broad knowledge (not deep, but broad) in many areas and am very creative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do things for the greater good because I want to be fair and help the people I care about. I feel a high level of empathy for others and want to see justice done, but I feel so weak right now and am unable to make significant changes in the world. I do my best to help where I can, especially the group of people I care about. But I also feel kind of dependent on people's approval, acceptance and love for who I'm, so that probably influences why I care so much about doing good for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My dream?**\n\nPeople think I should go into science, but I don't want that. I want to help people directly, run an NGO or get involved in politics. I also like the idea of taking on a leadership role, the applause, being super important and inspiring lots of people. I also want to shape the world according to my will and be more aligned with what I wanted: a fairer and freer world.\n\nSpeaking a little more abstractly: I also dream of ultimate freedom. To no longer be controlled by others, to be who I'm without shame and the freedom to do whatever I want. And if my plan comes true, I'll achieve this ideal state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My fear?**\n\nLosing my love for everyone or discovering that everyone is lying to me and hating me behind my back. The idea of being a nobody in the future scares me too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Behaivor:**\n\nI'm generally an introvert who becomes more outgoing when talking to people I like. But I'm not shy, I'm very good at oratory and persuasion, but I get shy if I think it'll be annoying to the other person. I'm generally caring, helpful, warm-hearted and respectful when dealing with people. But I've problems with leading people, am either a bit authoritarian or a bit pushy because I praise harmony in groups. But when I'm not working with others, I'm confident and say what I feel. I generally feel a lot of emotions, but I don't take my anger out on others, but when I feel bad, I become very needy and attention seeking. I generally notice things that others don't (e.g. connections between different subjects), but I don't notice things that others notice (very obvious details, e.g. something that stands out in the picture). A good quality of mine is that I'm responsible and always do what I promise: even if it's at the expense of my pleasure. I also tend to be very idealistic in the sense that I've ideas of how things will go and how people will react (a person who likes to party won't go out with me etc). For finishing this, I think I've a good sense of humor and laugh with everything. I even joke alone about situations and sometimes the need to say the thing is more important than anything to me.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hi fellow personality nerds! \n\nI am a 28 year old European man. I will use the template provided in the pinned post as a starting point to describe myself. \n\nI am unsure if Im ENFP or INFP, my friends say im a equal mix. Also unsure about my Enneagram, tho I get typed 4w3 now (it was 7w8 in the past).\n\nI discovered MBTI when I was around 19. I always got INFP. Due to where I grew up I was pretty isolated, due to the lack of likeminded people and a difficult upbringing. I moved to another place when I was 21. Here I was surrounded by intresting creative people that I found very relatable, felt like I was in Heaven. Problem was that I havent developed my social skills, and  felt awkward talking to new people at a party, even if I wanted to. \n\nI started saying the affirmation \"I am a confident Extrovert\" to myself in the mirror every morning for a month. And gues what, i got typed as ENFP 7w8, sometimes ESFP (tho im definitely not a sensor). I became the life of the party and was pretty popular and succesful in my music and art in this city. Made a lot of friends, and some really deep friendships that I still maintain regularly today.\n\n1,5 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD (ADD). I have been doing my prescribed stimulants on a weekly basis since then. To be honest it was really nice in the start (Vyvanse), but now after a year on them it has made me much more reserved, more serious and less funny. After a year on the meds I always type as INFP 4w3 instead of ENFP 7w8. If i do a moderate dose of the meds I loose my desire to connect with people and my creativity get flattened. My brain is often so blank under the influence that I dont know what say or create. Starting a task is super easy tho, but its often the wrong task. I feel fine but not happy. Therefore I only pop ADHD pills a couple of times to do the boring tasks that dont require creativity. I also moved to Berlin a couple of months ago, but the social isolation started a bit beforehand.\n\nMy upbringing was mostly difficult. Was raised alone by a single mother and was totally neglected by my dad. My best friend turned out to be a psychopath and got me bullied a lot. Included physical violence, and I was constantly in fear. My teenage years was absolutely horrible. Just started theraphy for it. \n\nI have worked as a freelance musician/mix engineer while doing side jobs like working in a sauna or in kindergarten. Moved to Berlin 2 months ago to study sound engineering for a year. \n\nIf I would spend the weekend alone I most likely would feel a bit lonely. But if Im seeing someone lets say on monday ill be fine. I might call a friend for an hour and it would brighten my mood. Several times this year i have gone a week + pretty much without interacting with people (on the meds). I end up feeling hollow and empty.\n\nI like to meditate, journal, to go to the gym or run in the forest, I like to make music, to paint and I like a good party. Recently started reading books. Im very into art, clothes and photography. \n\nId say im very curious. My brain often makes a music video in my head all by itself if im going for a walk. \n\nIll take leadership if its related to a show im playing or an art project. But at a school/work situation im usually pretty passive and dont force my opinions on others. My friends describe me more of an inspierer, rather than me telling people what to do.\n\nNot so coordinated, as a musician and artist im more intrested in making things on the computer or simple things with pen. Im not intrested in perfecting technique a lot or being a virtuoso. As a musician im more intrested in producing/composing using abstract and otherwordly sounds, rather than playing things live or jamming with instruments.\n\nI think its only the here and now. Past and present is just concepts in our imagination, its always now ofcorse. I think a lot. People say that i seem to be in my thoughts a lot. Im more happy when im not tho. Meditation is good for me but after 10 years it has become a bit boring so Im looking for something else, maybe yoga.\n\nIll like to help if I can. Im a extreme people pleaser tho so Im working on that.\n\nIm always on a battle between creating a new rutine and then be like f\\*ck this. I always make a weekly plan that is very structured but only follow trough on half of it. I suppose I might go against my natural spontaneous flow.\n\nEfficiency and productivity is important if its things I care about. But it can be toxic to me, leading me to be a over achiver and focus on the wrong things. Therefore I focus more now on having just a few long term goals that are meaningfull to me and living in the moment.\n\nI control others with my people pleasing. Im practicing to stop this.\n\nLearning style is more audatory. Helps if im with someone else that is structured. I use the site focusmate a lot for co-working.\n\nI break projects into small managable tasks, but end up throwing it away because something unexpected happened. Im better at going with the flow ive learned.\n\nI want to create something deeply beautiful and original and touch thousands of peoples hearts. Art and music has been some of my biggest gifts in this world and I want to give back to the world and leave my unique imprint before I die. I also want to heal my trauma and have inner peace. Be totally in control of myself and live in the moment.\n\nIm afraid to grow old stuck in a 9/5 i dont like. To be addicted to drugs and have shallow relationships and not create anything beautiful. To be stuck in short term pleasure and waste my potential. \n\nThe highs in my life are when im traveling around playing or creating music and art and I have influence on the world. When I get out of my head and live in the moment. When Im at a place with people where i feel like I belong.\n\nThe lows in my life is self-isolation, addiction to weed and masturbation, overthinking, just following immediate pleasures instead of coing out of my comfort zone to find meaning.\n\nI daydream a lot yes and imagine a lot in my inner world. But for lifes big events and to the things that matters im very grounded in reality. People have told me I am able to have a foot in reality while being a dreamer at the same time. People often say to me that I seem very happy, and have asked me about whats the secret. Tho I can be. very happy It is often people pleasing to be so. I isolate when im down. Practicing to be more transparent tho. What I often struggle with is the small tasks of real life; being on time, blowing out the candle when I leave a room, doing the dishes etc.\n\n\"Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\" Answer: I would do mindfulness. Just observe my thoghts as they come and go without trying to change and/or controll them. Thoughts would come and go tho, and its mostly daily life stuff, or insights on what direction to take my life.\n\nI can be super indecisive , it can take a long time. Its beacause of my upringing. If i didnt please people in my life it would result in bullying or voilence. Therefore I always take everyones opinion into concideration. Its just part of my trauma, im working on this atm.\n\nIt can take a bit of time to process my emotions. If someone asks me \"do you wanna do this on sunday\", I often need some time to think about it preferably alone to come to a conclusion. Its also a part of people pleasing so Im practicing saying \"ill think about it\". I can people please alot. Suggesting to other people to do something because i think they would like it, then it turns out nether of us dont want. \n\nI dont mind breaking rules if it dosent go against my moral compass. I question all rules and dont feel bad at all for breaking them if no one is hurt and I dont go against my values.\n\nDo you think im ENFP or INFP? And enneagram 7w8, 4w3 or 4w5? \n\nThanks for reading, have a great life dudes<3", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n37 years of age and male. I am relatively effeminate for a male, and I never felt like I fit in most male dominated circles. I am generally optimistic and happy go lucky. I have a very sharp wit and love to shock people with some of the things I say. My partner often expresses how amazed they are at how my mind works and how I remember things. I am a metalhead and quite nerdy. I wear kilts and am relatively well known for being the \"kilt guy\". I don't wear kilts for cultural reasons or anything like that. I simply like them for their practicality and I like that they are a bit genderfluid. \n\n\u2022Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD, and I honestly dislike having it and sometimes find it very hard to live life. The emotional dysregulation aspect sucks because I can come off as being very cold and ruthless. The scattered attention and disruptive behavior is also problematic at times. Generally, I am happy go lucky and enjoy entertaining people with my random behavior.\n\n\u2022Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nMy upbringing was poor. I was bullied a lot and often escaped the reality of my life through fantastical playacting and getting lost in books and comics. I wasn't raised in a religious household and I am not particularly into religion. I think Atheistic Satanism and Buddhism are appealing. I dislike organized religion to the point where I will argue with people who try to hand me pamphlets or ask me if I know their sky daddy.

As for work, all you need to know is that it's an office job.\n\nApparently I am an ESTP but I want to know for sure since I don't think I fit the impulsive and disregard of things related to the type. I have a very surface level understanding of it.\n\n**How I perceive myself:**\n\nI am goal-oriented and I want to achieve my goals as fast as possible while being methodical, \"to keep fueling the train\" so to speak. If there are obstacles, I will face them head-on. I can get distracted at times but I always pull myself back to focusing. \n\nI also plan for the long-term but I don't mind doing short-term alongside it. I am independent and I pride myself in that. In regards to my background, my mother is a nurse and my father is a factory worker, I have social circles that I interact with, otherwise a humble background.\n\nI like parties and huge gatherings, e.g. festivals and alongside it I can have a law breaking streak if I want to spice my night up. Bible studies and book clubs is not something that interests me.\n\nIn school I was interested in geography and history and I liked doing public speeches about topics while adding my own opinion to it as well, I remember my teacher saying that I have an \"alter ego\" when I did and I received praise.\n\nI get restless when I am not working towards my goals and I get right back to it a couple of days later even if people tell me to take a break.\n\nI am ambitious and I like taking calculated risks. I dislike it when people take their time to decide things when I can sort of know the good decision already after analyzing the circumstance quickly. I get disappointed when the \"train\" has already passed and if I took the decision then we would be on the bandwagon and not left behind. But I don't disparage them for it unless they were snarky, there's always another time.\n\nI have structures and \"ways to do\" things in my mind already and I have suggested ideas before that got rejected due to them being \"strict\". The ideas get implemented anyway months later by someone else, I find it good. I like to work in big groups, especially if I can move myself up in the hierarchy.\n\nI like prestige so someone else taking my ideas without mentioning me is not something I personally agree with and I do bring it up. I am also aware of networking and creating connections and seeing those relationships grow up from a seed to a tree though I only network with people that I find relevant to what I need and what I can offer them and how far we can go.\n\nI am also aware of how systems work and how hierarchies function, I dislike it when some try to make it horizontal or \"muddy\" it so it's hard to make out who is above and who is below. I also like to play around with systems and innovate to make them more effective or to find vulnerabilities that need to be fixed, I do implement them on my own accord or I suggest the changes as an idea and I also present reasons.\n\nI am inclined to do the small things out of courtesy, like holding the door open or helping someone carry a heavy package, taking off my glove before shaking their hand type of things but otherwise I am not so inclined to go up and ask them if they need help unless I want to specifically get to know them. I am also aware how I appear to others when I am friendly.\n\n**How others perceive me:**\n\nI have been told that I am the following: Well-mannered, polite, a \"gentleman\", outgoing, ambitious, hard worker, creative, logical, attractive, \"always ready\". I have also been told by my managers that I have potential. As for creative, it's not in the artsy type of way, it's in a technical way.\n\nAs for the negatives, I have been told that I can be \"raw\", insensitive and at times I can have an \"angry\" resting face.

{"submission": "I've taken the test a few times over the past few years, and I always get ENTJ. However, I don't really relate to a lot of ENTJs, possibly due to vastly different life experiences.

{"submission": "# Introduction\n\nHello! I've been through quite the journey the past year typology wise, I'm going to detail that journey during this section. Feel free to skip this part if you don't really care. I was 13 when I first took the 16personalities test, I got an ENTP result. Shrugging it off I went on with my life, it wasn't till 3 years later at age 16 I got into MBTI properly. I redid the 16personalities test and got ENTP again.\n\nI've struggled with ADHD and recently got medicated at age 20. I was very energetic and struggled to sit still and pay attention, which of course led me to reinforce the belief that I was ENTP. It wasn't till three years later where I started to have my doubts within the type. I'm very stability oriented, I don't like chaos, I don't really have much of a need for novelty abstract or otherwise, often it exhausts me to an extent (I do still consider myself to be a medium curious person). I was typed ESTJ by one of my close friends after a while, and honestly for a while it made sense despite the stereotypes not fitting me whatsoever. I'm generally polite and very okay with letting people do their own thing as long they don't intrude on my things.\n\nFast-forward to now, I struggle to evaluate myself considering my ADHD issues. Inferior Fi seems a bit low for me, I definitely worry and care about my personal identity and while I used to believe I didn't care much about values, that is definitely not the case anymore. So here's some information about me and hopefully you guys can pitch in.\n\n# ISTJ, ESTJ, or neither?\n\nI was unsure whether to write this as an organic text or bullet point list. I settled on bullet points though for ease of reading. Some points may be long, but I'd like to give as much information as possible\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I enjoy discussing philosophy and morality, exchanging worldviews with others. I find these talks to be incredibly stimulating and entertaining.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I am a couch-potato, I don't like going outside to party or participate in an event. I have my own hobbies (writing, typology, gaming, philosophy) that I prefer spending my time with. I have attended parties and I'm often invited, but I just don't derive much joy from them so I often decline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 'I am very skeptical and believe every claim should have proof to back it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I enjoy thinking about who I am as a person and trying to evaluate myself objectively, but often struggle, believing myself to be biased to a certain extent. I often consume fiction, when I do my favorite characters often end up being ones that I see parts of myself in. I am glad I wasn't a teen during the sigma male culture wave, 14 year old me would've eaten it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Duty is something I value very highly, despite not always fulfilling it, I see it as an ideal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I am quick to dismiss things as nonsensical and stupid but if someone shows enough persistence I can often warm up to it provided proper reasoning or evidence is given\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When proven wrong I often have a noticeable reaction. Most of the time this is just getting sad or disappointed, other times it manifests as frustration that I was wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* In private with people I am really close with I become energetic as well as goofy, publicly though one might not expect this considering my usually quiet and serious demeanor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I will frequently look back at my past and assert meaning to it, for example, I grew up pretty neglected by my parents, they would also drink quite often. I'll often observe present day behaviors and often connect them back to certain things in my past that could've resulted in me having those predispositions. These connections are very subconscious and just sorta happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I value responsibility but struggle with it myself. I can procrastinate on projects quite often and I struggle managing daily tasks. it's gotten better after ADHD medication but I certainly still struggle with it. My parents didn't really take much time to teach me discipline or discourage skipping out on homework, so this most definitely had an effect. I've dedicated most of my late teens till now to fixing this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I will always try to do things the same way if I have the chance, even in \"fun\" activities such as gaming. I do not like experimentation and prefer to focus on doing things one way and improving that method to become better and better. I am quite perfectionistic in my writing and often feel paralyzed by the fear that it might not be good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I'm very anxious with ambiguity, preferring having all the answers immediately. I often get impatient when someone is being vague or withholding information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* While I don't consider myself to be very inventive or original, I can get really excited at the prospect of an idea I have, often indulging them for a while until I event", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": " ISTJ", "logprobs": []}

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\ni'm 17 years old (okay, i ackshually turn 17 in 2 days, whatever), genderfluid but for the sake of the post we'll say non-binary. i've been described as a \"chill\" person but idk if i agree? there are just a lot of things that i don't care about, but also plenty that i care about a lot. i feel like i tend to be the person watching my friends do some stupid shit and telling them not to. i also tend to just shut up if i feel an argument coming on, which i guess could seem like i don't care even if i do a lot? \ni've also been told i was intimidating to many people before they got to know me. i don't really understand why this is, maybe i've got rbf? or i just tend to have a vibe of \"nobody talk to me or percieve me\" sometimes\n\n\u2022\t  Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\ni don't have any diagnoses but i strongly suspect that i have some kind of anxiety and it affects my life. i also think i may have some symptoms of adhd and/or autism. i'm collecting A's\n\n\u2022\t  Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nmy parents are vaguely christian, but it was never really a theme in my life. i was never forced to go to church or read the bible or anything like that. i'm very against organized religion and people using their religion to be hateful, but i don't mind religion and religious people as a whole concept. i think it's cool that people can find hope and community through religion. i personally am agnostic and don't really see any proof as to there being or not being a god. \n\n\u2022\t  What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\ni work as a cook for a popular pizza chain, and it's just OK. it's had its ups and downs, and i somewhat like the repetitive nature of such a job so i can think about other things simultaneously, as well as having a task to do without any questions or open-endedness. however, i'm looking into getting a new job so i can try something new and also leave that honestly pretty terrible establishment, or at least that specific location. i also just think food service is not for me because i'm a bit too anxious about food safety, and i think everything i do might make the customers ill.\n\n\u2022\t  If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\ni oftentimes really want to be alone, especially if i'm in a bad mood, but i need the option of talking to people to still be there even if i don't take it? i also tend to be nervous to be on my own since i don't feel properly prepared to defend myself/the house if something happens. i also still want to be able to text people\n\n\u2022  \tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\ni'm pretty bad at sports and don't really take much interest in them. i have taken slight interest in playing tennis but i'm not serious about it. i also don't get any enjoyment out of watching sports, but i can kind of see why other people do?\ni like going outside in nature in theory, but sometimes sensory experiences like temperature, wind, sounds, etc. bother me too much in some cases.\n\n\u2022\t  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\ni think i'm very curious, in a way where i have a really weird google search history i don't think i can show people. i tend to get curious about concrete things that i can already find the answer to fairly easily, though. \ni feel like i have the desire to be creative but not the originality. i don't know how people just create complex ideas from nothing at all. my ideas for characters and such tend to come from other places such as song lyrics.\n\n\u2022\t  Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\ni don't like the pressure of being a leader but i also naturally end up being a bit controlling, if that makes any sense? sometimes i have a clear view of what i want something to be like and can't fully grasp other peoples' ideas. it is a flaw of mine but not one that comes up enough for me to be completely aware.\n\n\u2022\t  Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\ni don't consider myself to be very coordinated when it comes to things like dancing, sports, or any sort of moving my whole body. i'm a little more coordinated with art, though i still kind of tend to struggle through it sometimes and don't get what i want on the page the first time.\n\n\u2022\t  Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\ni consider myself to be somewhat artistic. i don't tend to say im a \"creative\" person because i feel like its unfair to artists who are more original and unique? as i said before, a lot of my ideas tend to be derived from other things around me, such as music or others' art. this isn't to say i copy them, but i draw a lot of inspiration.\n\n\n(continued in comments)", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "\\- Hii, well, first of all, english is not my primary language, so if there's any grammar mistake, I'm sorry. Im 18 years old and I am a girl. I like to talk a lot with people I feel comfortable, however, if I feel like the people around me wont like me, I tend to be very shy and speak as less as possible. I tend to act dumb with the people around me, since I have already figured out that people like me more when I act like that. Deep down, I know when someone doesnt actually likes me, or what they think of me, and I dont know why, but I like to pretend as if I dont notice. I tend to like people very quickly, and once they leave, I feel very sad, however, I quickly forget about them and get new friends.\n\n\\- I was raised as a catholic, but I dont follow that religion anymore, however, I think I still believe in god, probably because Im scared that afterlife doesnt actually exists.\n\n\\- Also, I study medicine, however, I hate it, I hate my career, I wanted to be an actress, however, I keep studying medicine because I cant stand the possibility that other girls from my school who were less intelligent than me will end up becoming doctors and I wont, so I keep studying that career.\n\n\\- I would like to spend a whole weekend by myself, in fact, I would like to live all by myself forever, however, I know I will start to miss contact with other people. Not specific people, but to interact with other human beings. However, I can live without it. Sometimes, I would like to spend time alone, I would love if they leave me alone, however, theres always someone who comes and makes me company, or I end up looking for company, but once I start to spend time with someone, I wanna be alone, again.\n\n\\- My favorite activities are to read novels, but specially classic novels. I also like excercising, but just running, since I use headphones while running, and I can think about my interests while Im running, like I can forget about everything else. Apart from that, I like watching series, and sometimes when I'm bored I write in my notes about how I feel about certain things (lol).\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\- I'm a very curious person, but just about other people problems, actually (lol). I'm not interested in how something works or technical things, I'm more interested in how the relationships that exist in the world work, I'm vey vurious about gossip. My ideas are like, for example, one day, suddenly the idea of certain topic comes to my mind and the I keep thinking about that for certain moments of my day.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- I dont like being a leader, I rather listen other people ideas, however, if I dont like them, I may tell them, but I almst alwaiys end up doing what others want or expect from me. I only take the role of leader when everything seems out of control and I start to get stressed, so I decide to tell everyone else what to do, however, when doing that, I may seem rude or bossy.\n\n\\- I'm not a very coordinated person, I usually get stressed because of that.\n\n\\- I'm not a very artistic person, however, I can entertain myself when I go to a museum by admiring that paintings, I like to imagine how those paintings were made, and what happened to the people that was painted. Also, when looking to a photograph, I like to imagine the lives of everyone outside of the picture (I dont know if that makes sense lol) .\n\n\\- About the past, present and future, Im scared of all of them. Since I was a girl I've always liked to, once I finish my time with someone, just forget about it. FOr example, when I changed schools, I usually ended up ghosting everyone I met ther, because I wanted to start from zero, and because I was scared that the people that I left wouldnt like me to stay around since my moments with them were already in the past. However, when I find my present being similar to my past, I try to do the opposite to what I did before, since I'm scared of repeating the same. I think that, even though the past may be awful, it really helps us to learn. About the present, I think that it is important to be aware of it, so you can have a better future. I usually tend to make my not important choices based on my present. About the future, it is something that actually scares me. However, I like to imagine how I will be in the future, and I tend to plan things in the long term. However, even though I like to think a lot about my future, I have realized that I dont act too much in order to change it, since I believe a lot in destiny. However, I like a lot to imagine, for example, when I meet someone, if I will still be friends with that person in the future or not. Or for example, when starting a project, I have already decided if I would end that project, or if I will abandon it in the future. \n\n\\- Finally, when meeting somene new, I try to act friendly if that person seems to like me, however, if it is someone that doesnt seem to want to be friends with me, I decide to not speak to them at all, or speak as less as possible and be serious, pretending to be serious, since I dont want their rejection, I tend to act as if I dont care about them, even though deep down I'm scared.  \n\n\nanyways, based on what I just wrote (as I write this I'm scared that I may have sounded like a shitty person, Im promise I'm not that bad lol), could you type me please?

I wake up at 6am, make my bed, workout, clean the house and then myself until 6:15 After that and after reading the schedule of the day enough time to remember it, I make some deep work (4-6 hours). Then I take my brain off by listening to some podcasts or reading to give my brain new ideas before I do another set of deep work. I then like to go on a walk with a friend to grab a bite and talk about the project we have together. Then I go home reading for a bit, prepare the next day and go to bed.

Never really warmed up to the concepts, tried to make it happen for me, but eventually I left the church at 18. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nOrthodontist. I chose dentistry for job stability. I don't like it, but I don't hate it either. It does give me a lot of anxiety because of possible negative treatment outcome. \n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nRefreshed. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI suck at sports big time. The only sports i'm vaguely good at are the solo ones like gymnastics and running. I don't enjoy leaving the house, I'd rather sit at home and do nothing tbh. \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious. I read a lot about a lot of different topics. I think I like reading the most about either human psychology and psysiology and nature. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI was more enthusiastic about it when I was younger, but quickly realised I don't have what it takes and I let other people take the lead. \nI'm too disorganised for it.\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI feel like i'm pretty clumsy, but I can get better at things with practice.

If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nYes, I used to write fanfiction(but not anymore due to lack of inspiration.) I do enjoy watching arthouse movies tho and interpreting them. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI don't care about the past that much(used to care about it more as a kid when I tried to find why I am the way that I am) Atm I feel like I've dissected it enough, and am more future oriented. \n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI usually help if it's in my capabilities.I find it hard to say no if I know that it's something i can do. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n Yessss. Very important. \n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nEh, I wish I cared more about it, but I don't. I feel I'd have way more money if I did. \n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI try not to, I might have done it when I was younger tho. I try to be a solo flier these days and stay in my lane. Life is hard enough already. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\nBrowsing the internet mostly. Because of the vast amount of knowledge at my disposal haha\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI really don't know, but I feel I suck at rote memorization. i've used Anki cards lately and they helped me a lot. Spaced repetition works for everyone I think. \n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nIt depends. If it's something VERY important I tend to strategise, if it's something that I deem not that relevant I tend to improvise as I go. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally, I want to be a half-decent doctor and maybe also write on the side. Personally, I want to have a decent home and live a comfortable life with my husband. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nWhat I fear the most is fucking up a pacient's life. I don't think I 'hate' anything per se. Maybe life itself? I feel like it's a raw deal overall. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\nI feel like I'm at my best when I'm appreciated in the workplace and personal life and when I have a cohesive group of friends. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nWhen I'm at my lowest I'm completely isolated and lose myself in video games and fiction and completely ignore everything elsie just to cope with being alive.\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream, but I feel I never really lose touch with reality. \n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nUsually I panick about how my patients are going. If not, I think about my latest hiperfixation. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt depends, but usually pretty quickly. I do change my mind quite often tho, sadly. There's always some info I've missed. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nImportant, I think about why I feel the way I feel a lot and try to regulate it somehow. They're pretty important, I guess\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes, if it's not something I care about or am sure about. If I am really sure about something, I tend to be quite opinionated.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't break rules that often, I think they're there for a reason(at least in my work field). Otherwise, when it doesn't involve objective information, I don't care that much about rules. Authority should be challenged if nonsensical.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": " Before I start, apologies if I am not concise. I am sleep deprived. This is also very long, as it is approximately 2050 words.\n\nSo firstly I'll note that I think I'm more likely a -P type, but I'm open to the possibility that I'm actually a -J type. I also don't know my enneagram. I have done research (for nearly a year) about MBTI and the functions/functional stack to figure out what I am exactly, with not much luck. So I need help.\n\nSocially, I'm not sure if I'm an introvert or an extrovert. But I tend to feel quite happy being isolated, for a limited period of time though. When I do socialize, I can gain energy if my company is made up of friends I trust. But I do require alone time. I guess this, socially, shows me to be more of an introvert.\n\nBut then I also tend to be more assertive, rather than laying back. I'm not usually afraid of approaching people if I want to meet them (except for when they are intimidating), and in a group, I tend to organize the social events. Project wise, I may organize what people are doing as well, if necessary. However, in a group if there is someone willing to take \"the wheel\", then I'll be happy to give it to them. Even though I lean towards being assertive, I'm actually not very assertive. But I do dislike being controlled, unless it is work related and necessary in my eyes (I guess that would be called being managed though).\n\nNow another thing is that I am impulsive. I, by nature, tend to act before I think (I am working on that in myself though). To some, I probably look like a clown or a fool, by how I speak or act sometimes. I suppose this is due to me being unafraid of self expression (and being a strange person). But then again, I tend to act before I think, and therefore I sometimes say foolish things.\n\nHowever, I also want to note that I am always thinking, and I find it impossible not to. And I do tend to talk before I think, because my wit is slow and conversations are usually fast, so if I want to be involved in a conversation, I end up saying what first comes to mind, which can be something stupid.\n\nI am generally a chaos lover. But to a degree. I do love the unfamiliar and new, I love being spontaneous (and confusing others that way), and I find jumping into doing things that have an unknown fate quite exhilarating. I also like disrupting the status quo, and I don't care for following trends, even if my friends are following it. And I would bend the rules all the time.\n\nBut why I say to a degree is because I also love structure. I enjoy organizing things, planning, and creating structure. I usually have a daily plan and checklist, I plan for events and things ahead of time, and I like to know what my future would look like, and plan for it. I constantly create expectations for things. I quite dislike events happening quite spontaneously and suddenly, and I like to know about them ahead of time. However, I don't mind changing the course of things, as long as it's calculated.\n\nAgain, about how I am socially. I rarely ever have had a lot of friends in my life, as I prefer to have just a few friendships, but deep, meaningful friendships. I prefer directness too, and here's why. Firstly, obviously honesty is great, but secondly, I am quite insensitive and not attuned to how people feel. So I may go \"too far\" without knowing it, unless I'm told. I also feel stressed when I have to deal with people's emotions, and I don't know how to act when someone is crying, so if possible I'll let someone else deal with them. Or if not, I'll sit there and maybe pat their back if they say that's what's comforting for them. \n\nAlong the lines of directness, I did say I like it. I like the truth, no matter how harsh it is, and I'll seek it. If I feel like someone is lying to me or beating around the bush, I will try to pry the truth out of them. And also due to me loving the truth, I am quite blunt myself. But I sometimes hurt certain people's feelings in the process by being so. I did say I am insensitive.\n\nAs I may have indicated before, I love research, and exploring. If I want to find something out, I don't mind taking time to try to find out. And with exploring, I mentioned I love new things, and so I'll constantly be on the lookout for something new and unfamiliar, so I can discover it. I love learning how things work, and how the world works. \n\nMy conversations with people also are commonly along the lines of that: discussing thoughts and ideas. Sometimes I will debate too, to understand other people's ways of thinking. I ask many, many questions too. Which to the point is irritating for some at times. If I am trying to figure out an issue or something someone is trying to work out and needs assistance, I will get very irritated if they won't answer my relevant questions though. Even more irritating when they say something else that is not helpful in the moment.\n\nConversations I don't prefer too often are things like showing me something allegedly cute, funny or cool, and commenting on how cute/funny/cool it is. It can be nice to occasionally see something cute, funny or cool, and have light-hearted conversation, but if it is a frequent conversation topic or the conversation goes on for too long, I'll get bored.\n\nAlso, when I talk, I tend to address myself and my experiences alot, as that is what I know. I struggle to communicate otherwise.\n\nI am a very creative person, and people have said so too, so I'm sure of it. I love to imagine, and think of stories or art (art, in a very broad sense). I'm also said to be intellectual. And yeah, I love to think, analyze, and ponder. And I love to be intellectually challenged.\n\nMusic, I need all the time. I have a theme song for everything and every moment of my life. If I'm not listening to music, I'll have music playing in my head. I'll get stressed if I have no music. \n\nI love dancing. When I'm alone, I'll dance like a lunatic. But even in public if I'm feeling good, I'll dance, but not as wildly as in private.\n\nAnd I'm sure I look like a lunatic to others. In fact I also talk to myself. But I do that because it's easier to think that way. But due to potential private thoughts slipping out, I instead have started journaling as well.\n\nI have indicated that I like the new. And I like change. My interests are constantly changing, I think I constantly change as a person, and I look for opportunities to change as a person. In the aspect of growth. Because I want to become a better version of myself, and I want to be a good person in general.\n\nI think I have a pretty big ego or what not. I love who I am. I also am not afraid of saying what I believe I am good at, and my strengths. It feels very affirming, and I'll also be just telling about myself. About my qualities though, I usually will verify what they are from people I know though. It's hard to know if something is true without secondary sources after all. But even though I love who I am, I irritate myself too. It is commonly due to my slow wit, impulsivity, and distractedness.\n\nI am somewhat open about myself. I like to make it clear to people who I am from the first meeting, which is helpful because I don't want to socialize with people that I have nothing in common with. But I do end up being around those people anyways because I appear nice?? somehow. I suppose I can be nice somehow, even though I'm not the most considerate. But where I am, politeness is the language everyone has to speak, so I adopted it. Anyways, I dislike hurting people's feelings by saying that I am not their friend, if they have done nothing wrong, that is. So instead, I tend to ghost them (bad, I know. I don't know what else to do.) And to what degree depends on how much I tolerate them. \n\nSome things I keep private though. Really personal experiences and things I am insecure about. Things people can exploit.\n\nI am said to have my head in the clouds. I am not a present person, and I would most frequently think about the future, not the moment, and not frequently the past (anymore). I also am not attuned to my own emotional health, and the only way I find out how I am is by analyzing my recent dreams and my behavioral patterns.\n\nHow I dress is usually quite fancily, unless I am staying at home. And I already said that I don't care how strange or unconventional I look. I'll wear 19th century casual wear sometimes, and some other times I'll wear hippie fashion. Or if I'm out of time I'll just wear a turtleneck (or shirt if it'll be warm), jeans, and one of my double breasted winter coats, for if it gets cold. I prefer to wear dark or completely black clothes. People have said that I normally dress quite smart.\n\nOn makeup and hair, I'll try to make my hair look well and suitable to my general style, but I still experiment with it a lot, due to my lack of experience in hair styling. And makeup I'll occasionally wear, but not often. When I do, I like to put a bit of eyeliner on, and make my face shape appear sharper.\n\nI have some daily routines, like washing my face with ice cold water as soon as I wake up, and setting my bed. But I am still working on creating daily routines, and my general health. I try to go to the gym a few times a week, but I may miss some days, due to them being hectic, or me having a headache. I do not have a skincare routine, except for washing my face daily. All the routines I have are fairly new, and I am trying to create more new ones. I used to be completely spontaneous. \n\nI recently have noticed that I like doing things and having a full day of things to do. But despite that, I still struggle with getting myself to start doing something.\n\nI get distracted easily. I can quickly go on a tangent, and veer conversations off topic. I struggle to commit to one project, and I have endless unfinished projects. I say I will complete them at some point, and I do pick up where I left off when I return to them, but I rarely ever actually finish them, due to how distracted I am by everything. However, when I do become focused, I achieve quite a lot.\n\nI have indicated that I may be a thrill seeker, which I am. I'll do wild, crazy things, for an adrenaline rush, but in regulation nowadays. Instead I go on runs for it. I also quite often feel frustrated, so I'll go on runs for that too.\n\nI am nearly 18, so I'm just exiting adolescence. So some things I may do may be due to immaturity. Some things I do may be also influenced by me having Autism (professionally diagnosed). And I did say I am sleep deprived, and I am not the most healthy, so that may affect how I function.\n\nAnyways, if you need me to elaborate on anything, feel free to ask. But I hope I explained myself well, and my reasons for things too. \n\nAlso how I wrote is how I speak, however I have also edited this many times to refine what I wish to say.", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "I am Trying to figure out my MBTI, I wanna use Cognitive Functions to decide them. I am an ESFP, Based off the E vs I, S vs N, T vs F, and P vs J way to decide MBTI. But based on the fact I use a Lot of Fe, I am not an ESFP based off of my Cognitive Functions.\n\nI Don't think I use Fi in my Function stack, prior to what I thought when I thought I was ISFP. I am very aware what people think of me, and I make sure that people don't view me as weird, because I'm Not. I am Also Very aware Socially, and am very aware of when others act different from what is Socially Accepted. I am interested in how people View me, I want to know what people Think of me, which Is why I love personality tests. I also sometimes imagine hypothetical conversations with people without thinking about it, if that's relevant. Is that an Intuition thing? No clue. I also get worried people misinterpet what I mean so I clarify sometimes.\n\nI also try to help people as much as I can which makes me come off as Pushy or Nosy, which is True, I am A very nosy person, and I am very redundant and repeat myself a lot without noticing. But I also don't wanna annoy people, and think of many possibilities that could be an outcome of me trying to help Which makes me not do anything, or I feel Bad but I don't know how to particularly help because I don't relate to their situation.\n\nI have decided I have a Fe - Si - Ne - Ti Stack, which makes me ESFJ. Which may be Very Fitting in ways, But I am not very keen on Routine, which makes me think I might not be ESFJ. I am also very inconsistent, which makes me wonder If I am an ESFJ or not. I am also not sure how I react to stress is like. Typical of a ESFJ? When I am Stressed I tend to become a Prick to people and I believe that everyone is Stupid and that I am Always right and that Everyone is Wrong. I am most definitely extroverted and when I am bored it's the Most EXCRUCIATING THING IN THE WORLD I HATE IT . \n\nI am also very reliant on my interests for my happiness and when they don't give me that happiness it makes me feel drained and depressed until it makes me feel happy again. My interests run in cycles since around I turned 14(Im turning 15 on the 28th)(Currently in the Kittydog, Bill Moseley, and MBTI cycle. Lol.), so Basically I go through those interests. I lose interest in one for a while, switch to another interest Involuntarily, until I lose interest in that, and then go back to the other. It is distressing to me half the time if I lose interest in something because I put a lot of my personality into these interests.\n\nThe way I describe this makes me seem a lot more sensitive than I am, I am not very Affected other people's emotions. If someone is Sad, I don't get Sad or some shit. I think . I don't know. I can't really think of how I feel unless I'm feeling the feeling, which I am currently not doing.

{"submission": "I'm a person who's a bit tangled up on what they want. It varies through inspiration of \"idols\" I pick up and admire through media. I can be a person who's very sensitive to perceived feelings of others. Usually at this time, it's paying attention to perceived negative emotions directed at me out of anxiety. I want to be a psychiatrist because I apparently have a gift for knowing others, intuiting their intentions and feelings. I can understand their actions on a deeper level, discarding shallow judgements. I often set goals for myself in my hobbies. In whatever I'm interested in, I will ruthlessly pursue it with the hardest tunnel vision of all time. So much so it irritates those around me. I can be insistent on others doing what I say or listening to my suggestions because I'm trying to better their lives or introduce them to what I think are objectively good things. But this is more in private with family and friends. In public, I'm more quiet and find myself as a complete opposite. In private, I'm confrontational, honest, fearless and confident. In public, I'm nervous, quiet, stuck in the limelight and fail to make an impression. My biggest focus at jobs for some time is trying to integrate socially and failing. I spend a lot of time envisioning my ideal self (which changes based on my inspiration) rather than achieving it in my depression. I'm not an extrovert, I'm more of an ambivert. I don't like active, social places. One on one in certain settings under certain pretenses, I'm very successful and confident in my interactions with others. In groups, I can get drowned out. I'm very self-aware and understand myself, others and the systems I use in my head. I dislike circlejerks and refuse to be a part of them.

{"submission": " Hope people still answer text posts on this sub. My answers will be short and concise for the sake of reading efficiency.\n\nI think I'm Ti dom with enneagram 9 or 5, but not sure. Lmk if this sounds like that or something else. Appreciate it!\n\n \u2606Age, gender, & general description\nFemale 24 year old. I am a relatively easygoing person, I don't take things too seriously. I'm not afraid of changing direction in life if I think it'll make it better. I'm very private and independent. My biggest desires are independence, freedom, and peace.\n\n\u2606Description of upbringing\nConventional upbringing with two parents and one other sibling. Parents weren't too strict but had high expectations, which shaped me into a very responsible and independent person. No strong religious influence. Traditions were important to them, but not to me. Family is not more important to me than my own life, career, and desires.\n\n \u2606Job / Career\nI work as a night shift RN on a medsurg unit in a hospital. I love the flexibility of the career as it allows for change within the field and allows for growth. Schedule is also flexible, which I like cause I hate routine. I work nights cause I can only be a productive member of society at nighttime, when the world is quiet.\n\n \u2606How would you feel spending a weekend alone?\nJust fine, I do that all the time. I do whatever I want at any moment and I'm never bored alone.\n\n \u2606Relationship with surroundings, sports, and the outdoors\nI think I am most in my element when I react to my surroundings fluidly, allowing myself to stay in my head and pop back into the real world when I feel like it. I like sports & think they're very fun. I don't like spending much time in the outdoors; my home is my fortress.\n\n \u2606Relationship with curiosity and ideas\nI think I am able to think creatively and originally, but I need to be inspired by something: the people I observe, the life I envision living, the style I strive to achieve. I like daydreaming, only as long as I have a plan to make those dreams reality. I am only slightly more curious than the average person, but I do tend to think more deeply and analyze better than most people.\n\n \u2606Thoughts about leadership and leadership style\nI am a good team player and a hard worker. My leadership qualities shine in my ability to be a quiet strength pillar for the team and encourage them in a relaxed and non-judgmental manner. I take loss well and am very receptive to feedback and ideas for improvement. My focus is on having fun.\n\n \u2606Coordination and working with your hands\nI hate working with my hands because I have no patience for detail and don't enjoy it. I give up easily at things I am not naturally good at, so I never give it a chance. I am averagely coordinated, but I do enjoy activities that require accuracy, as it is a skill can improve in.\n\n \u2606Relationship with art\nI am not artsy at all, I lean more towards STEM fields in general. The closest thing to art and self-expression I come is through my style and wardrobe. Out of all the art forms, I enjoy writing most. I despise making any art that involves detail work. I dislike poetry because it's pretentious, and I am very critical of poorly written literature.\n\n \u2606Opinion on past, present, and future\nMost of my time and energy, about 80%, is spent living in the present and not thinking about past or future. Another 15% is spent thinking about the future, planning for the future, and having loose plans for only the next few years. The last 5% is spend thinking about the past and how things have changed since a certain point in my past.\n\n \u2606How do you feel about someone asking for your help?\nI am almost always down to help anyone with anything, ONLY as long as I am not sacrificing my own time, comfort, and resources.\n\n \u2606Do you need logical consistency in your life?\nI can't imagine my life without logical consistency, I'd probably end up in a mental ward.\n\n \u2606Thoughts on efficiency and productivity\nEfficiency is crucial for me. I will try as many methods and ways of doing things as necessary to find the most efficient and best way to do things, and I am unafraid to change things up for the sake of efficiency. Productivity is not too important to me, as I like to take life slow. But I do need to have goals and ambitions, or else I'd feel empty and purposeless.\n\n \u2606Do you control others and how?\nNo, I try not to meddle in others' lives because I wouldn't like others meddling in mine. I have no interest in other people's lives most of the time anyway.\n\n \u2606Hobbies\nI am a very lazy girl. I love relaxing and doing nothing. I do low effort things like watching youtube or tv shows. Also, I play a lot of video games, preferably to some degree competitive, due to the opportunity for improvement in my skills.\n\n \u2606Learning style\nI recently did a test that showed I am a mix between kinesthetic and a visual learner. Basically, I need try to do something myself to learn it, or I need to have someone demonstrate it as I watch. I also love learning via problem solving.\n\n \u2606Strategizing and project management \nMy strategy is figure it out as I go. I tend to procrastinate and I let the deadline pressure push me to work. I've gotten in trouble in group projects before due to my procrastination, but somehow at the end it's always me that produces the best and most quality work. I was a straight A student putting in the bare minimum effort, doing everything at the very last moment every single time.\n\n \u2606What is important to you and what are your aspirations?\nIt's important for me to be able to make my own decisions about anything that involves me and my life. I want to maintain independence and freedom from other people, but avoid feeling lonely (which I am prone to). I aspire to have fun in life and achieve true inner peace with myself and the world.\n\n \u2606What are your fears?\nThat I get stuck in something I can't get out of. I fear death and dying. I am a hypochondriac. I fear being irrelevant and my existence meaning nothing. I experience existential dread very often.\n\n \u2606Attachment to reality vs daydreams\nI prefer to live in the real world, but somehow I always get stuck in my head daydreaming about doing things in the real world. Most of the time I try to make my dreams reality, but I am just lazy and struggle to discipline myself.\n\n \u2606Relationship with emotions\nI am very uncomfortable with feeling emotions, good or bad. I feel weak and exposed showing them. At my healthiest, I live my life in a fairly neutral state of emotion-- I don't feel things too deeply. My emotions tend to sneak up on me and bubble up until I cannot conceal them, so I express them as soon as I feel them. Unassuming people who don't deserve it can sometimes catch a stray. I just prefer to be able to move on from them as soon as possible, I never dwell.\n\n \u2606Do you often find yourself agreeing with people to appease them?\nYes, if I don't care for those people's opinions or thoughts. I'll agree with anything they want me to agree with, because I just don't care. However, I am very comfortable expressing my unfiltered opinions with people I am comfortable with, and challenge theirs (almost to a fault; I've been called \"disagreeable\" for this reason).", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Firstly, I apologize if my English breaks at some point since it's not my native. I hope I give you a good enough description of myself as well. (and that it doesn't leave you feeling bored) I've been on the journey of discovering my MBTI/enneagram/tritype for a very long time, but I can't seem to find an answer, so I turned for help here. \u2661 I've been told on various forums that I'm either an INFJ, INFP or ISFP/4w5 or 9w1/496. But I guess I'm not skilled enough to decide for myself. So I greatly appreciate any insight.\n\n\u2661 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI'm 23 years old. (24 in a couple of months)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI'm a female, I'm cisgender. (I never had trouble relating to my gender and always seen myself as a girl, if that information is something of value.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI see myself as child-like, shy and sometimes a bit somber. I don't make friends easily and when I do, I feel kind of left out in a way in a friend group. I don't like working out and sweating but I still do it for health benefits and looks. I've never been in a relationship or experienced anything related to that. I never had many friends growing up and those that I had, I either grew apart from or they turned out to be using me, or in some way they weren't my true friend.\n\nWhen I notice people around me (my friends, or just anyone in general) start expressing some behaviors that I usually do and that are natural to me, I start behaving differently (to a degree that I can still feel like me, ie. not like something I feel like I'm not). Even if it's not intentional on their part, it makes me uncomfortable. I like fashion (I've changed my style quite a bit up until now and I'd say I'm very versatile in terms of my taste but I'm not sure if it depends on my mood or something else I'm not aware of.) My taste in music is also very diverse but I lean towards sadder music. I like when music inspires my imagination (because I tend to imagine things with my eyes open) so I don't really listen to it just because, it's rather something I take pretty seriously (like fashion too) because I feel that those things describe me. They shaped me to an extent as well. (but so did some negative experiences even though I try not to identify with my trauma)\n\nSpeaking about myself doesn't really flow easily, I kind of have to premeditate and think about what I'm going to say. I sometimes feel like I know myself well since I'm the one that's with me trough everything but mostly I feel like I know nothing about me, like I don't know who I truly am. Sometimes I just wish someone comes along and tells me what I am. I don't know what I believe, what I want to be either sometimes. Maybe my goal is to be happy, because I read that all that we ever want is because we believe it's going to make us happy.\n\nI never had any desire for a career, to be academically accomplished and such. I've always just wanted to live comfortably (in a material sense) and not have to take care of anybody but myself and make the space I live in beautiful, go shopping and such. I was never really fond of children but always loved baby animals and found them much cuter and more bearable I guess. I don't think I have ever been in love truly with someone that is real in a sense that it wasn't some form of a fictional character (from anime, books, movies or someone I made up).\n\nI feel compassion towards people, for example if I see someone limping or walking badly due to old age and so on. But also I see people as strange sometimes. This is maybe random but I find human bodies especially strange (even though I sometimes feel like human body is like a form of art, I usually think how weirded out I get when I really think about the body). And relating to what i wrote earlier, I don't mind being seen as naive, weak or even stupid or people making fun of me as long as I don't feel bad about myself for being that way. (sorry if things are a little random, I'm trying to give as much information as I can \u2661)\n\n\u2661 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI've been sent by my parents to many psychiatrists and therapists but to my knowledge (since parents never said anything to me about what was said to them about me) I've never been diagnosed with anything. Other than than that, I don't have any medical conditions/disabilities. (I was iron deficient if that something that's important.)\n\n\u2661 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nParents were very strict and distant but controlling and manipulative. I don't feel I had a carefree childhood. I don't even remember anything from that time except traumatic experiences. Parents were orthodox Christians but never taught me anything about faith (or about anything in general except that I am to listen to what they say to me or otherwise bad things will happen to me).\n\n\u2661 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI'm in a university studying psychology, so I don't have any job yet. I don't really like it. But the truth is I don't know what I really like. I'm not even sure who I am. I chose psychology because I was told I can potentially be financially stable as a therapist (in country where I'm from, therapists have a private practice that is expensive hence the advice). I've already been studying philosophy in a different university but gave on that, and the same thing happened with philology. I also gave up. I was considering going to university for software engineering but during my preparations for the exam I decided I was going to choose psychology.\n\nAs in what really interests me, I'm not sure like I said. I would maybe say fashion design but only because I want to learn to sew my own clothes (I don't really have interest in selling my designs).\n\n\u2661 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would bloom like a flower if I was alone for the whole weekend honestly. I love to spend time alone (I usually think about the future though). I never had people that I truly loved to be around so I don't know if that would change if I did. But even when I imagine myself with my ideal people, we aren't always together. I usually like to stand out a bit, but only if it's my choice. Meaning I don't like feeling like I'm the least liked friend. I just prefer it when I can come and go as I please without worrying about what will they think about me if I do or if it will affect them in any way.\u00a0\n\n\u2661 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI never had opportunities to develop those kind of preferences because as a child I was always surveilled and wasn't allowed to do things I liked (whether they were mental activities or physical ones). So it's hard to say, but I guess I'm more of a indoors type of person. I'm not particularly good at sports (I have good balance and flexibility though, if that counts).\n\nI enjoy watching anime, reading manga, reading about spirituality and self development, collecting crystals, records, perfumes, jewelry and going for walks alone in the woods (if I happen to be alone because I'm sadly usually not). Also I like aesthetics, so I like customizing my phone, gadgets, I like playing video games, taking care of myself (ie. skincare, haircare,...), I like to use make up, hair dyes, accessories (really anything that I feel a pull towards if that makes sense).\u00a0\n\n\u2661 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would say I am curious but also not in a way. I'll try to explain. I stay out of people's business and people in general aren't really my point of interest (I can't say \"not at all\" but generally speaking). What I am curious about are ideas, life philosophies or just things that interest me ever since I can remember. I'm going to be honest and say I'm not interested to hear how was someone's day, or what their child/pet/significant other said or did. (sadly those are usually conversations I have to pretend I like)\n\nMy ideas are about art/designs that I want to create. That's about it when it comes to my ideas. I don't come up with grand solutions about ending human suffering in the world for example. (even though I think nobody should suffer)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYes, I do feel like I have more ideas than I can execute sometimes.\n\n\u2661 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo, definitely not. I rather dislike it. I don't have any aspirations to be a leader or for someone to look up to me. I doubt I would be good at it because leaders have authority and I don't. And people don't really respect me I think, I talk quietly, so I don't think I would be suited for a role either. If I absolutely had to be in a leadership position, I would be kind and gentle towards my subordinates.\u00a0\n\n\u2661 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm not sure. I have a kind of hypersensitivity to people around me, I sense when people look at me for example. I can multitask, I can text and walk avoiding any obstacle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI don't necessarily enjoy working with my hands but I like the end result (a piece of clothing, art or something like that). So I couldn't really describe the activity because, the activity itself doesn't bring me joy but rather what is created as a result and what makes me happy is the fact that I believe that those little steps are bringing me to my desired future. (but like I said I'm not really sure why I do the things I do)\n\n\u2661 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI would say I am. My art is usually reflecting my desires. Something I'm not able to achieve yet or not at all. (like being an immortal mermaid)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI appreciate art that I can see myself in or that represents an aspect of me in a way. I kind of like to think about what will others think about me if I say I like a certain art piece so I try to choose accordingly.\n\n\u2661 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThat's a hard question. I don't really know to navigate time I guess. But I'm usually thinking about the future. I deal with them quite poorly. I process the past badly present is like on auto pilot usually and the future is usually what I think about.\n\n\u2661 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI don't really like helping unless I offer my help first but I probably do that because it's a nice thing to do not so much because I truly want it. Not to say I don't want to help at all it's just that this first aspect prevails. When I decide to help is usually out of fear of being seen as mean or them not wanting to help me if I ever need help.\n\n\u2661 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nNo, I don't. Or maybe yes, since we all have our own versions of what logic represents, so I guess some consistency is nice like for example is we walk on the ground than I would like it to be that way and not wake up one day having to walk upside down on the sky. (random I know, sorry \u2661). But as long as I feel good and feel like my desires are coming true, I don't worry myself about weather or not life is logical.\n\n\u2661 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nNot important. It's not that I don't feel the pressure to be that way (so I can achieve my goals). It's about that I'm not very competitive and those two concepts kind of carry an air of competitiveness around them and I don't feel that way. But if we strictly speak about them in terms of self management then yes they are important and I think could be more productive and responsible.\n\n\u2661 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI try not to do that because it makes me feel weird but I do try to insinuate things to others (but only if something is really bothering me, I could never insinuate attraction towards someone for example). I don't know if that counts as being manipulative.\n\nLike I won't ever say to someone that they don't treat me the way I want to be treated but I will rather just walk away from them forever or if I can't do that (if we live closely or something like that I will try to come up with excuses or insinuate how others are getting treated so nicely (but only if I see a personal benefit from insinuating that, for example keeping a friendship isn't something I see as very beneficial all the time)).\n\n\u2661 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMy hobbies are going shopping and collecting things I like. I like them because they make me feel good, they make me thing about my perfect version of the future. If I'm being honest my life is all about spending time leisurely (at least I would like it to be that way)\n\n\u2661 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI would say my learning style is maybe visual? I struggle when things are very conceptual. Not necessarily because I'm not able (I probably could if put more effort in) but because I get de-motivated if I'm not good at something from the beginning. I prefer no classes at all. The things I have an interest for naturally get absorbed into my mind. The whole idea that I'm going somewhere to study is kind of closing my capacity to learn in a way. I learn naturally when I'm invested, but I would say it's not with logic or physical senses. That kind of sounds foreign to me but I could be wrong.\n\n\u2661 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI try be organized but I just usually end up doing things last minute. I tend to just calm down even if it's the last minute and just do my best in that short window frame.\n\n\u2661 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally, I have none (other than to have a job that can support all my desires).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn a personal plan, I would like to be the version of my self that I have in my head. That includes my personality, looks, abilities and relationships.\n\n\u2661 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy fears are not accomplishing what I want in this lifetime. People usually make me uncomfortable. The version of myself I have to pretend to be makes me uncomfortable. I hate feeling like I'm going to end up being something I'm not. I believe the reason for all of this is not available to me. My guess would be because I believe it's going to make me happy but why would those thing make me happy is something I don't know.\n\n\u2661 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI have hope, I believe everything will turn out in my favor, that there's even a possibility for things to turn out better than I imagined them. I look at things differently. I'm kind of bubbly as well.\u00a0\n\n\u2661 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI'm very sad but unable to cry. I feel like the worst existing thing to ever be present. I don't feel pretty or smart or have any desire for things I usually love. Everything just kinda makes me cry and makes me irritable.\n\n\u2661 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI guess I am attached to this reality. I do daydream but I try to do so only when I'm alone because I'm somewhat afraid not to let it show on my face or my body language. I can be quite unaware of my surroundings when I let myself daydream alone but it lasts for a couple of minutes. Since I do it usually when I'm alone I could be wrong because there's no input from others.\n\n\u2661 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nAbout my favorite fictional people, about will I find home after I die, about do I come from the stars, about my future as if my goals are already achieved.\n\n\u2661 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nUsually a long time. And yes, I do consider after the decision has been made that I made a wrong choice. But I try not to think about it to much if I can because it makes me feel anxious and just bad in general.\n\n\u2661 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nUsually quite some time. I don't always know how I'm feeling and what I'm feeling. I'm generally left feeling very confused but I'm so used to that I just let it go and let it be that way. I'm even not very aware of people intentions towards me either. A realization can come even years later. I would say emotions are a big part of my life. I try to monitor my moods. This is going to sound weird probably but I like to be happy but also appear a bit melancholic and sad. But I try not feel those emotions because I believe emotions create outcomes. But all of that management comes really hard for me, I have put a lot of effort in to do so. So I think I gave up on that recently and just try to feel happy if I can.\n\n\u2661 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes I do. Very often to be honest. Because I'm afraid of something I guess. Like for example that my action of not agreeing with someone could lead to them not wanting to talk to me anymore and than that would somehow spiral into me not having reached my goals in the future.\u00a0\n\n\u2661 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't really break the rules unless I think I can get away with it easily. Sometimes I break them even if I think it would cause me some trouble but depend on what kind of rules you mean. Like I will probably more likely break social rules than a law. I try to be nice to everyone. But sometimes I can't put on a mask on and pretend that I like what is being talked about or that I'm fine with how someone's behaving. I try to fit in out of fear sometimes and low key hate myself for it.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn't challenge any authority just for the sake of it. But if I feel like I'm being asked to pretend I'm something I'm not, I will try to challenge the authority figure or suffer in silence because I didn't do it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf I do break rules it's only because I believe it would benefit me.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hello, I have done a couple of times the Myers Briggs test and have gotten intp and once infp. I am still rather confused about my mbti tho.\n I haven't yet read the congnitive functions but I would like to know anyone's thought on my personality type.\n I have related mostly to intp stereotypes and some infp ones.\n Let me tell you about me tho. After all it's about my personality type we are talking about.\n I have a blurred image from when I was young but I do remember being what's considered a normal kid. I was funny and had friends. I never though had a \"deep\" friendship only 1 or 2. The other ones where just surface? Friendships if you get what I mean. Until 2nd grade of junior high I had 2 friends but things change from then. I just shut down and I have no friends anymore and I tottaly mean none! It's honestly very hard for me to maintain a meaningful friendship, even if I meet a person, I don't know how to start or keep up a convo except if we're talking about something that I like. People also don't talk to me I am always cold and apathetic towards them and rather boring. With a friend If my mum didn't tell me to call them or tell me to ask her how she is I wouldn't, because I don't understand that I have to do that to saw that I care. I find it difficult to saw my emotions and generally express myself. Sometimes I feel empty and very apathetic. But I am not always on \"robot\" mode I do have feelings and I sometimes can't hold my anger when someone does stupid things or with my brother. Now if we are talking about the smart part I wouldn't say I am school smart I also procrastinate a lot. I do get decent grades without trying but also teachers help with grades. I do love mind games tho, sudoku or books with riddles and problem solving I have solved a lot. It's my last year of high school and I honestly don't know what I want to do with my life. \n I think when I was younger I used to be more emotinal but now I am rather not. I remember that one time my friends dog was killed and I tried to feel sad because I thought that's what I was supposed to feel at that time. Did it work? Yes it did. \n I also am very awkward and have a lot of interests and collect random stuff like old money. (The oldest one is from the 40s)\n I am not sure what else to say from here.... I definetly want to hear your opinions thought!\n(Don't mind grammar mistake or spelling one's I was bored to correct them)", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "This wall of text for typing yours truly. I spent an entire day on it.\n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m a female minor currently in High School so that should be enough time for my 2nd function to show up now. I\u2019m a born and raised Southeast Asian who moved to the US during my 7-8th years of existence and I must remind myself to use my one of my inner voice of thought like this is written to me and only to me to achieve somewhat unbiased answers that may not derail the JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF COGNITION in which I am the defendant without an attorney, and I\u2019m being blinded by the sole spotlight in a dark room as I try to take a good look at the 8 judges whispering in an eloquent language I\u2019m too dumb to understand. Which means I\u2019m not allowed to hide my crimes behind my identity forgings. Dammit. Also, what the hell is with the influx of people going \u201cAhahaha, type me based off my pics lolol XD\u201d *inserts random pics that offers nothing but suggest they\u2019re just doing this out of disrespect* ?? Do tell, I\u2019m super confused. Anyways, I\u2019m often perceived by strangers and not-very-close acquaintances as a upbeat bubbly kind of girl who switches very quickly to the quiet girl but if one digs deeper, they\u2019ll see a gremlin who at this point is just winging life but also stressing about it like some contradiction like a lazy perfectionist, who thinks of weird thoughts like what it feels like to be a rotisserie chicken in PE and spins around instead of participating ohhhh now, this is not a good example of general description folks. Ok fine. I\u2019m a introverted stubborn, lazy perfectionist/procrastinator, undisciplined, passionate for a few things and then it slowly fizzles out then gets reignited again, indifferent to the rest,  social mimic \\[take note idk who i truly am, so don't assume that this is the real ego talking but simply a reflection in a house of mirrors\\], inconsiderate, nonjudgmental (unless you do something stupid, concerning, or illegal) with no real hobbies except art and gaming.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nUnknown. Probability: 0.5%. I don\u2019t know if anger issues/temper counts. Most likely that\u2019s genetic from my father\u2019s side. Unfortunately, I am worse at controlling it than he is, thanks to the fact that he\u2019s 40-something idk but it's wisdom and patience from old age and having 2 kids.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI don\u2019t have any religious or structured influence in my upbringing, no mention of the mere concept of it, save for the time my cousins and I came across my paternal grandfather putting bowls of sweet bean porridge on an altar. I asked if I could eat it because my brain tells me that nobody just leaves out fresh food near a statue so that statue must be pretty important to someone so obv, I should ask. He tells us that we have to pray for it, so my cousin kneels and starts saying stuff I don't understand and I just mimic them for the food. No questions asked. Other than that, I wasn\u2019t disciplined much or was enforced rules upon since my parents were busy working to gather money to move out the house to another house then later to the US for my brother\u2019s and my education. So I sort of figured my way around in my younger years with a bit of guidance from my parents and cartoon shows, and some figuring out/adopting from my peers. It got stricter in the nagging as I grew but still not much rule enforcement. Not even bedtime, just a disappointed sigh. *thumbs up*\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don\u2019t have a job but I\u2019d imagine if I got some regular boring ol\u2019 part time job, I\u2019d be overly aware of the passage of time from the constant glances at the clock or my phone.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nBro. I\u2019d feel content yet at the same time scared. I\u2019m not used to the absence of my guardians. I\u2019d stay up awake with a knife under my pillow ready to attack a possible home intruder (I don\u2019t trust my home\u2019s security system for good reason) and would turn on the AC all day so the unnerving silence would go away.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like it, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI dislike most things physical. I\u2019m forced to take mixed martial arts by my parents for a year and I still hate it even though I know it\u2019s for self defense. I\u2019m not good at sports, my body coordination sucks and my fine coordination still sucks even though I\u2019m an intermediate artist. I can\u2019t throw, or catch, or serve, or smack anything at all for the life of me. I think I\u2019ll stick to staying inside with the AC, thanks.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI don\u2019t know to be honest. I was not born with curiosity and if I was, it was probably squashed like most other kids. I noticed an uptick in questions around my 13th year of existence but it was not a \u201cWhy? Why? Why?\u201d situation even though 10% of the time it is. There's been another uptick in curiosity this year since I learned that my bio teacher is over qualified for his job since he has a PhD in biology so whenever we\u2019re doing an assignment or in work time, I\u2019d go up and ask questions about related stuff and deeper clarification. Then I proceed to forget most of the stuff. My memory sucks.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nDepends. If it\u2019s not something I\u2019m good at, I won\u2019t take charge. If it is something I\u2019m good at, I\u2019d want to take charge (since I have an idea of what I want it to be) but if there\u2019s someone else better, they\u2019ll get it. Leadership positions in general however are stress-inducing and it means I\u2019m placing responsibility on myself, there's a higher chance my temper will flare, and I will slack off and get disappointment from the people I\u2019m supposed to lead. I don\u2019t know what my leadership style would be. Definitely not authoritarian. Hopefully.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n(See physical activities question) I draw and paint digitally so I suppose yes. I like creating things and I like stories so art is good for smooshing two together.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nMy art is semi-realistic, like those Asian video game art styles (like reverse 1999 and Genshin but worseee in render and sketch and all those fundamentals), since I was influenced by it when I first started developing that skill.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI don\u2019t know honestly. I don\u2019t think I have much of an opinion on time but I guess I\u2019d approve if the past is acknowledged and remembered but it doesn\u2019t get in the way of progression and change of the future, since trying to keep the past and project it onto progress will stagnate it or even degrade it and ruin what we have built when the future has the potential to be better is dumb but trying to throw away the past for the sake of the future means discarding learned wisdom and experience from history and tradition. Imagine 35% past, 65% future. The present? The present is okay I guess.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIn society, I feel obliged to help. With the people I\u2019m okay with, I would usually off-load tasks to others if they\u2019re difficult or boring and I will show it unintentionally or not. If I did actually help them, it could be for multiple reasons like I\u2019m bored, I did smth bad earlier and now I feel the pressure and this is my silent way of saying sorry because i don\u2019t like apologizing even though I know I am fully capable of saying it just fine, just wanna help lol, the task is fun, I\u2019m curious, etc. All in all, I don't like working.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYES. But why? Hmm, I think if there\u2019s no logical consistency, nothing can be understood and I\u2019d very much like to understand the reality (or is it? *Vsauce music intensifies*) in which I inhabit, thank you very much. I know this is not the fundamental reason why I need logical consistency and I myself do not know yet so I\u2019ll just list possible answers: Truth? So I don\u2019t go insane from my human composition, fearing the reality in which I inhabit from its lack of predictability and sense? Maybe it's a human condition to understand how the object relates to the subject in an attempt to find understanding and thus peace within itself and existence and thus some turn to logic to find it and others turn to emotions for it. Wait. That\u2019s just for consistency-\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nPretty important. Well, mostly for efficiency. I value not wasting my time suffering in work so taking the most efficient route means less time to suffer and also less work and I have more time to use it for unproductive stuff like gaming :)). Productivity is also somewhat important for me, I want to be productive so I can make a difference in the world (huge progression of sciences!) and leave my mark knowing dang well my life isn\u2019t a waste of existence among the people who settled for working for corporations who just want money and does nothing in the long run like come on, you\u2019re just one of the millions of rich ceos in a history of rich ceos) but in practice, I am rarely productive. I\u2019m no stereotypical xsxjs. If you want stereotypical xsxj, go talk to my mom.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nSomewhat. I dunno how (I know this is for Te vs Fe and I can do both, just poorly. I lack the charisma for it lol) but I know that I do somewhat. I mainly did it for their own good (ei i think they\u2019re doing something stupid or making it less fun for themselves and I want them to have fun or at least don't regret their actions.) Nowadays it's less since I don't really care anymore. *shrugs*\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI don't really have hobbies other than gaming and art. I find gaming is a serotonin giving mixture of technical skills (kudos to the coders who is sobbing in overtime, the musicians with sore limbs from the constant playing for osts etc etc) and artistic skill (writing, design, animation) and there are more reasons why I like my games. They offer: mental stimulation in puzzles, story, calculation for damages etc, some socialization for a lazy introvert without much irl consequences of accidentally saying smth wrong, wisdom (through playing the story, we may gain some wisdom on \u201creal life\u201d like how to steal stuff :) or even deduce mysteries), and it's also a way to do things you can\u2019t in real life like infinite scuba diving and beat up enemies and one shot em.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI struggle mostly in boring and tedious classes. I don\u2019t want to hear you go on and on about your dead husband for the 15th time this month as if it relates to what we\u2019re learning about even though he sounds like a pretty cool dude I guess. I prefer learning through logical discussion, experimentation, fun, engaging stuff, and figure things out with help and guidance ofc. I don't wanna memorize stuff, that\u2019s braindead. I wanna get to the bottom of things, and find the fundamental principle that can help me figure out new information. I wanna see everything connecting to everything in a way that makes sense bc for reasons unknown. I remember I got giddy because we have history SOL essay recently, and was given a prompt to answer and absolutely no directions but to answer it and ofc, I procrastinated but dang, me researching for stuff to answer that SOL prompt and going on spirals (and then stop bc i need to get enough info and sleep)  was stupidly fun in a weird way even if it\u2019s first period tmmr and I\u2019m sleep deprived. And ofc, visual learning is okay as well.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\u2026I\u2019m going to say this once. I have learned that behaviorism does not equate to cognitive functions and thus we can have a dumb, illogical istp and a smart enfj. I want you to type my cognition, not my behavior and skills. Anyways, I\u2019m average in strategizing but not long term consequences. I do not possess wisdom and experience a skilled strategist should have nor have I studied strategy. I write down the general goal, and when able would plan for it but when I can\u2019t, would just wing it just fine. Just stressfully if it\u2019s an important thing.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n    I would like to not di. I want to create and discover new important things, specifically in the science and engineering field and have my influence echo in humanity in a good way. I want to achieve the title of Art God. I want really close friends like the ones you\u2019d see in tv shows. I wanna help humanity advance towards a better future with my contribution towards stem fields. I wanna revolutionize the education system. I wanna NOT have sleep deprivation, thanks. I also want to learn criminology for the heck of it.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear creepy crawlies like most do and I still fear the absence of light even though I know that it\u2019s just the absence of photons, what I\u2019m truly afraid of the dark for is the possibility that I am not alone. Anyways, I feel uncomfortable witnessing people being affectionate (gross) and breaking basic social niceties (like straight up telling a stranger they wanna punch them). I\u2019m afraid that I am not as smart as I\u2019d like to be, or that maybe I do possess some intelligence but lack the knowledge to actually nurture and show it. My brain is the only thing I can offer to the world and if my brain is lacking then will I ever be understood and accepted?\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nThey don\u2019t exist.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI get even more moody and irritable, my anger flares, my patience decreases even more, and I\u2019m completely blind to the consequences of emotionally hurting people. I get defensive over my thoughts and ideas and will target others known weak points for it. This is the lowest point I have reached thus far in my existence so it may not be the lowest of lows but thankfully I don't explode that long to that extreme. Usually it\u2019s brief and rare (like once every 5 years?) provided that I am able to isolate myself away from people, the spark to the fuse, anyways.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nSometimes I get absorbed in a stream of sensations when I have nothing to do (mostly when chilling with my friends during lunch time and listening to them talk), and I just look around out of boredom. But I do daydream or think about something often that I briefly lose perception of time and space. I still do have basic visual awareness during this but energy is delegated to the visualization and language parts of the brain to produce my inner voice and daydreams.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI\u2019d think about why the hell am i even in a blank, empty room, then start to wonder if this is reality or a dream, then wonder if I\u2019m in a psych ward or if this is some isolation torture tactic because I\u2019ve somehow came across things I shouldnt know and currently do not know, then try to find my way out, fail, then sit around thinking of my regrets and the true meaning of existence, and then yell at the walls at my imaginary warden for self-entertainment but maybe also just in case I\u2019m actually right, then dance around like I\u2019m in a fantasy ballroom and then cue fight scene, and then I start talking to myself about Dimensions and human perception. And then if I\u2019m not out of there within 24 hours, I\u2019ll die from my lack of human needs before I die from insanity. End.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt\u2019ll take me at least a day to make a really important decision, I\u2019d imagine, from all the researching about my options and my decision before I made the decision and the discussion with others for perspective and staring at my blank tablet screen. And I can very easily change my mind after the decision is made either from new info or new realizations and I\u2019ll act as if I\u2019ll die from my terrible decision for the next bit.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nIt takes me fairly quickly to process them. It\u2019s not that I suppress them a lot, maybe some of it is repressed sadness that bubbles up in the silent hours and I am unaware and surprised at its existence but sometimes I feel nothing at all. It\u2019s fairly important I guess, but obv, sense has to be placed over emotion and I think I can push it aside to prioritize what must and should be done from a thoughtful standpoint rather than rash impulse of chemicals. Anger? Anger, I can\u2019t control. Anger issues. Honestly, I\u2019m not very good at controlling my emotions at all, it\u2019s just the much more minor, milder emotions that I can control.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nOccasionally. But mostly, nope. I\u2019d just tell them I disagree and usually it comes off in a non-aggressive way since I don't feel aggression towards their opinion, I just thought I\u2019d let them know I disagree and then we can come to a wiser perspective, aye? Why should I appease them? \ud83e\udd28 I mean, unless it\u2019s anything absolutely stupid (flat earth, conspiracy theories etc etc), I will flare up.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't really break rules since I don't like conflict directed at me and also because I have better things to do in my life but I do think authority should be challenged. Humans require challenges or conflict to achieve good decisions and innovation as it forces upon them responsibility and accountability to be and do better instead of taking the easy way out and slack off and oppress people. Sometimes rules are just plain stupid so sure, maybe I\u2019ll break some rules but I haven\u2019t come across such rules without some shred of reason behind them.

{"submission": "* Self descriptions:\n   * I am very task oriented. I am always ready to do something, to accomplish something new\n      * This gets to the point where I get excited/bored of things depending on if they help with my immediate tasks or not\n      * I will also dislike excessive amounts of planning, philosophy, and emotional considerations. All of those things guide the hands that operate and strike, but at a certain point, they also just feel like stalling and you will find me getting blunt and impatient\n      * Interestingly, this basically causes me to lose some levels of aesthetic appreciation, as there is very little action to simply seeing and appreciating something.\n   * I seem to always want a problem to solve or crisis to avert, things cannot ever be smooth sailing\n      * This can be good in that I get a reputation as the first responder, the cool-headed troubleshooter, but also as the mediator (solving interpersonal issues) and therapist\n      * This got bad when I first started to work in that I started to artificially creating crisis for myself by procrastinating until the last minute to finish something.....and sometimes creating real crisis in the process when my work ended up being sub-par\n      * I can also get very irritated at people who don't want to solve problems, and instead just like to have conversations to troll each other. This is one of he only perspectives that I simply just do not understand, for the life of me.\n   * I can be very concerned for other people, especially for my close contacts but also for society as a whole, and I often make choices that I think would make my community a bit better when it comes to things like what I contribute with my work or what I do as a hobby\n   * I have noticed that I often fantasize life as being like a movie, and wanting it to play out like one. This used to make me hate my life because I always felt like my life was a terribly boring story and worry that my life is not measuring up to how it is supposed to look. And then I got older and I finally came to terms with how misguided this thought process is\n   * That said, this phrasing of how it should look does remind me that I often obsess with form and exactness. I can obsessively look for standards and exact definitions for what a perfect or normal thing should look like, even if one does not exist. (e.g. relationship, person, life goal) Though this mind set does make some sense in certain places. (e.g. programming libraries, moral codes, cultural norms, company rules, laws)\n   * I rarely if ever truly mock people. I would rather try to understand others, put myself into their shoes, and figure out the context and central beliefs that drive their actions. It is part of why I wanted to be a therapist, and also why I rarely complain about people. People generally make sense and seem reasonable to me\n   * I have noticed that I often go back and forth between being a conformist and an outcast. I sometimes feel like I should integrate into society and thus need to pick something specific to pursue and follow society's rules. Other times I just want to be a wild explorer, trying whatever new thing I want even if dangerous or stupid, and following my own set of principles\n   * When encountered with a choice between my principle and practicality, what I often do is choose practical option and hope to lean it towards the principled option in some way. Creating a middle point, if you will. However, this is not always an option, so I will often end up being successful in the world while absolutely miserable and guilty\n   * I can sometimes be a bit traditional, holding onto old cultural beliefs and wisdoms even though most people my age would rather try new stuff\n   * One thing that I only sometimes want to admit is I have a side to me that really wants to be special. I want to be a unique person and feel like the rules do not apply to me. Part of why I can be principled or traditional or action oriented is because most people around me are talkers and dreamers, it is a way for me to stand out\n   * I have to admit to not being the most logical person. I catch myself all the time saying illogical things. I have gotten better over time, but I think maybe I am a sweet-but-dumb kind of guy\n   * The one other type of person that I do not understand are people act aggressive in order to avoid showing that they are fragile on the inside. \n      * I think this triggers a weird reaction in me in that I can sense their fragility so I want to help, but their aggressive persona is flimsy and phony which triggers a destructive desire for me to rip it to shreds so that they can be more honest about things. My only working option so far is just to be quietly available and helping in quietly escalating ways\n   * I kind of hate speculation. I guess reading people is a kind of speculation, but I try to take it with a grain of salt, and also to back it up with evidence as soon as possible through questioning/conversations and body languages. Other than that, I hate most types of speculation. Ask me to describe, not predict.\n   * I think I have a conflicted feeling towards social etiquettes. On the one hand, they can be a helpful guideline for what is welcome or taboo for how to treat people, but on the other hand, it forces me to act in very insincere ways. I also hate the argument that social etiquette makes everyone behave themselves. I already don't want to hurt people and want to help, and you want to tie me down with even more rules than I already have to balance. Genius.\n   * I can be quite the jokester everywhere EXCEPT for at work, where I am almost always dead serious. Part of this is because I think life should be enjoyed, and part of this is because I can be anxious in social situations, and telling jokes lowers my mental concept of how serious this conversation is. It also helps that it makes me look very witty\n   * I think my life is very revolved around experiences. I trust my experiences the most, I prefer to rely on enlarging and recalling from my repository of past experiences when I work/problem solve, and I see creating pleasant experiences for myself and others as a life goal (hence why I used to want to get into entertainment, but now is also more open to design or even web development)\n* Descriptions from family, friends, and close colleagues:\n   * I think the common theme I get is I feel **reliable** and **stabilizing** to other people.  This does not mean that I am boringly repetitive or predictable, I heard, more so that I am non-judgmental, patient, adaptable, loyal, and calm even in frustrating situations\n   * I am told I am very sensitive, though not fragile. This mainly shows up in how I express empathy for everyone, even those that some think do not deserve empathy, and how that stops me from asserting myself too aggressively (though I am not a doormat)\n   * A few people have noted that I seem to have strong sense of principle, there are certain things that simply should be or should not be done, no matter what\n   * My mother once noted that I am very result driven, like her. We pick a goal and then we charge towards it with all our might. We do not explore, or dream, or form quiet routines of desperation. We just define a direction and charge in, adapting or improvising as needed\n   * Another common thing is I actually seem to take care of people decently well. Although I can get anxious about if I am doing well on it, if I actually stop panicking and just focus on showing others to a good time itself, people have told me that they have a really good time and are impressed with how thorough and considerate I am with everything\n   * I am told I am observant with object and perceptive with people such that I notice every little change and movement, any signs of discomfort or conflicts\n   * I am told that I am very anxious and wanting to always be perfect if possible, to the point where I suffer from self-loathing\n   * I am also told that I am a hands on person, I like to actually get boots on the ground and do work instead of sitting around waxing poetic or plotting impossible ploys\n   * I am also told I am very quiet, preferring to not talk too much about myself and my views. I prefer to do things with others instead of talking\n   * Some have noted that I often like to think one or two steps ahead, though not too far. So I never appear as a grand mastermind to anyone, but I can be a shrewd tactician accurately predicting your next moves before you do it and improvising quickly accordingly\n   * Silly side note: I have gotten more than a few comments where people I know compared me to a large shepherd dog due to being loyal, vigilant, protective, workaholic, friendly if also somewhat quiet", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\\*extreme oversensitivity: when I was in high school and went out to eat with a friends family. I remember feeling really nervous to thank the parent for buying food. I didn\u2019t want them to think they had to and felt weirdly guilty and didn\u2019t wanna bring attention to it. Another similar story was when I dropped my Starbucks drink alll over the floor and felt overwhelmingly guilty bc I didn\u2019t know if I should tell the baristas. I didn\u2019t want them to think I was telling them to clean it up for me or that I wanted a new free drink. I didn\u2019t know what to do and felt frozen with guilt. Also I don\u2019t know if I just wasn\u2019t raised on how to handle this stuff, but whenever my friends grandparents would die I would feel really guilty and worried about asking them if they were ok because I didn\u2019t wanna bring up something that would hurt them.\n\n\\*Struggle saying no but also because it makes things easier : once a friend asked to borrow my cat ears for a Halloween costume. I said yes and than last minute decided to be a cat too. So I texted another friend that was coming and asked for cat ears. The friend who borrowed mine through it was funny and said I didnt have to do that for her. But idk I just didn\u2019t wanna have to tell her no when I could easily get new cat ears from someone else! I didn\u2019t like the new cat ears as much but didn\u2019t care. I think I tend to put others first\n\n\\*I\u2019m pretty shy: in my own but feel bubbly around friends. I used to feel like I needed to act dumb to be funnny, give someone gossip, or act like someone to entertain them so they would talk to me. I always feel like I\u2019m only comfortable around some ppl and than I am comfortable talking to others with them, they are comfortable talking to anyone. I feel kinda depressed when I\u2019m shy and can\u2019t talk to ppl And anxious.\n\nI feel very in control of myself. Like when I do something wrong I know. I feel like I\u2019m very aware of why I do everything. ppl always say I seem innocent and do no wrong or that they hear nothing but great things abt me. But I always feel judged\n\n\\*If Im hurt by someone I tend to get quiet and think abt if it\u2019s true, if someone annoys me I only started ranting abt it recently. I also remember growing up, if something made me insecure I\u2019d get quiet. Like I wanted to be a popular girl. I was pretty average popularity and always a sidekick friend. When a girl pointed out \u201cpopular girls over over there.. unpopular girls sit w us\u201d I felt insecure bc I wanted to be popular. So I just went \u201cno no\u201d but rlly it\u2019s bc I didnt wanna admit to myself I wasn\u2019t cool or whatever.

My day is made when I make someone laugh, especially if one is sad. I hate when people are sad, hate themselves etc., not because I'm annoyed but because I'm very empathetic. I'll do my very best to reassure them and cheer them up, even if they have hurt me in the past, before cracking a few jokes. An example of this is with my mother. My mother was my bully throughout my life... but whenever she says that she looks ugly, I get mad. I tell her she's the most beautiful mother ever and reassure her. Are relationship has been getting better, but the hurtful things she did still sticks with me.\n\n\u2022I'm too scared to ever break up with someone. I'm scared to hurt them and leave them in pain, even if it's for a weak or a few months. I know it's stupid, and I need to be more assertive, I just don't want to be a negative impact in one's life. I want them to both have good memories and ones where they can learn to better themselves. I'm scared of making them backtrack a whole lot.\n\n\u2022I need someone to eventually find a sense of self. Maybe a group of people I'm close with. Basically, I need people or someone to feel like \"myself\". If I don't, I get agitated, depressed, distant and aggressive. Despite wanting a group of friends, I'm too scared to do so because people become distant or end up becoming a terrible person in just a few months. Ive been avoiding making real-life friends for two years because of the fear that It would never work out like it did before. My heart wants to love more people, but I stop myself and run away.\n\n\u2022I'm very understanding. When an argument forms, I can see both sides almost right away.

I have very strong opinions, especially political ones, and have a strong urge to debate and prove the other person wrong when I hear someone say something political that I disagree with.

Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m 18 years old and I\u2019d probably describe myself as a gender nihilist, but realistically I\u2019m probably just gender-fluid. At my core I\u2019d describe myself as an individualist, and I\u2019m rly into philosophical shit like Emma Goldman and stirner, things like that. I\u2019m pretty quiet, blunt, sardonic, but also probably mask that way too much in order to placate people while slowly resenting them and myself. I absolutely hate being controlled by something or someone. I either care too much about people or don\u2019t really care what they think at all depending on how well or what I personally think of them. I generally play therapist for my entire family. Never really felt comfortable in my own skin or expressing myself due to fear of backlash. If I don\u2019t wanna be somewhere you can absolutely tell that I don\u2019t wanna be there.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\n Autism, anxiety, mayyyyybe depression?\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nFine, I guess. My mother\u2019s well intentioned but strict, and has admitted to me she likely has some form of psychological problems. She still struggles to accept my sexuality and basically just doesn\u2019t acknowledge it despite me coming out twice, but we get along well as long as I constantly validate her own problematic relationships, which I\u2019m fine with doing. Also forced me to go to college from home at a local university because she was worried bc I was autistic, and also had a very clear set goal for me and my future career that I wasn\u2019t necessarily on board with. My father was mostly passive and engaged with my sister who played college basketball, and really only started to try and connect with me as a teenager. Most of the time it\u2019s him trying to talk about pro wrestling with me, even though we don\u2019t really see eye to eye on that either, but I at least appreciate the attempt, but I can also tell he\u2019s miserable. My parents also hate each other and usually have monthly disputes, quarterly quarrels, and biyearly blowups.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n\nI would feel wonderful. I really never get any alone time and feel at peace with myself when I can just be myself without worrying that someone\u2019s going to judge me.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed being active, especially as I\u2019ve gotten fitter as I\u2019ve become more adult, and I\u2019ve always been down for any form of sport, or even just working out. It\u2019s become somewhat routine for me, I obviously don\u2019t want to do it all the time, but I feel much better after doing it. I\u2019ve always enjoyed video games for as long as I remember, for a relatively weird kid, it was oftentimes my only sanctuary in a world where I didn\u2019t necessarily fit in.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would consider myself a pretty curious individual. It\u2019s not necessarily that I have too many ideas to produce, it\u2019s that I try to produce all of them at once so my progress is very very slow. My curiosities are mostly about my interests, I like making personal projects regarding music, philosophy, animation, politics, even sports. Generally speaking, I like to learn more about things I already know and furthering my knowledge on subjects before progressing deeper and deeper into a field and then trying to make my own things from there.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nHell no. If I was forced to take a leadership position, my first act would be to abolish the position. I simply believe that people should be allowed to act upon their own instincts and to make their own decisions for the betterment of the group as a whole.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nAs a kid I wasn\u2019t but I\u2019ve gotten much better as I\u2019ve grown older, I generally think I\u2019m pretty graceful on my feet and I\u2019ve got solid hand eye coordination. Probably my best skills are with my hands, I\u2019ve been able to do things from going 7/7 from three in the park on NBA 2K, to learning all of juris combos in SF6, to even just getting all 999 moons in Mario odyssey. Long story short, I got good thumbs basically and that\u2019s my big thing lol\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI love making music. Used to play guitar when I was really young but the strings broke. Now I just compose music on my computer. Usually it\u2019s heavy on interpolating existing tracks and turning it into a beat that I can rap on. Most of the stuff I take is from old obscure queercore bands, anarcho-punk bands like against me, or just general hard-rock like QOTSA. Usually once I get the track itself, I tweak aspects of it until I get something new, (for example, raising the guitar pitch up an octave, changing the bass\u2019s distortion level, adding a brass section, replacing a drum solo w a beat drop, you get the picture)\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI usually view the past as something that I want to let go of and forget but can\u2019t no matter how hard I try, I absolutely live in the present and live in the moment, and I view the future as something that is both extremely hopeful, but also impending with sobering reality.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI try to help people in any way I can because that\u2019s just the right thing to do. What\u2019s the upside for me *not* helping out people I like? Even if I don\u2019t know someone, worst case scenario I make someone\u2019s life easier and it makes me sleep a lil easier at night.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIt\u2019s funny, it would make shit a lot easier, but at this point, I\u2019ve come to terms that rationality as a whole is basically a lost concept and that life\u2019s easier when you just go with the flow. I\u2019ve always been a logical person at my core, but my logic is seemingly different than that of most people.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": " \n\n**Questionnaire**\n\n1. What\u2019s your biggest fear? \n\nProbably falling into an endless black void and there being no hope, just falling into my definite death while not being able to do anything about it. I always fear there being no hope and me not being able to do anything about it. Another example of a big fear I have is death where there is no god, just nothing. It makes me feel very depressed to think that that\u2019s a possibility. I\u2019d rather go to hell than after death just not existing.\n\n2. What\u2019s your biggest desire? \n\nI have this vision of how I want my life to turn out.\n\nI want to get a job that's fun then save up enough money to move into a new house, have kids and go on exciting adventures with them and then when I\u2019m older I want to see my kids talk about how great of a dad I was.\n\n3. What are you \u2018\u2019the best\u2019\u2019 at? \n\nDefinitely reading through people's lies/intuition and my empathy. I don\u2019t even always express my empathy, I just \u201cknow\u201d how people feel. It\u2019s as if when they feel a certain emotion I feel it rub off on me.\n\n4. How do you see yourself right now? \n\nI actually don\u2019t know as I often don\u2019t pay attention to myself in the present moment and only imagine myself in the future.\n\n5. How do you see yourself 5 years from now? \n\nI\u2019ll probably still be living with my parents until I save enough money to get a house and then go on from there.\n\n6. How do you express yourself? \n\nThrough my identity. I love learning stuff about myself. Even as a kid doing simple things like filling out a paper and saying something like \u201cWhat\u2019s your ethnicity\u201d or similar things like that made me excited.\n\n7. How do you feel about those near you (family, friends)? \n\nFamily- It\u2019s very complicated, I have ptsd from them so I don\u2019t talk to them a lot.\n\nFriends-  They\u2019re cool but as rude as this sounds I do have one friend that is \u201cugly\u201d and I\u2019ve considered not being friends with him due to that. I have problems with people who stick out in a \u201cbad\u201d way and often treat them badly. I don\u2019t know why I do this and I\u2019m trying to be better about it. It\u2019s like I have a pre-set list of things someone needs to do in order for me to feel positive things about them.\n\n8. How do you feel about strangers? \n\nI don\u2019t care much about them as long as they aren't causing a ruckis.\n\n9. How do you view change/uncertainty? \n\nAs long as I know before I\u2019m fine with it but if not then I\u2019ll be pretty angry and confused by why I wasn't informed about the change.\n\n10. How do you make decisions? \n\nI make decisions by first looking at the outcomes of my actions and then going on from there.\n\n11. How do you solve logical problems? \n\nBased on concrete evidence I have, not from  online sources that have unknown accuracy but from actual facts.\n\n12. How do you deal with your emotions? \n\nIt really depends on which emotion, when I\u2019m unhealthy I usually have multiple stages first, I usually cry for a while and then I become pretty emotionless, lastly I lash out and become very aggressive and judgemental.\n\n13. What drives you in life? What do you look for? \n\nAesthetic tradition and love.\n\n14. What do you hope to accomplish in your life? \n\nI want to be remembered by my future grandchildren etc as a very legendary man that they look up to.\n\n15. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you? \n\nI avoid being someone I\u2019m not. I hate being controlled or in a system and feel an internal flame spark when someone tries to change who I am.\n\n16. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself? \n\nI simply do not want others to see my physical flaws, I want others to only see me at my best. I see both the ugly part of myself and the normal parts unlike others.\n\n17. Describe how you experience each of: \n\na) Anger;  A mini flame starts growing in my heart until I flip out.\n\nb) Shame; I feel both mad at myself and others and need alone time or I\u2019ll become very aggressive.\n\nc) Anxiety I feel stiff and can only stay still or I\u2019ll feel very alarmed.\n\n18. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? \n\nYes, I was muslim for a while and hated it. I prayed to Allah everyday and begged him for mercy when I lied even if it was over something small. Eventually I got fed up with the un answered prayers and dropped religion entirely.\n\n19. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? \n\nI want a job that I find fun. I find the idea of an office job hellish and need a job where I can find at least minimum excitement or entertainment.\n\n20. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n\nPretty refreshed but I would be very antisocial at the end and become shy in social situations, I might also become bored and miss my family and friends.", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hey.\n\nI\u2019ve been depressed for as long as I can remember, and it must have affected my personality, but I\u2019ll try to be as objective as possible. I\u2019ll also try to include both \u2014 bad and good traits.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve always been a quiet and shy person. I kindergarten, I never talked to others; mostly, I spent time drawing or reading somewhere in the darkest corner. I never felt a connection with any of the kids, or anyone for that matter, and I mostly looked down upon those screeching kids. Once, I remember overhearing my parents talking about me, saying they wished to know what\u2019s going on in my head since I never speak (unless I have to, which didn\u2019t \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 happen often). Oh, and it also makes me remember how my mom always showed me those funny cat videos; I got really sad because the videos were old, and the cats must surely have been dead lol. Basically, I always felt like the only person with open eyes, the only person who\u2019s actually using a brain. I always felt disconnected from everyone. \n\n(You\u2019re allowed to call me cringe, but this just how I feel.)\n\nAnyhow, in any group project, I always do my own thing; in that case, I let someone else take the lead. I have no desire to lead a bigger group. However, I absolutely hate it when someone interferes into the thing I\u2019m doing (not talking about my overall hatred for group projects). I hate deadlines, and overall, I tend to not dwell on the future much; I also often leave things for the last moment. But then again, I don\u2019t expect much from a life, so I stopped making plans for the future. I feel apathetic towards most people and have no desire to please them. I mostly do not care about friendship or a genuine connection. I do forgive easily, though, mostly because it\u2019s always better to have friends in school for many reasons. In that case, I can be very goal-oriented. \n\n(I\u2019m also a socially awkward loser, welll\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.)\n\nI prefer observing and analyzing over actually doing something. I have a very-laid back personality, and I can be quite lazy. I am very sarcastic, and I have a tendency to suppress emotions and thoughts, leading to sudden emotional outbursts. I get easily frustrated and anxious. I hate it when people won\u2019t listen to the logic point and instead rely on their emotions. I distrust people in general. I used to be a perfectionist, but now I mostly don\u2019t care. I have always been attracted to things like theories, unsolved crime, philosophy, poetry, classical music, abstract things, art, stuff like that. I know I can be selfish. I\u2019m quite cynical and hold a strong opinion about pretty much everything. I daydream a lot. I also recently realized I had unconsciously made a very detailed profile of everyone. I can\u2019t help but take criticism very personally, even if it\u2019s clearly objective. \n\nPeople always, if that helps somehow, tell me that I remind them of Victor (used to be Vanya) from The Umbrella Academy.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to say, but if there\u2019s something else you need to know, just write it in the comments. \n\nThanks, guys.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

I am always doing something by myself and I don't want others to interrupt me, I want to be left alone\n2.

Now I am a bit better I can remember approximate dates since I have a framework that I can use to put history events in. The framework is the existence of the universe and how the universe changed till the day we are in, I can only remember dates and numbers when they are put into an important context\n4. another example is stories, whenever I read a story it is hard for me to recall dialogues or events unless I link them to some concept, for example if there is no way to do something except by doing X or Y, and the character did X instead of Y I can remember that. But if there are multiple ways of doing something and the character did it in a certain way, details were the hardest to recall for me.\n5.

Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m 18 years old and I\u2019d probably describe myself as a gender nihilist, but realistically I\u2019m probably just gender-fluid. At my core I\u2019d describe myself as an individualist, and I\u2019m rly into philosophical shit like Emma Goldman and stirner, things like that. I\u2019m pretty quiet, blunt, sardonic, but also probably mask that way too much in order to placate people while slowly resenting them and myself. I absolutely hate being controlled by something or someone. I either care too much about people or don\u2019t really care what they think at all depending on how well or what I personally think of them. I generally play therapist for my entire family.

She still struggles to accept my sexuality and basically just doesn\u2019t acknowledge it despite me coming out twice, but we get along well as long as I constantly validate her own problematic relationships, which I\u2019m fine with doing. Also forced me to go to college from home at a local university because she was worried bc I was autistic, and also had a very clear set goal for me and my future career that I wasn\u2019t necessarily on board with. My father was mostly passive and engaged with my sister who played college basketball, and really only started to try and connect with me as a teenager. Most of the time it\u2019s him trying to talk about pro wrestling with me, even though we don\u2019t really see eye to eye on that either, but I at least appreciate the attempt, but I can also tell he\u2019s miserable. My parents also hate each other and usually have monthly disputes, quarterly quarrels, and biyearly blowups.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n\nI would feel wonderful. I really never get any alone time and feel at peace with myself when I can just be myself without worrying that someone\u2019s going to judge me.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed being active, especially as I\u2019ve gotten fitter as I\u2019ve become more adult, and I\u2019ve always been down for any form of sport, or even just working out. It\u2019s become somewhat routine for me, I obviously don\u2019t want to do it all the time, but I feel much better after doing it. I\u2019ve always enjoyed video games for as long as I remember, for a relatively weird kid, it was oftentimes my only sanctuary in a world where I didn\u2019t necessarily fit in.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would consider myself a pretty curious individual. It\u2019s not necessarily that I have too many ideas to produce, it\u2019s that I try to produce all of them at once so my progress is very very slow. My curiosities are mostly about my interests, I like making personal projects regarding music, philosophy, animation, politics, even sports. Generally speaking, I like to learn more about things I already know and furthering my knowledge on subjects before progressing deeper and deeper into a field and then trying to make my own things from there.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nHell no. If I was forced to take a leadership position, my first act would be to abolish the position. I simply believe that people should be allowed to act upon their own instincts and to make their own decisions for the betterment of the group as a whole.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nAs a kid I wasn\u2019t but I\u2019ve gotten much better as I\u2019ve grown older, I generally think I\u2019m pretty graceful on my feet and I\u2019ve got solid hand eye coordination. Probably my best skills are with my hands, I\u2019ve been able to do things from going 7/7 from three in the park on NBA 2K, to learning all of juris combos in SF6, to even just getting all 999 moons in Mario odyssey. Long story short, I got good thumbs basically and that\u2019s my big thing lol\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI love making music. Used to play guitar when I was really young but the strings broke. Now I just compose music on my computer. Usually it\u2019s heavy on interpolating existing tracks and turning it into a beat that I can rap on. Most of the stuff I take is from old obscure queercore bands, anarcho-punk bands like against me, or just general hard-rock like QOTSA. Usually once I get the track itself, I tweak aspects of it until I get something new, (for example, raising the guitar pitch up an octave, changing the bass\u2019s distortion level, adding a brass section, replacing a drum solo w a beat drop, you get the picture)\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI usually view the past as something that I want to let go of and forget but can\u2019t no matter how hard I try, I absolutely live in the present and live in the moment, and I view the future as something that is both extremely hopeful, but also impending with sobering reality.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI try to help people in any way I can because that\u2019s just the right thing to do. What\u2019s the upside for me *not* helping out people I like? Even if I don\u2019t know someone, worst case scenario I make someone\u2019s life easier and it makes me sleep a lil easier at night.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIt\u2019s funny, it would make shit a lot easier, but at this point, I\u2019ve come to terms that rationality as a whole is basically a lost concept and that life\u2019s easier when you just go with the flow. I\u2019ve always been a logical person at my core, but my logic is seemingly different than that of most people.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hello everyone,\nSo I recently took a test about the 16 personalities, which my brother showed to me, to find my personality.

{"submission": " 1. What\u2019s your biggest fear?  Probably falling into an endless black void and there being no hope, just falling into my definite death while not being able to do anything about it. I always fear there being no hope and me not being able to do anything about it. Another example of a big fear I have is death where there is no god, just nothing. It makes me feel very depressed to think that that\u2019s a possibility. I\u2019d rather go to hell than just not existing.   2. What\u2019s your biggest desire? I have this vision of how I want my life to turn out.  I want to get a job that's fun then save up enough money to move into a new house, have kids and go on exciting adventures with them and then when I\u2019m older I want to see my kids talk about how great of a dad I was.  3. What are you \u2018\u2019the best\u2019\u2019 at?  Definitely reading through people's lies/intuition and my empathy. I don\u2019t even always express my empathy, I just \u201cknow\u201d how people feel. It\u2019s as if when they feel a certain emotion I feel it rub off on me.  4. How do you see yourself right now?  I actually don\u2019t know as I often don\u2019t pay attention to myself in the present moment and only imagine myself in the future.   5. How do you see yourself 5 years from now?  I\u2019ll probably still be living with my parents until I save enough money to get a house and then go on from there.  6. How do you express yourself?  Through my identity. I love learning stuff about myself. Even as a kid doing simple things like filling out a paper and saying something like \u201cWhat\u2019s your ethnicity\u201d or similar things like that made me excited.   7. How do you feel about those near you (family, friends)?  Family- It\u2019s very complicated, I have ptsd from them so I don\u2019t talk to them a lot.  Friends- They\u2019re cool but as rude as this sounds I do have one friend that is \u201cugly\u201d and I\u2019ve considered not being friends with him due to that. I have problems with people who stick out in a \u201cbad\u201d way and often treat them badly. I don\u2019t know why I do this and I\u2019m trying to be better about it. It\u2019s like I have a pre-set list of things someone needs to do in order for me to feel positive things about them.   8. How do you feel about strangers?  I don\u2019t care much about them as long as they aren't causing a ruckus.  9. How do you view change/uncertainty?  As long as I know before I\u2019m fine with it but if not then I\u2019ll be pretty angry and confused by why I wasn't informed about the change. A lot of times if its a super big change and I'm not told about it at least a couple months in advance I'll become very moody.  10. How do you make decisions?  I make decisions by analyzing all the possible outcomes of the decision I'm going to make.  11. How do you solve logical problems?  Based on concrete evidence I have, not just from online sources but from actual facts I can take at face value.  12. How do you deal with your emotions?  It really depends on which emotion, when I\u2019m unhealthy I usually have multiple stages first, I usually cry for a while and then I become pretty emotionless, lastly I lash out and become very aggressive and judgmental.  13. What drives you in life? What do you look for?  Aesthetic, tradition and love.   14. What do you hope to accomplish in your life?  I want to be remembered by my future grandchildren as a very legendary man that they look up to.   15. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you?  I avoid being someone I\u2019m not. I hate being controlled or in a system and feel an internal flame spark when someone tries to change who I am.   16. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself?  I simply do not want others to see my physical flaws, I want others to only see me at my best. I see both the ugly part of myself and the normal parts unlike others.  17. Describe how you experience each of: a) Anger; A mini flame starts growing in my heart until I flip out. b) Shame; I feel both mad at myself and others and need alone time or I\u2019ll become very aggressive. c) Anxiety I feel stiff and can only stay still or I\u2019ll feel very unsafe.  18. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?  Yes, I was muslim for a while and hated it. I prayed to Allah everyday and begged him for mercy when I lied even if it was over something small. Eventually I got fed up with the un answered prayers and dropped religion entirely.  19. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?  I want a job that I find fun. I find the idea of an office job hellish and need a job where I can find at least minimum excitement or entertainment.   20. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?  Pretty refreshed but I would be very antisocial at the end and become extra shy in social situations, I might also become bored and miss my family and friends ", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "hello, this is my first time requesting to be typed with anything in regards to personality tests. i have taken online tests about MBTI, enneagram, and the like but they\u2019ve all been pretty inconsistent to say the least. i have taken the cognitive functions tests and interacted with different people as different types and they have told me different things so im just stuck lmao. ive taken wayy too many tests and im just resorting to asking for insights now because im tired of it \ud83d\ude2d i answered a combined questionnaire as best as i could with a few questions left out and some added in. im open to explaining more about things if anything comes up \n\n\n##Professional\n\n**How do you work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not**\n\nive been told im a pretty hard worker. a few notable notes from my previous supervisors and coworkers (if i can remember correctly):\n- always a valuable member of the team\n- i extend my help towards other people\n- an amiable person and that im very friendly - anytime there\u2019s a new member on the team, i reach out to them and get to know them so they\u2019re comfortable and settled well\n- very meticulous and well organized - i worked at a retail store and their clothes lined up were completely messy. in my mind, everyone else was busy and i immediately knew it would help my team and customers if they were easier to sift through and document. plus i had nothing else to do so i just organized them by color, fabric, size, and put em in their labeled drawers. i found it to be very relaxing and i enjoyed it after a couple of work days but then it was getting boring and i wanted to do something else\n- pretty silly and enjoyable - sometimes i like to use wit and charisma to push Credit Programs and/or build rapport. ive had a few customers recognize me and ask how i am but i dont always have the stimulation to do that\n- ambitious and reliable\n- straightforward and honest\n- has structural thinking, open-minded and mature\n- professional in interactions with customers\n- on-time (imo- mostly, sometimes im like 5mins late but i like to push for punctuality)\n- sometimes ive also been told that whenever im working with other people, they feel like it would be a good work day and comforted by my work ethic\n- assertive and no bs\n- mature-minded and gives good advice\n- sweet, kind, considerate - ive drifted towards people who have had been negatively affected by a customer and i would not be able to get it out of my mind if i dont ask them if they\u2019re ok and make absolute sure of it. i like to talk things out with them because i know that venting would make them feel better in some way\ngood friend - i notice when people are upset, stressed, or just not having a good day. most specifically those that hide it well, i notice that it often gets overlooked by others. from the energy of how they interact with customers, to how secluded they are, to maybe their eyes (sometimes red from crying), just\u2026 idk how to describe it. their energy is just off overall and it\u2019s supported by their behaviors and expressions. i can just feel it most of the time. i know most people are not comfortable with sharing their struggles but despite that, i still ask if they\u2019re alright and investigate lol. usually they spill the tea and i just listen to everything. if not, i drift near them and interact with them hoping that my behaviors will lift their spirits. it will bother me if they leave upset or just more depressed or make other people upset, especially if i had the opportunity to remedy it. but if i cant help them, i usually try to find someone who can or just trust that they will be ok\n- efficient and dedicated\n- positive attitude\n- takes initiative to learn and do well - i studied the pamphlet of one of my job\u2019s Credit Program and i became one of the top performing workers. when i had nothing else to learn, i approached my supervisor and they mentored me\n- inspires and encourages teammates to perform well\n\ni need motivation and stimulation to work well. i dont like being stuck alone in an office for the whole job and everything is quiet and just boring. my mind will wander and i will start automatically looking for something else to do. the jobs ive had were mostly busy work and i enjoyed that. i like being able to be challenged and productive. i like utilizing my mind\u2019s capabilities to achieve things. but after a while, i do prefer to settle down and reenergize. like if my office job was dependent on team effort and i had to interact with others sometimes to do it well, id enjoy that a lot. i like having good coworkers for quality content and playful banter. that\u2019s chef\u2019s kiss for me\n\n**How do you determine the quality of work?**\n\ni think quality of work is equated to quality of content and work ethic. if a person is consistent with a good work process and it\u2019s achieving good results, that\u2019s quality work. if a person is slacking off and finding some way to do their job but still able to do fine, that\u2019s not quality work\n\n**If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that?**\ni ask for help with someone reliable and properly knowledgable. i dont like asking people who are \u201cidks\u201d or \u201ci think this i think that? im not sure\u201d. if im really struggling, i would ask for the step by step again and relay back with what i know in hopes for correction\n\n**How do you measure the success of a job?**\n\ni believe the success of a job depends on what you make of it and what you\u2019re getting. plain and simple. if a job requires you to have a BA in business and you dont have that, go back to school and get it. if a job is only limited to doing the same thing over and over again and you dont like that, perhaps you dont feel successful. then leave and find one that will balance that. it\u2019s not complicated. granted there are considerable factors and that\u2019s up to you, but with what i believe, i think the job should align with your goals and what you want. i also believe a job should provide for you consistently in regards to finance. that is also a determinant for success. i also believe opportunity and consistent improvement contributes to success - personal and/or business-related\n\n**Meta-analysis:**\n\ni know for a fact that most people would not be willing to read all of this so i tried my best to only explain when i feel it\u2019s valuable. i could write more in depth if anyone asks more about it but i just decided to combine the questions and leave some out because i dont think some of them are necessary. i also dont think a typing questionnaire needs to be this convoluted and complicated since these personality tests are meant to be taken with a grain of salt. i still enjoyed it nonetheless cuz im excited to figure it out baha. but also i realized this can help me with job opportunities and self-reflection baha\n\n---\n\n##Logic\n\n**What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?**\n\nim- not sure what you mean by whole. whole of what exactly? if it\u2019s like a whole of a cake and part of a cake, then the parts are equivalent to the whole because it\u2019s.. cake\n\n**What does \"logical\" mean? What is your understanding?**\n\ni dont know how else to explain logic. to be logical is to utilize objective facts and solve problems through reasoning and deduction. it\u2019s on a fundamental principle of true vs false rather than good vs bad\n\n**What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.**\n\nhierarchy is like the food chain: there will always be a bigger predator feeding on smaller prey unless you\u2019re the top of the animal kingdom. hierarchy is a system of people or things in relation to status or value. such as the food chain analogy: a mountain lion can eat a coyote, a coyote will eat a rabbit, a rabbit will eat berries. as a society, we naturally follow hierarchies. whether it\u2019s a social hierarchy or personal hierarchy or even business hierarchy\n\n**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\ni cant tell you how much i value efficiency. it drives me crazy when something is not efficient or just not being as productive as it can be. when a system is just not working, it irks me so much that i feel the need to just step in and fix it but oftentimes i dont because i try not to look like a bitch ;; and then i complain and vent later lol. i also strive to be productive. i like having mental stimulation and productivity just feels like it keeps my mind sharp and working. however, i dont always want to be productive. i value my free time just as much because it takes me a long time to recharge after a heavily exhausting day\n\n**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nim very methodical when it comes to planning and strategizing. i cant really explain it well because it happens so naturally in my head but i like to make sure i have all the information before devising anything so that it\u2019s all accounted for. there was a time when i had to organize a themed event for an online community. i first coordinated with the owner about the theme and what month he wanted to host it on. then i was given a calendar to organize and give to the individual team. i asked about time, members, activities, talked to different team members, scheduled meetings, etc. overall i was able to do it all within a few weeks which is faster than the usual time i was given. i also find it easier to digest when everything is sectioned and into parts\n\n**Meta-analysis:**\n\nagain, i cut out some questions because i just dont see how it\u2019s relevant or necessary. this section just seems random to me, idk why lol. it went from \u201chow are you at work?\u201d to \u201cwhat is a whole?\u201d LOL im going to start picking a few questions from each section because this is way too long\n\n---\n\n##Assertion?\n\n**Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?**\n\ni dont press people nor do i find it necessary to do so. it\u2019s indecent and there\u2019s just no reason to do it. if you can achieve a goal without aggravating anyone, then that use of tact is pretty impressive since most people think being a villain is entertaining. unless pressing people is necessary to gain information, i think there are better ways to do so. for me, i have no ill motives but if im emotionally charged, then that may go out the window lol. nonetheless, i always strive to be patient and use words carefully. i believe a goal can be achieved through sound means\n\n**How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?**\n\nim more often than not, hyper-independent. i dont intentionally go out of my way to charm or manipulate others to get what i want. most often i actually dont really know what i want. i like to go with the flow with things and stay on the sidelines watching things happen. but if, for example, i have a specific vision i want to achieve - i will sometimes do other people\u2019s work to achieve that. if something isnt the way i want it, i may do it myself. or if i want something to be successful like a project or an event with a team, i will work hard and consistently check on updates to make sure everything is going as planned. i will coordinate with others and talk to them if they have any trouble or i will work with them to finish something together. sometimes when im in a leadership position and im working with lazy team members, i will delegate and tell them what to do. if they arent pulling their weight, ill usually tell them \u201chey id appreciate it if you\u2019d finish this. if you need help working on it, ill help you. is there something you dont understand?\u201d but in my mind id get a little annoyed. if they are just not doing anything, i will tell a teacher or professor because i am not about to do more work than i have to\n\n**How do you deal with opposition? What methods do you use to defend your interests?**\n\nwhen it comes to opposition, im generally a passive neutral person. i dont prefer to argue and i dont like wasting my energy on people who are not willing to understand or just spew shit to win. it\u2019s just dumb lol. i also dont like making potential enemies. like i literally have none in my life and i like to keep it that way if possible. i also think everyone has their opinion on things but if i ask you why you think something is dumb, you better have a solid reason for it. like i hate raisins, and if your counterargument is that you think it tastes good then that\u2019s not a solid reason. that\u2019s just your opinion clashing with mine and that is an agree to disagree solution\n\nhowever, if it\u2019s about personal things - i get deeply offended when someone assumes im dumb or incapable of understanding or doing things. i had a friend that just automatically assumes i dont know anything and tells me things i already know. i even told them that it\u2019s based on trauma and experiences in my life and they just dont seem to comprehend how it affects me. at that point, i just cut it off if communication isnt working. it was hard because i truly valued them in other ways and my mind began to wither - i wanted to find what went wrong n all that and i just overthink. sometimes itd come to the point where id even compromise my own beliefs and thoughts just because i dont like to have discord in my relationships. it takes me a good while to move on. i had to talk about it with someone because it\u2019s just a lot more difficult for me to process everything on my own. so i need to rant or vent\n\n**When do you think it's ok to occupy someone's space? Do you recognize it?**\n\noccupy someone\u2019s space? like personal space? i think respect is important if that\u2019s the topic of this question, but if you\u2019re a friend then idk what personal space is\n\n**Do others think you are a strong-willed person? Do you think you have a strong will?**\n\nmany people have told me i have a strong resilience - particularly emotional. i 100% believe it is true due to past experiences and the consistent intensity of them. i wont disclose too much personal information, but i have considered many dark things and for some reason, i just could not find the will to inflict more pain on myself. some part of me wanted to live and i found that no matter how deep i fell, my eyes have always found a way to look up and see the light. because of those experiences in my life, i have always believed that consideration and kindness is important. to understand your own pain and resonate it with others is to also understand compassion and practice empathy. everyone deserves to be happy\n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nif it\u2019s an important decision then id take a long time to consider making a decision. i want to be thorough and make sure i understand the positives and negatives. sometimes id write it down or illustrate so that i can physically process my thoughts. oftentimes though, id want to make a decision as much as possible because i dont like dwelling on thinking too long. but sometimes when ive made a decision, id wonder what wouldve happened if i said otherwise or chose something else. sometimes if it\u2019s just a small thing, im often really lazy to think about it so i wait until im in the right mind to make a decision lol\n\n**Meta-analysis:**\n\n[answer to meta-analysis because im lazy]\n\n---\n\n##Senses\n\n**How do you satisfy your physical senses? What examples can you give? What physical experiences are you drawn to?**\n\ni loooveeee to listen to music and quiet atmospheres and white noise. i have tactile-auditory synesthesia so music is just more enhanced for me because i feel the sensations. like when i listen to \u201cHow Far I Will Go\u201d from Moana, i literally smell the ocean and feel the sensations of the ocean breeze. it\u2019s phenomenal to me lol. i also love the sound of rain sprinkling on wooden surfaces as well as keyboard sounds. other things i like are fidget toys because i just feel the need to continue pressing on things if they feel satisfying. i also like swimming in warm pools like bathtubs. it just feels super relaxing and it just eases my mind. i also have a hobby with fragrances, i like smelling different notes and blends but nothing pungent like cigarettes. another thing is architecture. i would be super immersed in cathedrals or art museums because my mind just wanders and starts imagining different things. i tend to start analyzing and appreciating such visually appealing works and go on rants about them\n\n**Tell us how you'd design any room, house or an office. Do you do it yourself, or trust someone else to do it? Why?**\n\ni dont design rooms lol. im too lazy ;; i will want a decently clean and organized room though, i dont like having too much of a mess. if i had the financial freedom to design my room, id want it to be presentable and visually appealing ofc\n\n**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form?**\n\ni am very clumsy and often lose things. i used to have a good amount of self-awareness when i was a kid because i did martial arts and dance but that all vanished when i stopped. ever since then, ive always been clumsy baha. id bump my limbs against surfaces, trip, not notice things in the way, bump things into other things, drop stuff.. etc. i have butterfingers ;; i cannot seem to hold onto things for my life despite being a careful person. i also tend to put stuff in one place and then forget about it. im one of those people that have their glasses on their head and try to find them. or when i have the tv remote in my hand and actively searching for it. it\u2019s ironic though because im really good with intricate things. i know how to sew and pull tiny splinters out of skin. my brother would always come to me whenever he\u2019d have wood stuck in his fingers and id always pull it out. or when i need to gift wrap things, my parents would tell me to do it because im so perfectionistic and clean with wrapping em. i had to tie a knot with very limited slack with thread and i was able to do it\n\n---\n\n##Emotions\n\n**How do you express your emotions? Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?**\n\ni dont really know how to explain this because it\u2019s been a while since ive emotionally expressed myself enough to notice. if i were to describe it best, people have told me im a very genuine person and when it comes to things i care about, im quite passionate and engaged. if someone does something well done and it\u2019s worthy of praise, ill absolutely compliment them and ask them about it so they feel appreciated. when im angered, im generally cool-headed so i dont lash out but you can certainly hear it and notice it. if im irritated, you will notice but i usually find a way to remedy so that it doesnt resort to lashing out. if im competitive, then yes i certainly will be using profanities and moving around because im just that engaged with whatever im playing. if im sad, i will feel sad but move on because i dont feel it too intensely. i have to really experience emotions intensely to express them and im not an animated person so i cant really describe it well lol\n\n\n**Are you able to change your demeanor in order to interact with your environment in a more or less suitable way? How do you determine what is suitable?**\n\ni do change the way i act when im around people. it always varies. i just adapt to the environment im in and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to understand my true self lol. when im around spontaneous people, i become spontaneous and jovial. when im around quiet and secluded people, ill be that way. when im around angry people, ill feel stressed and drained and leave the room. in regards to suitability, i always make sure to pay attention during instructions. when it comes to work, ill always put professionalism first but im not averse to having fun either way. \n\n---\n\n##Morality\n\n**How do you know that you are a moral person?**\n\ni dont have the energy to explain this but ill leave some messages regarding morality ive msged to people before - and yes, these are from me. please dont assume i copied them from online they\u2019re from real conversations ive had with people ;;\n\n\u201cdont hope for your mom as a person, hope for her progress. progress is always moving unless she decides to stay the same. you\u2019ll have less disappointments that way\u201d\n\n\u201cpeople dont realize that being alive and surviving is a feat in itself. another year you live is another year you have have survived the darkness. imo it\u2019s another way of saying you\u2019re strong enough to not let anything stop you from going on. that is courageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cdont be afraid to cry. if the body\u2019s natural instinct is to shed tears, then let it. it wants to relieve whatever pain is being shoved down your heart. and because it\u2019s trying to find relief, it knows very well that you do not deserve to feel such a great pain. you should allow it to take care of itself just as you should yourself. why? because it\u2019s natural and that is a true form of love. take care of your mind, your body, and heart - cherish its union for it is inclined to express itself in its most natural state of being.\u201d\n\n\u201csir- practice putting your own mental health and spiritual needs first before helping others. think of it as the airplane analogy: you first put your own oxygen mask on before helping others do the same. you cant help another person if you\u2019re descending into a losing battle. neglecting that will offer desperation, not proper reciprocation. there\u2019s a difference, so be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cfrom reading your message you are a compassionate person. you are genuine in your companionship and find happiness in sharing kindness with others. you offer to be a pillar for others even when your own is struggling. oftentimes people like that find themselves alone because they offer so much to others that they are left with almost none for themselves. i see that you\u2019re already aware that you are also a person well deserving of the same care. that is good. strength lies in the courage to speak up and reach out for help in times of vulnerability\u201d\n\n**Someone you care about is acting distant to you. How do you know when this attitude is a reflection of your relationship?**\n\nit\u2019s evident in our interactions and their behaviors. when a friend is acting distant to me, i think back on our previous conversations and arguments beforehand. anything that might have ticked them off or caused a quick change in behavior will be a clear indicator for me. on top of that, when i attempt to do things we used to do before and they dont express the same enthusiasm or interest in entertaining it, i find something wrong. it may be something about me that\u2019s bothering them and remaining unspoken. i also notice it when they are clearly acting normal with other people but not as much around me. but also, it\u2019s just the energy they give off or their body language. they may stand further away from me or their words may be simple and uninterested\n\n---\n\n##Connections\n\n**How do you interpret the following statement: \"Ideas don't need to be feasible in order to be worthwhile.\" Do you agree or disagree, and why?**\n\ni completely agree. i dont think ideas should have a tangible plan, just a spark of inspiration for something can lead to that in the long run when opportunity presents itself for it to be possible. i studied music production back in 2020 and oftentimes i find potential artists writing random things and later going back to it to create something. ideas are generated through brainstorming and brainstorming is an integral part of any plan. when you\u2019re in that stage, you dont really think about ideas being feasible. you think about generating as much as you can so that you can discuss it and entertain it for a track of thought or inspiration. afterwards, you may immediately start thinking whether it\u2019s feasible or not and go from there. however if it\u2019s regarding something immediate and needs realistic standards, then you\u2019ll need more time to consider things before presenting ideas that are feasible and worthwhile\n\n**Describe your thought process when relating the following ideas: swimming, chicken, sciences. Do you think that others would draw the same or different connections?**\n\nmy mind first went to chickens and then swimming and then i thought of ducks and surface tension and then i thought of chickens swimming on water. chickens can swim on water like ducks. they float and paddle their legs. then it made me wonder how surface tension works with their feathers. chicken feathers are different than duck feathers. so now im curious about that lol. i think others may draw the same connections. it\u2019s pretty straightforward. if not, id be surprised and interested to know what they thought of it\n\n**How would you summarize the qualities that are essential to who you are? What kind of potential in you has yet to be actualized and why?**\n\ni believe everyone ive met can agree im a pretty sweet and kind person. most often i get the words silly, goofy, and weird from all of my friends. but also the hinted description of wise and mature-minded. ive gotten \u201cold-soul\u201d from others as well as mysterious. i think the quality that is most essential to who i am is compassion. ive never heard anyone tell me im not an enjoyable and compassionate person. im also a no BS person. that ive always had. i just despise superficiality and phoniness. so whenever a friend is acting stupid and asking me for advice, i will be real and tell them honestly if they\u2019re acting stupid. but of course, i wont be harsh because it\u2019s not about me - im not in the position to vent. im inclined to be straightforward because i believe that is important in any relationship. if i find someone worth standing by with, i will want them to be the best person they can be even if it means scolding them. at the end of the day, i will still express how much i care even if i seem intimidating. id say my leadership qualities have yet to be actualized because i believe i can take on such a role in some cases. i dont like to be first into such a responsibility because i often see it already filled well and i like to be a support person but if direction is needed, i will offer myself to step in\n\n**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nwell- assuming im safe, my mind would start wandering about random things. id first think about whether someone has been here before and search for signs of it. whether it may be foot prints, or any kinds of marks on the walls. id observe any and if there is any sort of strain in them. id hope im safe at least. then id probably give up and lay on the ground looking up at the ceiling. then id start forming shapes from whatever grain is on the ceiling if there is any. if it\u2019s a flat ceiling, then id think about other things that were on my mind that week. if i had to get groceries or something, then id wonder about fruits. then id probably start getting hungry if i havent eaten. if i have, then id probably wonder about what would it taste like if i mixed strawberries, banana, blueberries, and alcohol. like a fruity cocktail. then id start thinking about traveling because ive always wanted to do that. maybe go to somewhere coastal and have a nice vacation. then id fantasize about doing that with someone and then start romanticizing lol. then after a long while, id get bored and wonder when id get out of the room. then id probably fall asleep\n\n**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\ni lived under a rock and was housed in growing up so i would always live in my head because i couldnt go out as much as other people. i would often think about random things and daydream for sure. i also talk to myself sometimes because idk - i guess that\u2019s weird but i also need to verbalize things in order to process correctly. like if someone gave me instructions, i have to relay back what i just heard in order to understand. or if i have emotions that i cant process well in my head, i need to verbalize it in order to process it. most often i digest things in my mind before anything lol. sometimes im not aware of my surroundings. i cant really say what goes in my head, i feel like it\u2019s difficult to explain lol\n\n---\n\n##Intuition?\n\n**Is there anything that cannot be described with words? What is it? If so, how can we understand what it is if language does not work?**\n\ni think complicated feelings are indescribable. mix of emotions as well can be difficult to explain. for example, bittersweetness or euphoria when someone gifts you something nostalgic and deeply resonant. emotions are a complex thing to put into words. our thoughts and statements are only as articulate as the words we know. not everyone is knowledgable about what words can describe what the body is expressing. dance, for example, is something that cant always be put into words but is easily expressed and understood through movement. something so intuitive can be understood by people perhaps because of the way it illustrates emotions through experimental textures accompanied by music, which also has the same amount of complex textures; just auditory\n\n**In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?**\n\nthis i cannot explain fully either. it\u2019s just an instinctual thing and situational thing. but for example when someone just performed on stage and they are full of adrenaline and joy and the performance is terrible but they didnt notice and they ask you how it was, id say you\u2019d first tell them you enjoyed being there to support the show and that you loved seeing them do whatever it is they did. then afterwards when everything is settled, give your thoughts about the show itself and how terrible it was i guess baha. but the state of a person is always something to consider, if someone is in the right mind and state to accept things. you dont want to say something and have it burst into something complicated and unintentional. like when someone came from work and they\u2019re tired and they did something to tick you off, go to sleep and wait the next day to talk about it with them. when you want things to come across clearly, wait until you have a clear and open mindset\n\n##Other things:\npeople have told me that i can be tsundere at times and grow aloof or distant. at first glance, i can come off as intimidating or just not approachable. i dont get that as often because id like to think im warm and friendly when im in a good mood lol. i can connect to people who match my energy and just talk about random things. embracing my inner child is important with relationships because i believe it\u2019s a healthy thing to do every so often and the freedom to be stupidly silly around friends my age is a big contrast compared to growing up at home. both my parents are XXXJs so back then i was very secluded. ofc nowadays i feel free so im in a much better space to be as spontaneous and go out with friends who are as much. although, i will be nervous if we just randomly go somewhere out of range like a venue two hours away. also, idk i find people who are spontaneous just super fun to be around. they\u2019re just entertaining and interesting people lol\n\n**Meta-analysis:**\n\nhonestly the first time i saw this questionnaire i was mortified baha. ive already taken wayy too many personality tests and they were all different with little consistencies. i hoped to just settle with ISFP but this is my first time getting typed so im just dying to know what it is so i can be satisfied and done ;; i dont want to have any more doubts but that sounds pretty idealistic huh? the complexity of personalities will always be as complicated as they are but, for my sake, i just want to know \ud83d\ude2d", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}

I need to be 100% sure I am competent enough to freely start a new task. That's the main reason why I procrastinate. But I also have ADHD so this might also be the reason \n- I overcomplicate my life by overthinking things and taking a route that is very complicated when there is a much easier way to do things \n- I love knowing things for sure. I hate it when I can't get closure on a topic that's bothering me \n- When I was in a very bad mental state, I started overanalizing everything. I was trying to get a hold of what was going on. I was trying to regain control over the situation by finding what was going on and why it was happening, but I couldn't come to any closure \n- I am a decisive person. \n- I like narrowing my options down. This way, it's easier to decide.

I have a ton of boards on Pinterest for literally everything. I also have a playlist for every weather, season, and mood on Spotify.\n- My thought process is slower than other people's, so I come up with a few good ideas instead of many ideas \n- My favorite topic to talk about is people.

{"submission": " \n\n1. Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nYes I did have a religious upbringing and well, it wasn\u2019t fun. A couple years ago I was very religious to the point where every time I \u201csinned\u201d I would immediately picture the \u201chell\u201d that was promised to me if I kept sinning and right when I got home I would cry and beg God to forgive me but I never stopped \u201csinning\u201d. I was basically in a loop of asking God for forgiveness and then doing right what I said what I wasn't going to do over and over again. Another issue I had was that my prayers were not getting answered, no matter how much I prayed I got no answer. One day I just sat there on my bed and said to myself \u201cf4ck it\u201d and stopped praying.\n\n1. What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don\u2019t currently have one since I\u2019m still in school but I\u2019ll probably just become a stay at home dad because the idea of going to an office job or any job that\u2019s super black and white coded makes me want to scream. I\u2019m not unproductive or anything, in fact I\u2019m the opposite. A year ago I had covid and right when I slightly felt better I quickly cleaned my house so I could feel like myself again. \n\n1.

Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nProbably very refreshed energy wise but I kinda go nuts when I stay in my house for too long soo it\u2019s kinda a win-lose situation.\n\n1. What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nThe first and last time I tried sports I was pretty good at it but it\u2019s too much pressure to have everyone count on me to catch a stupid ball made of foam. I also have another issue with sports, the audience screaming really irritates me. like don\u2019t scream at me just because I didn't win a stupid game that nine year olds play on a daily basis. I just can\u2019t take sports seriously and don\u2019t understand why so many people go cuckoo over it.\n\n1. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI have a normal amount of curiosity but if my curiosity can lead me into a dangerous situation    then I won\u2019t act on it. I have lots of ideas but can\u2019t express them into the real world because I can\u2019t draw or do anything that allows me to show off my creativity.\n\n1.

Please explain your answer.\n\nYeah I\u2019m artistic but terrible at art if that makes sense. Like I\u2019ll have these wonderful ideas and then struggle to make them into real things.\n\n1. What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI mainly focus on myself in the future and what I\u2019m going to do next. I always have a mini system in the back of my brain thinking about what I\u2019m gonna do next.\n\n1. How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf I\u2019m in a positive mood I\u2019ll just help them but if not I\u2019ll still help them but while I\u2019m helping them I\u2019ll probably complain about why they couldn\u2019t just do it themselves, yada yada.\n\n1. Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYeah everyone does to an extent.\n\n1. How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery important, when I was a kid, my parents who are arguabely pretty lazy let the house get normally dirty and I would furiously clean the house and think to myself \u201chow unclassy\u201d and \u201cWhat if people came over and saw this mess!\u201d. Another example of a similar situation was when my mom didn't have a job for a certain period of time and then she would complain about not having a lot of money and I would for some reason get really irritated on why she couldn\u2019t just be \"classy\u201d and get a job.\n\n1. Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI hope not..\n\n1. What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI don\u2019t have hobbies that I do everyday but I do like going out in the rain and feeling everything. The cold air touching my skin and the light rain falling on my head always makes me feel good.\n\n1. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI NEED learning environments that provide BOTH logic and fun. I hate black and white environments and usually adapt to them but hate them a lot.\n\n1. How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI break them up into mini tasks inside my head and once I\u2019m done I review everything I did to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything.\n\n1. What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI don\u2019t have any\n\n1. What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nIt makes me uncomfortable to be in messy environments or to be around people I deem as unclassy or don\u2019t fit my internal code of how people should act. I also hate unwanted sexual attention eck.\n\n1. What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nChill-Productive-Happy-Romantic-Traditional-Quick-Thoughtul-Intuitive-Open minded\n\n1. What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nHarsh-Judgmental-Nitpicky-Lazy-Angry-Passive aggressive-Conservative", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I\u2019ve typed and retyped myself and realized there are so many factors that make me mistype myself. To start, I am definitely an introverted MBTI. I have disorders that make it harder to type such as panic disorder, bpd, anxiety (social too), and depression. Here\u2019s my list I\u2019ve compiled of myself that confuses me.\n\n-I would lead groups in school and at work but not in sports. I am a perfectionist and would constantly fix presentations, do things the way I want, neglected the rubric, my mom described me as bull-headed when I was younger, black and white, would lash out at people I was close to, saw things as good versus bad when I was younger, I refuse to drink, smoke and go to parties.\nI would always think about the way my papers/videos will have impact on audience, wouldn\u2019t dance when I was younger because I feared how I looked, would build up emotions and can\u2019t confront people I don\u2019t know well, over time became completely subjective and I don\u2019t believe good versus bad exists anymore, would go out my way to help people. I would ask my mom a bunch of questions when I was very young like \u201cwhy do you do that\u201d or \u201cwhy did you turn that way\u201d, grandparents described me as a thinker, have always channeled emotions through creative writing and was good at it, described by 10th grade teacher as better at creative writing than essays, when I comfort people I have a hard time comforting emotionally and I get awkward so I offer solutions, I was popular when I was younger but I always got bored because I wasn\u2019t similar to them so I ditched them for weirder friends and a quiet life, big procrastinator, I was good at algebra but bad at geometry because it felt less concrete, I prefer starting with a structure and rules and then later interpreting them how I want, I wouldn\u2019t go to sleep until I understood the meaning of life/contemplated the existence of God, unless tested on it, I have a hard time remembering facts to bring up in later discussions, bad when I worked in fast food and under pressure, I don\u2019t want to go to bars or party to meet people, but I like learning about other people 1 on 1 in other settings, I can\u2019t hide my feelings and they always show on my face without me knowing, very interested in material items and brand names but I don\u2019t buy something just because everyone else has it. I naturally would judge people\u2019s looks harshly, but after I was bullied, I could rethink my judgements and find the good in people. \n\nIf it\u2019s too hard to type me, I understand.

{"submission": " \n\n**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am 17 year old female. I came here because I suspect I am probably a ISFP, but I need confirmation from an objective source. I am also sure that my mbti has an fi and te combination due to the fact that personally my fi outbeats my fe. I also might be wrong due to the fact that my understanding of the functions might be wrong in itself. \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nI come from a Christian household, but no one really taught me the specifics. They only gave me a basic overview of the faith. I decided that I wanted to take things into my own hands and study it, but I am a huge procrastinator so it is difficult for me. My reasoning for studying/believing it because I think it is the truth and I want to gain more knowledge to remove my doubts. I also admittedly have an innate fear of leaving my faith.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nIf I were to spend an entire weekend by myself, I would likely feel lonely. I remember when I had quit video games because I wanted to be more productive in my life, and I came back due to the feeling of loneliness it had brought me. I am also kinda contradictory as I dislike interacting with others when it interrupts my plans.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI personally prefer indoor activities. I do not enjoy sports nor I am good at it.  I enjoy drawing, playing videos games, and writing. I can\u2019t think of an outdoor activity I enjoy on the top of my head. It is important to note that I am addicted to playing Roblox and not much else. I cannot try another video game, as I quickly drop it. I am trying to develop hobbies, but I am too busy with school work.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nIt depends on what type of leadership position, as I would be quite nervous leading a room of people, or anything really important. I am unsure if I would be good at it, as I do not have much experience outside of group projects. I would naturally try to be nice to others, but at school I am frustrated when people do not work hard enough or simply give up without trying. I am also a perfectionist and a hard worker, so it frustrates me when people do not meet my standards.\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI am artistic, but I quit seriously doing it due to disappointment with my level of art. I particularly enjoy the anime art style because it is pleasing to the eyes. I believe it is related to the aesthetics of it, as I enjoy aesthetically pleasing things and anime drew me in since I was a child.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI feel it is difficult for me to stay in the present moment because I am always stuck in my head whether it be the past or future. For example, I have a math test tomorrow and I am worried about what grade I shall get for it or I ruminate about past mistakes. My head is full of thoughts that distract me, and I am never truly there.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIt depends on if I am focused on something. Usually, I would comply and help them like when I tutored a student day. I helped them because it is the right thing to do and it is also my obligation. I would be annoyed if it took me off my work.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nEfficiency and productivity are of high importance to me. I believe I try to be too efficient because whenever I try to learn how to do something, I value finding the perfect method even if it doesn\u2019t exist and not actually do the action. Productivity is important to be but I fail to be productive. I do want to be productive but it is difficult for me because I am a procrastinator. It is also difficult because of my schedule changing and having obligations. I also have a lack of sleep due to overthinking.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don\u2019t believe that I am that socially controlling, but I always want things to go perfectly and how I want them to go. I guess I want to be in control and decide everything? I am unsure.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\n1. I enjoy Roblox because it is fun and it fills my boredom in daily life. I also have been playing it nonstop for 9 years. Yet, I want to quit playing it but it is difficult to since I am addicted and attached to it in an unhealthy way. To me, my brain treats it as a reward and that\u2019s the problem.\n\n2. I enjoy drawing because I like drawing cute images, and it isn\u2019t that difficult to enact.\n\n3. I enjoy writing for a purposeful way. It is difficult for me to write due to the fact that I am so focused on making it perfect and tidings things up. I think it\u2019s hard because it is important to me unlike the other ones. It also requires learning the fundamentals and techniques that go into character, plot, etc. You understand a sense of what goes behind the scenes.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nMy learning style consists of a hands-on approach. I usually understand things quicker than my classmates, thus actually doing it connects the dots. It affirms my understanding of my topics. I am unsure what I struggle the most with, maybe reading because I have more of a say, so I\u2019d get more distracted. I prefer a class involving logic or creativity. It is difficult for me to memorize things, especially the fact that those classes are useless to me. Spanish for example, I didn\u2019t bother to memorize anything due to the fact that I am simply not interested in Spanish. I would say logic or creativity because in ELA, it is fun to analyze characters and see how they function. It is like connecting all the dots in your head and putting it into a well-founded essays that others can understand.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nIt depends on the importance of the assignment. I naturally break my day into parts automatically and forge my own internal plan, but it is hard to act upon it due to procrastination and other factors. It kinda sucks. I am unsure if I am good at strategizing but I would lean towards yes.\n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nThere is not much of a difference between my aspirations in life, whether it is professionally or personally. For me, being professional albeit getting a stable job, a family, the usual wouldn\u2019t make me happy. Thus, I am a huge dreamer. I seek a purpose in life, and hope to make my mark onto the world. I hope to inspire and help people through using my passion of making stories. I do not want to die without being unknown, and especially being unsatisfied. I hope to write stories and use Christianity to guide me, as if it is true, then the ultimate act of helping people is through spreading it and its messages.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nMy biggest fear is death. I fear death due to the fact that if I die, then I will not accomplish my goals. Thus, I concluded that in order to stop fearing death, I need to have no regrets. I hate products that take advantage of people and try to use them. I think creating things for the sole benefit of money and instead of helping people is horrible.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI daydream very often. I do not feel very attached to reality, as I lose track what is occurring in front of me and focus on my thoughts. Even focusing on a simple thought causes me to lose awareness of my surroundings. I have been daydreaming since I was a child, and I would not be aware of things right in front of me.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nIt depends on what is on my mind right now. For example, I am focused on MBTI, thus I will focus on trying to figure out what my type is and finding my \u201cgang.\u201d If I am consuming media, I will loop a scene again and again with a character I enjoy. Essentially, it is anything I am interested in.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt depends on the emotion and the event that occurred. If it is a stressful event, I will get a headache and it hurts me. I also feel a disconnect from my inner emotions and the emotions my body is exhibiting to others, as I do not choose to present these emotions. I feel my emotions are important as they are the guideline towards happiness. I also enjoy analyzing my emotions and finding what thought causes my emotions. I am also very sensitive.\n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes, I catch myself agreeing with others views because I am afraid of conflict between the two of us, and losing them as my friend. It is dependent on the topic. I can be blunt but not in a rude way.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI do not break rules often, as I was a very good rule follower. I never casually swore until everyone else had done it. I also do not cheat, and I try to not go against my morals. It is dependent on the authority, if it is oppressive and morally corrupt then yes, but if it is not then I do not think so. I break the rules based on my wants and needs. If I were to cheat it is because it is difficult for me, or if I were to take media, it is because it is easier than consuming it. Yet, I try to refrain from such actions as it goes against my morals.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI\u2019m 18 years old and I\u2019d probably describe myself as a gender nihilist, but realistically I\u2019m probably just gender-fluid. At my core I\u2019d describe myself as an individualist, and I\u2019m rly into philosophical shit like Emma Goldman and stirner, things like that. I\u2019m pretty quiet, blunt, sardonic, but also probably mask that way too much in order to placate people while slowly resenting them and myself. I absolutely hate being controlled by something or someone. I either care too much about people or don\u2019t really care what they think at all depending on how well or what I personally think of them. I generally play therapist for my entire family. Never really felt comfortable in my own skin or expressing myself due to fear of backlash. If I don\u2019t wanna be somewhere you can absolutely tell that I don\u2019t wanna be there.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\n Autism, anxiety, mayyyyybe depression?\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nFine, I guess. My mother\u2019s well intentioned but strict, and has admitted to me she likely has some form of psychological problems. She still struggles to accept my sexuality and basically just doesn\u2019t acknowledge it despite me coming out twice, but we get along well as long as I constantly validate her own problematic relationships, which I\u2019m fine with doing. Also forced me to go to college from home at a local university because she was worried bc I was autistic, and also had a very clear set goal for me and my future career that I wasn\u2019t necessarily on board with. My father was mostly passive and engaged with my sister who played college basketball, and really only started to try and connect with me as a teenager. Most of the time it\u2019s him trying to talk about pro wrestling with me, even though we don\u2019t really see eye to eye on that either, but I at least appreciate the attempt, but I can also tell he\u2019s miserable. My parents also hate each other and usually have monthly disputes, quarterly quarrels, and biyearly blowups.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n\nI would feel wonderful. I really never get any alone time and feel at peace with myself when I can just be myself without worrying that someone\u2019s going to judge me.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed being active, especially as I\u2019ve gotten fitter as I\u2019ve become more adult, and I\u2019ve always been down for any form of sport, or even just working out. It\u2019s become somewhat routine for me, I obviously don\u2019t want to do it all the time, but I feel much better after doing it. I\u2019ve always enjoyed video games for as long as I remember, for a relatively weird kid, it was oftentimes my only sanctuary in a world where I didn\u2019t necessarily fit in.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would consider myself a pretty curious individual. It\u2019s not necessarily that I have too many ideas to produce, it\u2019s that I try to produce all of them at once so my progress is very very slow. My curiosities are mostly about my interests, I like making personal projects regarding music, philosophy, animation, politics, even sports. Generally speaking, I like to learn more about things I already know and furthering my knowledge on subjects before progressing deeper and deeper into a field and then trying to make my own things from there.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nHell no. If I was forced to take a leadership position, my first act would be to abolish the position. I simply believe that people should be allowed to act upon their own instincts and to make their own decisions for the betterment of the group as a whole.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nAs a kid I wasn\u2019t but I\u2019ve gotten much better as I\u2019ve grown older, I generally think I\u2019m pretty graceful on my feet and I\u2019ve got solid hand eye coordination. Probably my best skills are with my hands, I\u2019ve been able to do things from going 7/7 from three in the park on NBA 2K, to learning all of juris combos in SF6, to even just getting all 999 moons in Mario odyssey. Long story short, I got good thumbs basically and that\u2019s my big thing lol\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI love making music. Used to play guitar when I was really young but the strings broke. Now I just compose music on my computer. Usually it\u2019s heavy on interpolating existing tracks and turning it into a beat that I can rap on. Most of the stuff I take is from old obscure queercore bands, anarcho-punk bands like against me, or just general hard-rock like QOTSA. Usually once I get the track itself, I tweak aspects of it until I get something new, (for example, raising the guitar pitch up an octave, changing the bass\u2019s distortion level, adding a brass section, replacing a drum solo w a beat drop, you get the picture)\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI usually view the past as something that I want to let go of and forget but can\u2019t no matter how hard I try, I absolutely live in the present and live in the moment, and I view the future as something that is both extremely hopeful, but also impending with sobering reality.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI try to help people in any way I can because that\u2019s just the right thing to do. What\u2019s the upside for me *not* helping out people I like? Even if I don\u2019t know someone, worst case scenario I make someone\u2019s life easier and it makes me sleep a lil easier at night.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIt\u2019s funny, it would make shit a lot easier, but at this point, I\u2019ve come to terms that rationality as a whole is basically a lost concept and that life\u2019s easier when you just go with the flow. I\u2019ve always been a logical person at my core, but my logic is seemingly different than that of most people.", "clean_guess": "ISFP", "llm_guess": " ISFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": " 1. how attached are you to the concept of emotion? do emotions, values or sentiments often influence your perspectives and decisions?  I\u2019m pretty attached to the concept of emotions but I honestly don\u2019t know if emotions impact my decisions. Like I might change my decision if I feel threatened but other than that idk, although sometimes the aesthetic of something might influence my decision.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. how easy it for you to identify what might bring you pleasure emotionally? is it easy for you to identify what may bring others emotional pleasure?  It\u2019s pretty easy for me to identify how others get emotionally pleasured. As long as I\u2019ve known someone for a month or two \\\\. I can usually have a pretty good sense of their core fears and what makes them happy etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Do you have strong moral standards? What are they and what is their origin?  Yes, well I think at least. I really like to have a classy environment and I\u2019m not talking about super rich butlers and princesses, I'm talking about an environment where people put at least some effort in how they look and talk properly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  4. is it easy for you to accept a moral belief as truth before understanding it completely?  No and people often get irritated by my desire to know \u201cwhy?\u201d and I hate when people say something and don't explain their opinion.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. do the opinions of specific people affect your beliefs, feelings and behaviors more than others might? who are these people and why is this so?  If the people I\u2019m around seem very aggressive then I\u2019ll be more careful with my wording and what beliefs I share so kinda.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  6. do you see your feelings as a part of your identity? why or why not?  Yeah, because it\u2019s literally a trait that all/most human beings have???  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. is it easier for you to process your emotions internally or externally? Internally, I need a long time alone to process how I feel and if I don\u2019t I become VERY aggressive.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. how attached are you to the concept of logical reasoning? do quantifiable data (numbers, statistics, etc.) and systems often influence your perspectives and decisions?  I don\u2019t know man, I just make decisions based on what makes sense. I have trouble answering these logic/emotion based questions because I use both of them a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 9. is it easy for you to make impersonal decisions for the sake of progress?  No, I\u2019m very indecisive and change my mind a lot. I always have doubts, even if I ask other people about their opinions on the decision i\u201dll be just as confused as before.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. what defines a system as effective? is a system considered more effective when it works specifically for you or a group?  An effective system is simply just a system that works. To the second question, yes it des work more when it\u2019s made specifically for the group.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n11. is it easy for you to accept a logical fact as truth before understanding it completely?  No, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a \u201cfact\u201d until I research about it and from my own opinion about it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n12. do the opinions of specific people often affect what you believe to be logical truth? who is this and why is this so?  No  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 13. do you see the idea of logical standards as part of your identity?  Yeah , no one can function without some type of logic.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n14. is it easier for you to process logic-related thoughts internally or externally?  Definitely internally.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n15. do you feel you are better at handling heavy debates or heavy emotional situations?  Uhh in debates I get super angry by the lack of good reasoning people use so probably emotional situations as long as there not about MY emotions.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n16. is it easy for you to pick up and acknowledge certain sensory details in your environment?  I focus mainly on the bigger picture but maybe.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n17. is it easy for you to acknowledge physical changes in your body? do you feel comfortable in your body?  Yes and kinda, I lie to myself by calling myself perfect even though I do so much stuff JUST to feel good about my body. I don\u2019t even consider myself insecure, I just hide my negative physical qualities and go on with my day lying to others and myself by telling them I don\u2019t do anything certain to look good.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n18. do you feel that concepts must be proven with physical details and sensory systems before moving forward with them?  Ehhhhhhhh kinda, like I prefer things to be proven with concrete evidence but that's not always the case so I just have to envision the most probable answers and go on from there.    \n\n19. do you tend to put more of your focus on sensory memories and past experiences or the moment at hand and future physical sensations?  I\u2019m very focused on the future and what I\u2019m gonna do next. I often have a schedule set in my head for what I\u201dm going to do in the day as I don\u2019t like physical schedules because it feels like I\u2019m trapped in them and overall I just need a slightly more flexible routine.

All the creativity I could ever want, perfect mix of roleplay/social, combat/logical/mechanical and seeing how builds that I make or characters that I work hard on come together at the end of the story. Star Wars Armada. It\u2019s just a fun game that takes up a few hours. It\u2019s you, a buddy, you put on some background music and have a good time. It\u2019s why people like football games. Star Wars Legion/Warhammer. Pretty models. Minecraft. Architectural liberation and creative zen. Halo. I like showing that I\u2019m good at something. Games in general, I like playing with buds. For solo player games, I like getting immersed in a good story. Pokemon because of nostalgia. TVs and movies. I just love the creativity and ideas they give me. I like going to the movies because that\u2019s dope as fuck. My gf and I watch masterchef together. I LIKE BLANKIES. COMFY AND WARM.\n\n\nWhat's important to you and why?\n\n\n\tCreativity, freedom, expression, DND, support, for people to be rational and caring and overall not dicks\n\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n\n\tI don\u2019t think I break rules often. I do my best to abide. I think rules should be challenged to make sure that they are right/just and effective at helping either the majority or as many people as they realistically can. But you gotta be constantly challenging rules to ensure they\u2019re within the best interest of the people. I\u2019ll break the rule if I think it\u2019s dumb.\n\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\n\tI\u2019m very curious. I have more ideas than I can commit to/carry out mostly due to motivation and self discipline. My curiosities are about everything.\n\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\n\tYes. I think the hardest aspect for me would be the discipline/having to reprimand people. I think that I would be a very hands on approach and also caring. I would make sure that things get done right even if I have to do it myself. From a worker perspective, I admire that.\n\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\n\tI\u2019m artistic I guess. I majored in cinematography for a while and I liked it. I\u2019m very artistic in the ways that I visualize things. I visualize all my ideas in my head cinematically. I absolutely adore OSTs. When I listen, I just absorb the emotions and elements that their music brings together and will probably create a Dnd character based off of it.\n\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\n\tI have a kinesthetic learning style, followed by visual (my audio processing disorder says no to that audio shit). I struggle learning with teachers that don\u2019t put in effort, people who are monotone and boring, who don\u2019t allow you to ask questions. I struggle with them because if you can\u2019t keep my attention, I\u2019m not gonna bother keeping your information. I prefer logic and creativity. I like logic classes because I find it very easy. I like creativity classes a lot even if it can seem overwhelming at times.\n\n\nWhat is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\n\n\tPina colada by the beach, am I right?

{"submission": "First of all, I just wanted to ask you guys if I am mistyped and I am really unsure about having INTP as my personality type. My Eannegram is 5w6.(I am doing this out of boredom, so feel free to answer me if you're interested. I am not forcing you at all.)\n\nWell, I'll just tell you everything I know about myself because some people and friends have described me in a way that I don't see myself. Lol\n\nWhenever it's the first day of school, I usually initiate conversations with others. I don't know why, but I've noticed that I make friends by simply asking, \"Hey, can I borrow your pen?\" The conversation usually continues unless I sense that they're uninterested or don't want to talk at all. \n\nBasically, I become a part of multiple circles of friends, but I don't get to talk with those who are farther from my seat as much. \n\nI am sometimes noisy, but not loud enough to stand out from other extroverts (Other classmates said im introverted some said im extroverted, which confuses me even more. Or maybe im an extroverted introvert) However, before and after class hours, I become exhausted and often feel the need to sleep or remain quiet unless approached. Some of my friends even recognize that if I am too quiet, there may be something wrong or bothering me. (I'm just tired) \n\nI do have a good sense of humor and sarcasm. I make many of my classmates laugh, and whenever I use sarcasm, I tell them it's just my way of expressing love so they won't overreact and cry about it. My classmates would ask me if I'm mad when I try to greet them back (thats the way I knew I had RBF)\n\nI am very skeptical. I usually ask more than four questions whenever someone tells me a rumor, but that just makes me tell them that we shouldn't assume. Whenever there's enough evidence, I observe more into it and think what may be a reason, if its even worth the time to look into it or i am curious before I could tell them my judgment. I never confirm my assumptions and answers when it involves rumors about people and their relationships because that would just backfire and make me more like the bad guy.  \n\nWhenever I make a decision, I prefer to choose whatever can get me closer to my goals. During group work, if someone says that a member isn't contributing, I suggest removing them from the group, even if they're a close friend. However, if I feel like the person will listen, I may threaten them by saying I'd remove them from the list in a second. I don't usually prefer being a leader because I'm usually lazy, but if I really had to lead the pack, I know I can do it well. Sometimes, most of the members can be a pain in the ass like me. \n\nMost of my friends approach me to talk about their issues, and I just listen. It's entertaining sometimes, but my advice is complete bullshit. Because of that, I know their addresses, relatives, and almost everything about them, but they don't know anything about me. They only know that I have a brother and where my house is, but they have never seen or visited my home. However, I have visited their houses lol. \n\nNow we have research in our class. I don't give a fuck about the panelists' criticism and I sort out their sarcasm from the advice which I think would help me. I literally just want to pass all requirements needed, and I don't usually put effort into it.\n\nI am kind of expressive, I think. I notice that I always smile because of my crush (he's an INTJ), but I also have a neutral face at all times. I have never gotten mad at any of my friends before, but I can cry if I want to, even without a valid reason. Hahaha, maybe my friends are just full of feelers because they notice immediately whenever I try to cry and treat me like a baby. However, my expression isn't true to what I am actually feeling on the inside. I just do it because im bored. \n\nSometimes, when my friends ask me how I feel about my crush, I just freeze up and my brain feels like the Windows error screen. I literally can't find the words to describe my feelings. This also happens when i describe my interactions with my crush to my friends, I'd be making them disappointed when i literally had their attention. (They're really supportive when i know i had no chance to him, based on my observations) \n\nI'm not used to following rules, but if I am the one in control, I may be strict (Id shout and yell at them alot). Sometimes, I don't really listen to their orders and do things on my own. Thank God they have a lot of patience.\n\nI am imaginative, but in a sense that it pertains to realistic scenarios. I don't imagine things like \"What if a unicorn bursts into the bathroom stall I'm in?\" It's amusing to consider such thoughts, but when I'm serious, I strive to keep it as grounded as possible to avoid disappointment.\n\nI don't have many needs, maybe just one or two, but I consider them long-term goals. That's why I don't buy as much unless I really feel like I need it right now. (My mom trained me to be that way since we couldn't always afford things, which made me not expect much stuffs either.) \n\nI can be indecisive; my INTP friend and I literally ask each other when to go back home. I would say 'I don't know' as I prefer letting other people decide if I think they know better.\n\nI can communicate with people through just a signal and even make my one extroverted friend quiet down with just a glare. I advised her to consider her words before speaking as she tends to overshare, unlike me who always keeps the conversation focused on others to avoid talking about myself.\n\nI'm not very organized, but when I feel like my home is messy enough, I fix it. Unfortunately, it tends to get messy again because my mom is an INFP. She doesn't want to cause fights, but she thinks similarly to me. Maybe am spontaneous. I heard my two friends talking and they told each other that I am spontaneous, so...\n\nI don't prefer to follow the crowd; my opinions often oppose those of others, which can lead to arguments, but I don't take them too seriously. Typically, my arguments end within a minute, and I leave the other person with their thoughts. I don't typically initiate an apology during an argument, but if I accidentally hurt someone or invade their personal space, I immediately express my regret.\n\nI usually forget about what happened in the past, which makes me miss out on homework assignments, birthdays of others, and even my own, lol. However, I tend to think more about the present and future.\n\nI am thrilled to experience new things, but when it comes to new interests, I tend to stick with video/photo editing, drawing, and even trying to make games. (maybe someday I'll find a new hobby, but im not really sure.)\n\nI am silly and creative tho, im really sure of it :P \n\nI have 36 friends but i only have 4 close friends \n\nMy mom is infp and my dad is istp.

{"submission": " Hiya! I'm currently typed as an INTP but been having doubts about it as I have been recently typing as ENTP on some tests and I've always related more to ENTP vs INTP when I started getting into MBTI, however I see some aspects of both INTP & ENTP in me and it probably doesn't help that these two types are so similar, ha. I recently typed as 7w8 but have also typed as 8w7 on some enneagram tests if this helps break it down even more. \n\n**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**  \nA: I am currently twenty-three years old and I'm a female. I'm just your typical 20-year-old who likes eating, sleeping, gaming, and being goofy with my friends. I currently attend college and I am working towards an English Degree. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nA: I've been assessed to have ADD and potentially undiagnosed anxiety/autism other than that? Nothing really TOO drastic. I tend to be pretty forgetful and airheaded at times (most likely to do with the ADD lmao) \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nA: I was pretty shy as a child and enjoyed being a homebody. I wouldn't even sleep over at my grandparents house because I was THAT flighty. However, I grew up as a child of divorced parents. I was considered \"popular\" for a while in elementary school but ultimately left that environment due to the toxicity. In Highschool I was considered nerdy, enjoyed watching anime, reading books. But I wasn't \"too nerdy\" to be considered strange/disliked by others. Everyone generally enjoyed talking to me and thought of me to very pleasant and nice to talk to. However, I only ever \"talk\" to people when they address me or it benefits me in some way. Regarding religion, I grew up Christian and loathed it. Didn't like the environment and the people within the church, so I sorta rebelled and now I'm an atheist. \n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**  \nA: I currently work as a Librarian! I enjoy this career as I have a balance between socializing and peaceful moments. I've always loved books so I'm not too fussed about it. I like working with the public and enjoy helping people find their next read, and I love talking about books, especially if its a book I like! \n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**  \nA: I wouldn't be too fussed about spending a weekend by myself, I generally enjoy my alone time. However, if I do get TOO bored I need stimulation/feel the need to be social. If I was given the opportunity to go out to a party or stay home and do something cozy, I think it would really depend on what TYPE of party it is, would it benefit my entertainment? If not, then nah I ain't going. \n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**  \nA: My activities vary! However, some of them consist of: Traveling, Writing, Reading, and Gaming. I enjoy activities where I can get plenty of stimuli where I won't get bored even if it means being lost in my own head at times. I'm decent at sports, I can learn a game pretty quickly and tend to be very good at all areas of things and catch on super quick. Some people like to call me well-rounded and a quick learner. As for outdoor activities, I like gardening LOL. \n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**  \nA: I tend to be very curious and my head is ALWAYS throwing around/coming up with all SORTS of ideas and theories. I love theories about almost anything and I like answering hypertheoretical questions, as most of my interesting conversations started with \"What if/If you...\" For example, I like reading certain details about a favorite character of mine or something that I am interested in and theorize certain outcomes or ideas about said character/thing that are backed up with facts/proof. I'm pretty good at convincing others THE possibilities of my ideas being potentially logical and sound. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**  \nA: I've been in a leadership type position before for work and I thought I was pretty decent at it. I didn't have a lot of experience under my belt, however, I feel like I was a pretty fair and just leader (I was an assistant manager at work) and I enjoyed leading others and even potentially thought about being a Teacher (our greatest leaders in education). However, my style of leadership tends to be more laidback/easy going. However, when work needs to be done, I make sure it gets done. So I tend to be pretty chill but can be serious when needed. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**  \nA: I like to think I am coordinated! However, I can be clumsy at times when I get distracted at times. If we're theoretically speaking and I was forced to multitask, I would do fine. I like working with my hands as I'm always moving them/playing with them. I'm a big hand talker so I'm always throwing my hands around when speaking/expressing myself. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**  \nA: I used to be, some people still think I am but I lost interest in the art world but I do enjoy consuming art be it with my eyes/hands/ears. I LOVE writing (it's my big hobby!) and I enjoy watching people paint/make art and I am ALWAYS listening to music to stimulate my brain. If I had to choose between sitting in quiet room vs a room with music, I would always choose the room with music. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nA: This is a pretty straightforward answer. Past is something to reflect upon when you need to reflect on it. The present is where I like to stay, I like being in the moment of here and now. The future is something that is always shifting and changing, it's not a solid, concrete thing. \n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nA: I help people to just help, I don't mind helping people but I don't like fixing people's problems because I don't want to involved myself in that sorta thing. However, I offer solutions more than help. However, if we're speaking on physical helping (like moving something) then I'm down to help out. However, emotional help? Keep away from me LOL.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**  \nA: Yes, I tend to be a very logical person, however I wouldn't be too upset if there is a hiccup in that said consistency. I like seeing the flaws of things, that's where my analytical side comes in. \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**  \nA: Depends. If I need things right away then I expect people to deliver. I cannot stand when people are more \"slow\" at processing things as I'm a very fast thinker. HOWEVER, I'm also not the MOST productive and effective person either. I guess it's important when it benefits me. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nA: I don't control others for fun, I'm a more laid back type of person. However, If we're speaking on the terms of controlling others via leading, then sure, I control them however, I like people to have their own freedoms/opinions. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nA: My learning style tends to be random factual stuff. I internalize facts and produce them at the most random times. I absolutely HATE studying and would prefer to have classes where I'm able to do what I want and not be constricted to certain things. I like creatives classes but I also like logical classes. I hate memorization (I'm really bad at math...). I thrive in lecture type classes where I am able to focus on what is happening/what I am learning. I hate group-related work but I eventually tough it out and ease into group work.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nA: I'm a BIG procrastinator and wing my projects and improvise as I go. It it helps, I once created random results for a research paper for my college class and passed with an A+ (it was all bs lol) and I tend to write my papers the day they're due. I due better under pressure/in the moment type situations.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**  \nA: I would probably think about all sorts of things, why am I in this room? What would I draw on the walls... Is there a way I can break out of here? Scream? (This would be torture for me) \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**  \nA: I weigh all my options and study each of them and choose the best one that seems the most logical/makes the most sense. Once my mind if made up, I don't change it because the option that I chose was the best one (in my eyes). \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\n**A: Emotions are very iffy for me. I tend to dislikes feelers (i love them but pls). I'm very aloof when emotions are involved and I tend to focus more on the logical side of the situation, why involve emotions' when we can sit down and talk this out with words and ideas? That is my thinking.** \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nA: I usually like breaking the norm, however I tend to stick to the rules if I'm comfortable with them. If I see a flaw in said rules I won't hesitate to question it. Should authority be questioned? Absolutely, I'm always willing to challenge authority with witty comebacks that might get my ass thrown in jail. I break the rules because I don't like being conformed, I need to keep myself open to experience new things/people etc.   \n\n\nHope this helps! Skipped a few questions because I was unsure how to answer them or I figured I answered them in another question. ", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": " ENTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Type me based on the info I gave you. Feel free to ask questions if you have any. Thanks for those who read it and shared your thoughts!\n\nI am a loner, I have no friends and I like masturbating to porn regullary, because it gives me the feeling of intimicy for short term + it feels good. I also love bodybuilding because the results I've gotten from it where amazing and every workout it feels like fighting a war where I can't let myself down. Though I started it because I was being bullied for my small size and stature. I also love music, especially Rammstein, I even got a guitar just to play their songs. I know all of their songs and listen to them regulary. I love that in their songs you can feel the strong, yet emotional voice and the heavy, yet ryhtmicly fun riff, synth and melody. I want to see them live, but they haven't tuered in my country yet. It's my dream to see them one time live. I also am addicted to my phone and the media, I stare down on these devices for my quick dopamine, hoping it will make me feel good, but it never does. I know it's bad, but since it's an addiction, I can't quit it so easily. Most people have it too because well the devices and the programs that we are addicted to are made to take as much attention from us as possible so we can stay addicted and give them all of our time which gives the companies enormous mense of power and money. I can't really blame myself that much that I have this addiction, but who cares? It's my problem and I need to fix it because no one else will. Though I tend to watch some fun things too on these devices that are not just straight up addiction like reaction videos to rammstein because I love seeing other people enjoy the things I enjoy too and it makes me feel that the band gets the love it desserves; Movies, any movies really, except less of the horror films, I like general films that anyone can learn from; anime, because there's just so much of it and it's all very enjoyable too, only problem is that a lot of it is very exaggerated and edgy because a lot of it is made by dellusional loners. I am a loner too, but not a dellusional one; Watching guitar tab videos where I get to learn how to play my favorite songs on my guitar, most of them are rammstein too; Just rammstein music videos or sometimes other bands too sometimes, it makes me forget about my struggles in life and enjoy the music by becoming a slave to it; Watching dating advice since I am lonely and want to get a somewhat attractive girlfriend who I get to have sex with time to time. I'e tried I've never gotten a girlfirend and have tried cold approaching and using dating apps, but no progress. To be honest, I want a girfriend mostly for the part to have sex, not to be emotionally connected since I realise how few girls and even guys are compatable with my personallity, there is a reason for why I have no true close friends. Though I still feel lonely and want them in my life, but I struggle because of my personality as I mentioned before, also because I have very high standarts - I want them to be quiet most of the time so they don't disturb me, I want them to abid to my rules, I like control. Right now I'm studying a field which is not really my thing but since it's the last year I might as well finish it and get a job in it for a year, if I hate it, I'll try to find another job in a completely different field like video editing because that's also a think I love doing. I sometimes produce small comedy short films with my friends who I don't contact anymore much. Now I have stopped because most of them don't like my control, but of course I want things in my control - I am the brains behind it after all, they don't have my vision. Well I'll see how it goes. Life is not that bad, if I can get a hot girlfriend to have sex with and a job in video editing if I will dispise my job after school (only one way to figure it out - by doing) then my life will be perfect, at least I think so. Well not really perfect since we humans allways find something we don't like about our lifes and we like to bitch about it, but it will be near ideal if I do manage to get that and I'll get other dreams after that too. I don't like following too much to the plan, because it generally not allways works out and then you feel sad. If you let the life guide you, sure you won't be as rich and powerful, but you will be happier and happiness is better than power and money in my opinion, after all money and power never meant much to me anyways.\n\nAnd yes, I've done the tests and read a bit of the theory, though not all of it so take this with a grind of salt. In my oppion all this theory is total bonkers and stupid. The more I read into it, the less sense it makes. It's so easy to make a theory which is so fucking vague that no one can really truly understand it. A fool admires complexity, the wise man admires simplicity. Things like - Do you see the big picture or the small details? My answer is - I see both and it depends on what is the situation. I don't think people can be so black and white, well at least not me. To a lot of these things mentioned in MBTI, I can't just sort myself and say \"I'm totally this and not that that\", no. It's not like I dispise all the pseudo science, in fact I believe in some of it like the fact that we use only 10% of our brainpower daily. But I rather believe a theory like that than MBTI because the first one is so simpler and everyone can understand it, there are no BUT's. What MBTI community is, it is just a giant circle jerk where people boast about dellusional things. I know I shouldn't give a fuck and you are correct. It's just that it's my oppinion and want others to hear it too. The only personality theory that I agree with is Big5 which actually has science based evidence to support it and Jordan Peterson has talked about it too.\n\nYou might be asking - then why am I asking to be typed for something I don't believe in? Well it's because a part of me wants to believe it, yet part of me totally doesn't. I don't know really, it feels like I have two different personas.", "clean_guess": "ISTP", "llm_guess": " ISTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am 18M. I encountered MBTI just recently and decided it might be a good thing to learn about personality classifications. I consider myself very introspective and like to think I'm relatively emotionally intelligent and I love to deconstruct logical arguments. I'd consider myself optimistic, though I have only managed to build that up after a great deal of work.\n\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impacts your mental/compartmental stability somehow?\n\nnot that I know of. sometimes, when I get too nervous, I can get WAY too much energy to mask my feelings. it doesn't happen often though, and I don't think I have ADHD or ADD or anything of the sort.\n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI grew up in a religious home, but pretty much lost what I'd consider a structured faith. after I went atheist for a while to determine what everything means to me, I stabilized into something I'd call more spiritual than atheist or religious, but I still follow along with the organized religion for other reasons that include consistent ways to meet people and a place where I can have a solid excuse to clear my thoughts and think about things\n\n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI'm still in school, I don't have a career yet and I have nearly no idea what I want to be because nothing I find fits with what I like except probably philosophy, though the top 10 careers for philosophy majors don't seem any more appealing than most other majors, for me\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI'm not entirely sure I've ever felt alone while actually being alone. I don't just feel refreshed, I deconstruct and reconstruct my entire philosophy every other weekend. I'm almost ready to take on the world after a few days of just me and my thoughts if my weekend goes well. I love being alone with my thoughts, but I also consider the emotional connections with my good friends and family just as important.\n\n* What is your relationship with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or an outdoor event? If an outdoor event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nsports can be fun if they're casual. I like walking and running to think things through properly. walking is especially nice when there's light rain or a grey sky to calm me down.\n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would consider myself a pretty curious person. I am usually good at digging through ideas to construct what I need if I have something to start with. I love puzzles, especially when all my hard work becomes visible and I'm on the last stretch. my home is a mess and I can't get it clean no matter what I do, but it makes it feel cozy when I need it. I usually put my mind on things like puzzles or a good philosophical idea to chew on, though playing games or doing projects with friends can also be pretty refreshing but I can't seem to maintain one while also doing the other.\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo, I wouldn't, unless I had to. it makes anything that goes wrong is my fault even when I actually try my best to keep things working smoothly. sometimes it's needed, but it's almost always a net loss for me emotionally. if I had much of a leadership style it'd probably have an emphasis on making sure everyone is on the same page so when anything goes wrong, we all know how to contribute anything that might help find a solution\n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity.\n\nnope, not really. I can vividly describe how my hands failed to do a thing when trying to play the piano or something, but I rarely improve at all and when I do, I sort of hit a max at an intermediate level long after anyone else would have gone and become experts\n\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art. If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI appreciate art that takes a calm emotion and conveys it properly. I like music that it's takes time to make a point and I also really appreciate when people can use weather or people in art to describe certain feelings. I am a casual enjoyer, but never an expert.\n\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nmy current philosophy on the matter is, that the past was a past you, that knew less. the present is where you can apply your full knowledge of a thing to good use. and the future is hopefully a time where you will know more and will use that knowledge to make even better decisions. the past happened, there's nothing you can do about it. the future is always going to happen too, and the best way to make sure the future you don't regret the present you, is to make the most informed decisions you can\n\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nusually, when people ask for my help, it's because they know I've thought about it for a long time. I'm happy to show people a more organized version of what happens in my head because it's almost the only time I ever feel like people can appreciate me for being good at something. (I'm usually the one asking for help when it's a project)\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nIt's so nice to be able to draw a direct line from what I'm doing to how it will help me achieve my core values. I can and have worked without that ability, but boy is it convenient.\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\neh, it's useful when you need it and it's always fun to watch a finalized system work in its perfected efficiency, but I think people value it too often above the goal itself and, in a way, hurt the reasons for the goal with that.\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI love to help people try to understand something and I'm usually upfront and step by step in the process in the explanations and how it could help them. I try to push people to improve, but I don't like it when I guilt-trip someone or lie to them or get them to not like something and I am always very aware of when that happens and I hate it, but it is kind of on reflex. I've made good progress recently about being direct, though. so that's good, at least\n\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nlearning and philosophizing. these things help me make the best decisions I can be fully happy with, even when it's wrong :)\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI like to learn by understanding the ins and outs and whys of the thing before applying it. I can handle it when I don't have that, but I don't like it. memorization is awful, it's better to just learn it. creativity is good, but can be really bad when I need to start being creative. logic is the best in my opinion. and I don't really know what 'physical senses' means in this case. I guess visualization presentations are nice when learning\n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI somehow do all of that at once. I plan a starting idea a lot beforehand and then step into it and work towards the idea figuring each new step out on the way\n\n* What's important to you and why?\n\nI've come to the conclusion that my core values are mental health, happiness, and compassion, so if I ever go against them, it means I misunderstood something and it always ends up worse in my opinion\n\n* What are your aspirations?\n\nmaybe one day, near the end of my life, I can be that old man, content with every imperfect decision. rather than that old man who tried to much, and regrets all of it\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI am kinda scared that, when I realized everything I have and someday, something might happen and i'll stop caring or trying to make the best decisions. realistically, I don't see that happening to me, but it's really scary when a good friend is THIS close to just stop caring about anything\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nwhen I laugh a genuine laugh with someone I know well has fun\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nWhen I fail to make the right step in something important because of internal reasons\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI used to have maladaptive daydreams, but managed to work myself into thinking more about what's important to me than just to escape.\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about it?\n\nIf it's forever, that might be nice for a bit until I inevitably encounter the possibility that I'll never get to talk to my favorite people or learn anything new about anything other than myself ever again, before regaining my mind and strangle it into doing things the best way for my values. then I'll die of thirst without realizing it lol\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nanywhere from a thinking night to a few years depending on how long-term it is. I don't change my mind much often, but when I do, it's a complete phase shift.\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI try to do it continuously, so it can be a couple of seconds or minutes on the low end and half a day on the higher end. I think emotions are extremely important to any 'self', but radical acceptance of them, and logical decisions based on values will always be the best step\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nyes, when I do, though, it is way too draining. I've been trying to prevent it from happening\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break the rules, why would you?\n\nI wouldn't consider myself a rule-breaker, but I think authority should always be challenged with new information and arguments. if I break the rules, it's always because I have a reason to\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\none where someone is striving for happiness and healthiness in mind body and soul to make the most of what they have.

{"submission": "I'll try explaining my beautiful, amazing girlfriend as best as I can: \n\n1. She enjoys deep talks and can easily switch between humour and philosophical/thought-provoking discussions. She is very abstract and hates real world talk for this reason.\n\nFor example, her ESFP friend was discussing with her friend group how a girl she was currently following on IG posted her ex. My gf was very disinterested, she didn't mind the discussion and just listened but i knew she didn't care. I asked her about it, she told me she didn't understand why she was following that girl if she didn't like her and if she was trying to get over her ex. It didn't make sense to her as to why someone would subject themselves to that. But she didn't say that to the ESFP in the face because she knew she'd be judged and lose the only friend group.\n\n2. I think she's on Ne-Si axis. Her imagination and memory is very vivid. She can remember multiple names from her childhood, very specific experiences. She can imagine a lottt. Whether it's cartoon styles, animations, filmography, it's almost as if...she is recontextualising art styles and incorporating them into real life and imagining them in scenarios. For example, she'll talk about how she can easily think of a way to make a film poster where the uni is either a tragic romance, rom-com, comedy, dystopian, war, thriller, fantasy and all. She knows how to change the perspective of many many concepts and be able to connect them all by referring to her memories. \n\nOne time we were discussing a psychological concept. She then had a hypothesis. She then referred to her past experiences to see if every single one of them validated it. If one didn't, the hypothesis was disproved. And then she'd try to connect all the experiences together and build a pattern off those. That's what i noticed, she does that a lotttttt.\n\n3. When making decisions, she is very slow. The reason for this is she needs to make the perfect solution. Because according to her, \"efficiency doesn't matter if the best outweighs the fastest shortcut and gives a better result\". Time is relative, lol.\n\n4. She can be insecure about people. People have always been her biggest weakness. She doesn't like how her whole existence has to be defined and adjusted according to people but she allows it to happen anyway because it is inevitable and a part of life. This is also the reason she gets very apathetic and go into a depressive mode, since she keeps thinking her wants don't matter and will not matter and she can only just live according to how her parents ask her, to how success is asked. She can get apathetic where she cuts off contact, prioritises studies and work and money, and fake socialising for the sake of the world.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hi all. I've had some pretty different results from different sites so I'm not very sure which type I am. I always tie between ENTJ and ENFJ but I've gotten INFJ as well.\nI'll give some of my personality traits so y'all can point me in a direction. Thanks in advance! \n\n**General traits**\n\n-I'm certain I'm extroverted, I'm naturally good with people and have many friends. I'm a very friendly person to strangers too\n\n-I'm pretty good at giving advice and generally enjoy helping others, every single friend I know told me I'm like a therapist to them\n\n-I'd say I'm pretty intelligent naturally, I'm good at analyzing things in-depth and making strategies\n\n-I always make plans for everything and always like to be prepared, even for the smallest things like organizing my day\n\n-I'm certain I'm an intuitive type, Ni is definitely somewhere high in my function stack, literally everything I think is in pattern recognition and I always have those \"Aha!\" moments that literally guide me to solutions\n\n-I'm generally a good problem solver and I genuinely enjoy thinking my way through something\n\n-I tend to constantly categorize everything, literally everything - people, things, concepts etc. and always separate them as \"good\" and \"bad\", consciously or not\n\n-I'm very emotionally driven and I subconsciously always try to find a connection with people, mostly romantic tho. For example, literally every time I talk to someone who even slightly resembles what I love in a person, I literally fall in love instantly\n\n-I'm very into self-improvement, I constantly try to change whatever I can about myself and I always strive to improve everything, be it my looks, my personality, my knowledge, anything. I'm basically never satisfied and constantly look for things to be better at\n\n-I have the \"chameleon effect\" where I can basically fit in with any group regardless of their values and characteristics. I've found myself subconsciously altering my personality in order to fit in with certain people, even adopting their way of speaking and their traits sometimes\n\n-I seem to care way too much about how people perceive me. I'm not a people pleaser as in letting people walk over me, but I always try to be liked by everyone, regardless if I'm interested in them or not\n\n\n**Dark/shadow traits**\n\n-I am definitely a very manipulative/machiavellian person. I don't always act on this stuff, only when necessary, but I generally seem to think in this way and when I'm not actively manipulating people to get something, I still do it subconsciously \n\n-I have some very narcissistic characteristics and relate to many traits of a narcissist. I can be pretty controlling, I'm very jealous and very obsessed with self-image\n\n-I have a very confusing paradox when it comes to empathy\n\nI really seem to lack general empathy - for example I rarely care when I hear something bad happened to someone I don't know or like, I really don't care about things like animals rights or and those sort of things, and I genuinely don't feel things at certain times, I've literally found myself forcing myself to be emotional about some things yet most of the times I've felt numb. \n\nYet when it comes to people I love, or people I'm interested in for whatever reason, I'd literally do anything and everything for them. I've found myself in numerous situations where I've sacrificed myself for my loved ones, or went way overboard with helping them. I seem to only feel things for a person when I actually develop an emotional connection with them, otherwise I rarely care\n\nIf it's worth something I'd attribute my lack of empathy to childhood trauma which I won't dwell too much into, but I don't think this is in my core personality, more like I've become this way after some events. I used to be very emotional and genuinely kind and good-intentional to everyone and everything\n\n-I am pretty sadistic and have some very violent thoughts. I rarely get into accidents and fights so I've never really acted on these thoughts, but I still find myself indulging in fantasies about just plain violence. But I'd say this too is a result of trauma and not really the way I am naturally\n\nNow with everything here, I'm really unsure what to type myself as. Two of the most common results I've gotten are ENTJ and ENFJ. Yet I don't feel like I completely fit in any of them. I'm way too emotional and \"weak-minded\" for an ENTJ and way too cold and uncaring for an ENFJ. I'd say I'm either a very emotionally healthy ENTJ or very unhealthy ENFJ lol", "clean_guess": "ENFJ", "llm_guess": " ENFJ", "logprobs": []}

Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI grew up in an East Asian culture and grew up in a non-religious/familial environment, but my relatives were religious. I went to mission school, but I was a rebel. In fact, even before that, he doubted and did not follow the presuppositions of society.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nstudent. it sucks.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nrefreshed.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI enjoy the sport I learned as a kid, but I don't give it meaning and think sports fans are stupid. I work out for me. But I'm a lazy and enjoyable person who does just a little physical training. When I play sports, I use a strategy and a way to move less and get caught off guard in order to win. In general, I enjoy indoor activities more, like reading and rapping. Other people say I have a knack for writing, but I don't do much because I'm lazy, and in fact, I spend most of my time on the internet, games, and YouTube.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm curious about my personality type and I find this one pathetic. I'm going to end this stupid question with a long and detailed answer. In general, I think about what I can be in the future. I have a compulsion to be unpleasant, and the desire to see if something feels bad is always a battle between reason and laziness. I believe that avoiding my feelings is directly related to defeat and anxiety.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI love to take on leadership. I'm awesome when I'm there. I accomplish by empowering the elite and giving orders to the idiots. I seldom engage in activities that I do not want to do and that I have no full authority over.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm honestly not very cooperative. But it would be better if most people cooperated with me. But I'm going to do it to the point where no one can criticize me (or at least hit back). I used to love doing things with my hands, but these days I'm afraid of getting my hands dirty.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI have a particular talent for literature and I have a knack for art and rap. I enjoy satirical picaresque novels and somewhat childlike novels, and I enjoy the dark rapping of witty lyrics with a variety of rhymes and flows. I also love the lonely vibe of Sting's Shape of My Heart, Eminem's Stan, and Bill Withers' Just the Two of Us.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI don't deal with them. Just kidding, I miss what I could have had in the past, not the past, I spend the present lazy and meaninglessly, and I have an pathological obsession with the future. I hope this answers my awesome lifestyle.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI help them for fun. If I notice, I will do it. If you notice it, you pretend to do it in moderation and then pass it off and justify it. Sometimes I want to brag to myself for being good, and sometimes I feel sorry for myself, but people don't feel sorry for me.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI will live with logical consistency and give a little sincerity to others if they try to distort it.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIt's very important when I'm not working. but I don't really live like that.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI let others think, I just need to know what they say, and I control my actions strongly. More often than not, I do it to gain something that is important to me, and in fact, it is more often than not to ensure my fun. I feel severe anxiety and boredom when I lose control of others.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nAs I said earlier. Because it's fun.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI am very, very fond of debate and logic, and I am also confident in memorization competitions. I am very grateful to the teachers of the speech impediment who tell me to see and follow along. I don't like having someone above me, so I actually like the way the real teachers give me resources and tell me to do whatever I want, rather than other teaching methods. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'm strategic, but more tactical than that. However, it does not hone the technique. I'm not afraid of the first situation I've seen, but I'm very afraid of a situation from which I have no way out. I'm good at breaking projects down into small pieces, but I'm not good at it because it's too cumbersome. I'm good at improvising. But in the midst of all this, I don't lose sight of my goal. If you're in the middle of writing an answer, take a moment to lift your fingers from the keyboard and applaud your abilities, knowing that it's a good way to see yourself following the wellness trends of the day.\n\n \u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?/ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI don't want to talk about the things that are dear to me.\n\nIf I had a personal aspiration, I'd like to fuck the real life version of Ahri.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nProbably fighting in some form. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nMaybe it's when I'm faced with the fact that I'm going to have to continue my pathetic and stupid routine.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream, I cling to reality. To pay attention to my surroundings, I need to be in mode. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nOnce I've made sure I can go out on my own, I won't really care.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nMatters over which I have full authority will be decided quickly. If I can't get it back, or if I'm stuck whining, it can be delayed tremendously. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nIt is accepted when it is small enough and divisible to be put within the framework of reason without changing.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI don't even want to remember it, except when it's to make fun of others.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nIf there is no difference between profit and loss, I violate it as long as it does not violate my values.\n\nusual typing test results: high Ti, Fi, Te, middle Se, Ne low Ni, Si, almost no Fe\n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "ISTP", "llm_guess": " ISTP", "logprobs": []}

I'm studying aerospace engineering in college at the moment. I can't really describe much else off-hand.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNo.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nMy mother was a strict Catholic while my father has always been atheist/agnostic. She tried very hard to push me through all the sacraments as my extended family did, but I couldn't stop questioning religion and the existence of a higher power. We drifted apart because of this. I guess I've always despised tradition in my family, so my father and I have always talked about religion and the existence of a god(s) together. She blames my father for making me a non-Catholic. ABSOLUTELY no shame to religious people. I am just answering the question about religious upbringing.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nCurrently a senior studying aerospace engineering. I hate the idea of a desk job, so I'm hoping I can be more of a hands-on designer or analyst in the field. If not, I'm aiming to pay off my loans in a couple of years, and then saving up to get my private pilot's license. I should have just probably become a pilot honestly, but I get bored easily. I kind of wonder if doing so may have taken the fun out of flying for me.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would love it. I relish the time spent alone in our house at the moment. I do enjoy seeing my friends sometimes though, but only in small amounts.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI love the outdoors. I enjoy hiking, camping, and just generally being outside. If I'm inside, I have to be moving after a bit (even if it's something mundane like pushups/squats/hula hooping while watching tv). Like I said, I get bored easily, so I like to dance, do martial arts, or generally do something more physical. I can't be bothered to go all the way out to the gym though, so I try to work out at home. Besides these things, I enjoy singing, occasionally painting, and playing musical instruments. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm never the idea-maker in group projects, but I've found I can be fairly creative when alone. However, all my ideas are on the realistic and practical sides. My ideas might concern interactions I have with people or tangible results to work projects. As I said, I used to debate about the validity of organized religion with my father when I was younger, but I think that's more because I was always rebellious towards my family's tradition. (not really about philosophical discussion of various dogma like life after death, god(s), and spirituality, but more so about how the church treats people and about crimes and negatives). I try to think of things that I will be able to execute. I don't really like brainstorming for the hell of it if it's a waste of my time.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI'll usually take the reigns if nobody else will. I think I'm good at steering the group in a general direction if that's what needs to be done. I have a decent idea of what results I need from a set of data or goals and do my best to yield these results. I'm pretty cut-throat unless I consider you a close friend, but I think I hold everyone to very high standards.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI do find myself coordinated. I've never liked organized sports since I was a kid (quit a baseball clinic once because apparently I was bitching about how the coach was telling me what to do...he was literally just coaching me), but I've always been fairly competitive, but nothing too extreme. I don't like starting conflicts in sports. But I find myself to be coordinated with dancing, yoga, and other balancing forms of exercise.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI'm artistic, but I try to \"think my art through.\" I can't appreciate art at an emotional level, but I try to analyze it somehow. I don't really care about broader meanings of art though. I enjoy art to enjoy art as a stimulus.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI try to forget the past (especially traumatic assault moments). I live in the present mostly and have a general idea of my future. However, I know that realistically I can't completely plan out my future, so I mostly take things in stride. Sometimes I worry about the future when it all catches up to me though. I was a very hyper-worrisome child (for reference, used to get sick about it, suffered from trichotillomania...those kinds of things). But I'm better now. Still protective of myself.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI usually help people I consider important to me. I can't be bothered to help most strangers out of desire. If they need my help, I'll do so to usually prevent conflict.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nAs I said, consistency is fine for a general outlook in my opinion, but I hate routine.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI consider myself to be a hard worker and can sometimes grow impatient with other people. So yes, efficiency and productivity are important. But as I mentioned, I don't follow a strict daily routine.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI try not to. Even when leading, I follow a sort of laissez-faire method of management. It's only when the group needs direction that I start controlling people. I still value people's opinions and feelings, but not at the surface level (I don't really express it much, but still make an effort to ask how people are feeling about a task I'm about to assign them).\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nDancing, walking in nature, singing, watching anime, listening to music, playing instruments. I enjoy the stimulus of art and exercise because it keeps me healthy, happy, and energetic. STEM can be a physically boring subject field to study, so I make an effort to move throughout the day. Lest I get depressed, honestly.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI need to physically see examples of concepts to understand them. That's why I learn better when for instance, professors physically write on the boards during lectures. I don't do very well at memorization unless it's short-term for an exam. I'd rather logically understand the subject so that I can reproduce results in the future than learn it quickly for the sake of getting a good grade. I also like when professors (or managers) cut to the chase and tell me what I should know. I don't like to \"go down the rabbit hole\" of further ideas and related concepts. I tend to lose focus when this happens.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI definitely prefer to improvise, but still with careful consideration. I'm fairly good at coming up with a general goal and assigning tasks, but even this takes some time. I strategize but don't always look seven steps ahead, only one or so.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI don't really think aspirations are entirely a good thing since they might just sign me up for disappointment if they are unattainable. I aspire to enjoy everything life has to offer and travel the world. I don't aspire to have a family or really even marry (maybe a life partner though). I get bored easily, so even minor aspirations of mine can change over time. I do aspire to be a good friend though.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nEver since I was young I secretly feared being alone or hurting others. I can sometimes be abrasive or cold in that I joke and poke fun. I kind of hate those things about myself. I hate when others are either annoying (talking too much or thinking of too many ideas aloud) or too selfish (thinking of themselves first rather than others' opinions and feelings).\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nThe highs are that I have finally found good friends in college and since high school. I always felt a bit like a fish out of water growing up (I was quiet, studious, etc.). But now I'm more socially active (still kind of quiet), but I have good conversations and enjoy going out sometimes to do things together.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nThe lows are that sometimes I feel directionless with my career. As I mentioned before, I hope I don't draw lines for the rest of my life. I'd like to do something more physically-oriented. I also have a secret fear that people don't like me. I guess I'm a people-pleaser in hiding.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream, but I daydream about daily life if that makes sense. I daydream about things I've watched, people I've spoken with, different workouts I can try, etc. I'm aware of my surroundings. Sometimes, I can get overwhelmed with too much sensory stimulation such as at a loud, bright, people-filled club. I'd rather engage in smaller settings.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nProbably a show I've watched lol. Or about things I need to do that day later on (chores, errands, personal health).\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI am an overthinker and I always have been. However, I think I have gotten better at making decisions fairly quickly based on what I'm given. Sometimes I think this might be because I fail to consider additional outcomes that might go wrong or things that should be considered if not given. I don't change my mind though. In my mind, if I've made a decision, that means I'm secure in it and I've thought it through.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI sometimes walk on eggshells with people's emotions and the ways I talk to them. I can be a little blunt, and I secretly fear this might hurt people. However, I rarely understand how I'm feeling until I burst out in anger or crying after bottling it up for so long (especially with love).\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNo. I never actively agree with people for the sake of it. I value honesty and being genuine. I'd rather outright agree with them, but not in a fashion to harm their opinions.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI do. I always ask why when someone gives me a task unless I 100% respect them (such as my best friends). I doubt myself sometimes, and they are people too, so why shouldn't I doubt them for the same reason? I guess I've just always been a bit rebellious.", "clean_guess": "ESTP", "llm_guess": " ESTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": " \n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.  \nTeenage girl, Not sure exactly what to say here, I can be lazy, but when I am interested in something I will neglect everything else to work on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?  \nno\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?  \nNo religious influence or anything. I think I didn't have enough structure really. Growing up in the early 2010s meant my mom had no idea how to regulate my use of the internet, since easy access to it was a new thing. All things considered, I could have gone in a much worse direction. Admittedly my \"upbringing\" isn't over, and I am definitely a very different person than I was a year ago, so maybe typing myself now is a moot point. But eh, whatever.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nHigh school isn't a job but it's close enough. I like going, I like doing stuff there, I mainly don't like the homework.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nHonestly it depends. If I'm invested in some solo activity at the moment (a new game came out, researching something, I just started reading a good book, etc) I'll probably be excited and refreshed. If I have nothing to do and end up just watching youtube, aimlessly biking around, reading, I'll be more lonely. (That's not to say I don't enjoy those things, moreso I need to be doing them actively to enjoy it. Passively scrolling through YouTube isn't very fun)\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nIndoor activities: I do a lot of studying/researching (outside of regular coursework of course), a lot of playing videogames, working on games/similar projects,   \nOutdoor activities: biking, just sitting outside (I'd much rather do school work outside than in, though it becomes difficult sometimes), running (I run track, though I'm not particularly good at it), In the offseason I go on long(ish) runs with my friends\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI have a ton of ideas, I simply don't have the time to explore them. I'm curious about a lot of things really. There's a lot of stuff like this (fun, but ultimately useless classifications), putting stuff into boxes is oddly satisfying (other examples would be the political compass stuff, other personality metrics, etc, etc). There's a lot of sciency stuff and about it's application (for real or ridiculous purposes). Out of the \"sciency\" stuff, it is probably physics or math I'm most curious about. Mostly because my physics teacher is just really really good at his job. Anyways, about the ideas. I have quite a lot, there are tons of stories I would want to write, but I can't because I lack the time. There are programs I want to write but I can't because I lack the time or the knowledge and I lack the time to gain the knowledge.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?  \nNo, not particularly. In group projects I'm often forced into it (most people are lazy and don't want to contribute). I don't think I'm good at it though. I can usually get people to do it, but not without coming across as an asshole. I get frustrated with people way too easily to become an effective leader.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?  \nPhysically coordinated? Absolutely not. In gym class when we play ball-based sports, I can't catch or hit the ball very effectively. This is probably why I run track... \n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.  \nNot particularly. I listen to music and read, I do appreciate good TV shows and movies, but most of them I can't in good conscience call them art.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past is, eh. I often dwell on minor mistakes much longer than necessary (I told someone that I didn't want to take AP chem and the ap chem teacher heard me, it still keeps me up at night a little bit... this happened a month ago).  The past was permanently stained by covid - I don't really like thinking about any of that. The present is definitely quite good for me. I might be a little overworked honestly, but most of the work is for subjects I enjoy, so it isn't too big of an issue. I used to be very worried about the future, and I still am, but as it gets closer, I get a stronger idea of what it is I want from it. From there, I can begin to work out what to do to obtain that future. Removing uncertainty from the equation makes it much less scary.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?  \nIf I am able to assist, I usually do so. I want to help because I enjoy helped - yes it's a selfish reason, but it's the truth.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?  \nI'm not entirely sure what this question is asking? Do I need consistency? Yes, if I didn't have any sort of routine life wouldn't be predictable enough for me to be able to focus on things I care about. Now I'm not exactly sure what is meant by \"logical\" here?\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery. I use spreadsheets for organization a lot. When doing homework, I write down how long I think each part will take, then I record how long it actually takes. I use this to adjust my predictions for next time and to track how much time I spend doing stuff. If other people work less efficiently, it bothers me. Lots of my friends are serial procrastinators which bothers me a lot.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don't think so? If people are doing something I don't think is right, I'll tell them, but I don't think that is controlling. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?  \nThis question is almost identical to the activities question, so just read that one again.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI don't know my learning style. I'd much rather have someone explain it to me while showing me how to do it, but I think that describes basically everyone. I prefer classes focussed on logic. Math is my favorite class, which is basically pure logic. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?  \nI have a \"work\" schedule. When I am working on something, I usually work for X amount of minutes each day, or do X percent of it each day (depending on the nature of the thing). Before starting something I generally try to get an overall plan, but not too detailed. My brain wants me to do every detail, but if I do that, the plan takes longer than the actual project. \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?  \nI don't know. I have begun thinking, but I'm not too far along. I want to go to college and likely study math. Now the ideal thing would be to get a doctorate and actually write math papers and actually be a mathematician. But I know my idea of that is probably an idealized version of it and is probably unrealistic. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI'm utterly afraid of failure. I hate it when people do better than me. I don't really know why. I suppose it could be because I attach too much of my self worth onto my ability to do stuff, so when people do those things better than me, it makes me feel like I'm failing at doing stuff.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\ncovid - there was a lot going on, but I missed everyone. I love my friends but I just couldn't see any of them. \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream all the time. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?  \nI write stories in my head.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI haven't made a single important decision in my life. I'm only a teenager.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?  \nProbably longer than it should. A lot of things happened during covid and I'm only beginning to come to terms with some of them. At the same time though, I usually don't let emotions affect me too much. Unless I am extremely upset, it won't stop me from completing tasks and school work and being with my friends and the like. Though basically any amount of any emotion gets amplified a hundred fold when I'm tired. This keeps me up at night often. Even when the things are minor during the day, I become significantly more aware of them when I'm tired.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNot really. If I disagree with someone, we usually end of agreeing to disagree. I don't want to back down on my ideas, but I don't really like arguing. If the person is unreasonable and refuses to do that, I'd probably just ignore them.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI break rules I personally disagree with. I don't break rules that I see the importance of. Authority should always be challenged.   \n", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "How old are you ? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n-I am a female, 18 years old and I've been interested in mbti since I was 15 yet I can't seem to figure out my type. I am definitely an introvert but that doesn't mean I don't like to hang out with my friends. However, hanging out with a group of people is so draining compared to hanging out with 1 or 2 people. I don't really like communicating as a group. I prefer one on one conversations. When I'm having a conversation with one person and it's a person I like, I tend to yap alot to the point where I say things that don't make any sense LOL but when I'm in a group I don't really say a lot. I'm quiet and I love to sleep.I also talk alot in my head than I do aloud. I am always imagining things in my head ig about the future? Idk if it's like day dreaming but I'm never in the real world. For instance, when I want to hang out with someone I imagine 95 different scenarios with them in my head and I haven't even asked them to hang out yet. Isn't that a bit silly? I'm also a huge procrastinator but I always get the work done just in my own timing. I procrastinate almost everything unless I absolutely HAVE to do it now.  I don't really like confrontation or conflict. I prefer to let the problem pass and go away on it's own unless it's necessary that it must be dealt with. I would describe myself as honest. I don't lie about who I am to others but I don't say much about myself if that makes sense. I'm also  really bad communicator. I talk so much in my head and then when I have to speak out loud I can never find the right words to say. Idk how much more I have to describe of myself or what else I should describe.\n\nIs there a medical diagnose that may impact your mental stability somehow? \n-I've been diagnosed with a General Anxiety Disorder.\n\nDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n-I grew up in a South Asian culture. The religion I grew up in is kind of confusing. My mom and I were Jehovah witnesses until I was 6 when she remarried into a Hindu family. I lived in that environment for 6 years until I moved to my dad's side of family (Christian) but two years ago my dad converted to Islam. Ngl, this made me atheist and confused about religion on the whole cause I don't know what to believe in. \n\nWhat do you have as  job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n-I'm a student. \n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel?  Would you feel lonely or refreshed? \n-I would feel refreshed. I spent most of my time alone anyway. Sometimes tho, I feel a little lonely but then when I'm actually with people I get irritated.\n\nWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n-I don't like sports and I'm not good at them. I don't really enjoy any outdoor activities. I'm really lazy I don't like to exercise either. I like to stay in my room and watch tvseries or sleep.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n-I'm more curious about myself than anything else which is why I want to know my mbti type. I don't think I can understand other people if I don't understand myself first. I don't really have a lot of ideas in group projects. I'm more of a \"give me a task and I'll do it\" type of person. I tend to think about myself in the future. I think of things that aren't even possible, at least for me. \n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n-I won't willingly take on  leadership position but I also won't mind doing it if no one else does. I don't really think I'd be good at it tho. I would consult with my team members and ask if they are okay with the direction we are going in or with the idea that I suggested. If majority disagreed I think I'd just go with what they want to avoid conflict LOL. \n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n-I don't think I'm coordinated. I am kind of clumsy. I would sometimes find myself tripping over my own feet. I also do not enjoy working with my hands. I am really bad at it. For exampe, I had to make 3D shapes out of paper. I had to redo it a countless number of times because it just wasn't turning out right. \n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n-I am NOT artistic this is a heavy no. I'm terribly bad at drawing, singing, dancing or any art in general. I'm not creative like that. There is particular forums of art I enjoy. I appreciate all types of art. I think it's really cool and I'm always amazed and fascinated by people who are artistic whether it be paintings, music, dance, sculptures, performing. I admire them.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n-Everytime I look back on the past it's always negative memories. I think of something embarrassing I did or just something bad that happened in general. Another thing I don't have much of a past meaning I have a bad memory. I don't remember alot of things that happened and usually the good things. Like my friends would be like \"Do you remember when we did this/ when you said this\" and I'm like \"Really?? I dont remember\" I feel like I'm always thinking about things that are out of reach. Maybe because I know it can't happen in real life so I create scenarios in my head and enjoy it. I think about the future alot. I plan conversations in my head and think if all the possible outcomes that can happen in the future if I were to make that decision. I won't really say im in the present. It's boring here. \n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n-I would help them although I don't think I'd be of much help. I would help them cause it's just a good thing to do. \n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n-I don't really like being consistent although I think it's fine. I don't know if I'm logical either\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n-It is important when working but I don't think I am productive and efficient cause I'm a huge procrastinator. \n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n-No I do not control others and I don't think I do indirectly. \n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n-My hobbies are sleeping and watching dramas. I play roblox, listen to music. My hobbies are pretty basic nothing extraordinary. I like them cause I feel most comfortable doing these.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n-My learning style is definitely visual and tactical. I learn from off hand experiences or visually. I find it auditory learning hard cause I have problems concentrating on what other people is saying due to the many thoughts in my head. I find it a bit difficult to follow instructions when they are told to me rather than given to me on a piece of paper. \n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n-I'm not really sure. I don't think my tasks ever get out of control where I have to break them up into more manageable tasks. I kind of just do everything at once and what I feel like doing in the moment. \n\nWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n-I aspire to live a better life than I do right now. I wish to be able to do things that will bring happiness and joy to me. Just being free in general cause as of now I feel constrained due to my strict parents. Professionally, my goals are basic I aspire to have a good job with a good salary, nothing much. \n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n-I fear spiders. They're just scary. I fear dealing with consequences. I fear conflict. I don't like arguing so I either walk away or just agree to what the other person says. I fear the unknown in almost everything. I think this comes with my anxiety. I fear not knowing the outcome when I make a decision especially if it's bad. \n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n-I don't really have any highs in my life. I'm not really a happy person nor a sad person. I'm neutral. I do find joy in watching dramas tho, as I said earlier and eating unhealthy foods. I also find joy in speaking to my best friend but shes inconsistent with her contact. \n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n-I tend to bottle up my emotions until suddenly it will finally hit me and  I will just feel so down and burst out crying (of course when I'm alone) This happens every once in a while I would say once every two months.  The low is in my life is due to my family. They are the root of my problems\n \nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n-I am NOT attached to reality. I daydream alot way too much. I am also not aware of my surroundings while I daydream. For instance when I'm with a group of people an theyre conversing with each other I would be daydreaming and have no idea what they're saying cause I'm so engrossed with my thoughts. It's easy for my to block out what's happening in the real world.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n-I would think of how to get out \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Why am I in a blank empty room?? I would probably also making up some crazy scenario in my head pretending I'm in a movie of some sort. \n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n-I take really long to make decisions. I'm a really indecisive person. I procrastinate making decisions. I tend to think of all the possible outcomes that can happen if I were to make a decision. I tend to find myself creating bad outcomes tho so I can prepare myself ig. I also consult others for their opinion when I have to make a decision though I don't really take their advice. I would if what they say is what I really wanted to do deep down in my gut. \n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? \n-Im not comfortable with my emotions. I dont think they're important either. They're a hindrance. \n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n-No I don't. If I don't agree, I don't agree. I don't lie to please people. Instead I would just tell them \"I don't know\" or \"I don't have a opinion\" Of course, I do this to avoid conflict. \n\n\u2022Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\nI do not break rules because I am scared of the consequences. 5 years ago I was a huge troublemaker. In school I got in trouble for the same thing more than 2 times and even got in trouble for another thing after that. I think those experiences really shaped me into the person I am today which is why I'm scared to break rules due to the consequences I will have to face after.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n28 years old. Male. Some people perceive me as quiet, but i'm mostly open with people i'm comfortable, loyal to my friends and have a disposition to help them when in need. I really like to be doing activities like working out or going out with friends, playing videogames with friends, listening to music for example or practicing a musical instrument. When going out i prefer to go to chill places not so loud.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nADHD, recently had the diagnostic for ASD and taking pills for depression.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nNever questioned about it, my family is mostly Catholic, but as a grew up i became less interested in the church than the faith itself. I think more of it as part of values. But as a child i have that subject told, to be a good person with values, be honest in what it do. I was a bit overprotected so to experiment or even go out was a bit different, i had the thoughts of \"is this good or bad?\". But followed mostly what i thought was correct, not because of religion or my parents, just because of my values.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nSoftware Engineer in Test. I like it, mostly because i'm learning new things and challenging myself, it's not so repetitive and i get to know more parts of the project not just the code itself or just coding all day. To get to know the ins and outs of the project is what mostly interest me, and i get to do that on testing. I'm working form home but also go to the office so i can also be with some friends in work, grab a coffee or just walk by myself to lunch somewhere.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would feel very relaxed and refreshed. I had experiences were i felt lonely but i became more comfortable to be by myself. I would go out and lunch somewhere, watch some videos, play an old videogame, go for a walk or exercise. I feel i have more control on my plans instead waiting for someone or planning with other friends and waiting what someone says and all that.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI enjoy both outdoor and indoor activities. I like sports, for example soccer or football, i was good on my childhood, i was on soccer teams and only once on a football team, i prefered more soccer because i played mostly. Right now i started to go to Crossfit and i like it a lot, also i like to play videogames with friends, not so much alone because i get bored easily lol but also being with my family, eating somewhere, going out to another city. I like going for walks and really liked hiking, watching the nature, camping as well. Also i enjoy doing crafts or for example carpentry, working with tools.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI think it comes as sparks (due to ADHD lol) sometimes i have great ideas on what to write, poetry is something i really like and how i like to reflect my feelings, also from time to time if there's any actual event or something i became interested within my hobbies i tend to investigate a lot, either on youtube videos, searching on reddit or wikipedia. I think when i have ideas i try to stay the most realistic as possible, on what i can achieve at the moment or what can help me with my current task or with what i have, of course i often leave that and start to have more out of the box or the ordinary ideas. But for example, on my job i try to look on each piece and then how can i put a new idea together. It can happen that i have paralysis by analysis in certain situations or when i have a lot in mind. My curiosities ten to be headed towards my hobbies, what can i learn more on my career, historical events, technology/computers how they work, weightlifting, psychology to learn more about myself, cars and how they work and how to work in them.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nDepends on the situation, i don't enjoy it too much. Sometimes it irritates me lol. In my childhood i feel i have more control of it but now i feel not so much. I think it would try to be as much as a help to everyone, in the case to guide them with something basic and then so they can go on with their work.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI feel like i'm coordinated, when playing bass for example or drums. When working out on Crossfit. When driving i feel i do it in automatic lol.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI enjoy art. Mostly writing like poetry or writing in general, also music, in the past i played guitar but now i'm learning bass. I don't have experience with paintings or drawing but i can appreciate the work from others and try to ask to learn more what they want to project on their work or what they do.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nFrom my experience i feel the past is something i need to learn from, appreciate and even the bad experiences. The present to do the most of it and be grateful for one more day and use it the best in my capacity. The future is something to look forward, do in the present for the goals in the future, to make plans on what to achieve.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI gladly help them, the way i do it is to understand first the problem they have, ask them what it's happening and then explain to them in general terms what they can do, so they can also use that to their issue. Show them examples, too. I don't have problems if someone request my help, maybe if i'm busy or with something i would tell them i can't but show them what they can use at the moment or of there's someone else that can help.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI'm working on it to be better on productivity and getting the right tools but it's important.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly?

What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI tend to learn better by being practical and audiovisual, i tend to struggle when is mostly someone just talking without any auxiliar tool or something else like a graphic or something visual or an example. I feel i can apply the theory in practice and see what are the behaviors or actions that it do, not just in paper. I feel that i need more time to understand it on the other way. I prefer classes involving creativity and logic.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nIt's something i need to work on, i feel i can break up the parts of the project or have in mind steps but often times if i feel stuck, i don't advance if i don't solve that thing first. I tend to get unmotivated and just leave it as is. I don't improvise so much, but if i have the knowledge in the task involved i can try to.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nHave a nice home in a chill area, be economically stable to be able to keep up with hobbies, travel and support myself and my partner.

Personally, being with my GF/partner, working out more and on myself (mental health). Have more experiences with my partner, friends and family.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nSpiders lol. I think rejection, losing someone i love. Not doing what i love or interest me or having that feeling of \"what if\" or \"i wished to do that\".

Irritable and frustated with my life and even if i mask it that everything is good i feel drained.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni day dream sometimes, about plans or something i want to do or have planning to do, or just remember something about a hobbie or want to try or need to search. Also I tend to pay attention on my surroundings, more about in the big picture how i feel, the weather, the sounds, colors, if something happens or where the sound comes for example.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room.

And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt takes me during the day, i think about the consecuences of the options, if there any benefit from where i am, try to research if it's necesary, i try to make the decision so it's all set. I have moments where i feel like i should thought more or do something else but i stay and reflect why i made my decision.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI think i take a while to process it and then i just start to think more logically on how i can percieve what it's happening on a more calm way or effective way. Emotions are important too, because that's how i can show my appreciation to my family, friends or gf.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nIn the past yes, to avoid conflicts. But now i'm starting to develop my own ideas and also express what i disagree. Still i need to work on that.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't break rules, i think there are for a reason. Some can not have any logic or disagree but in that case its where morals come into place. Autorithy when done wrong should be challenged.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "So I\u2019ve tried lots of online tests and always got intj, I could relate to intj and always thought I was until I began looking at the other personalities and realised I may be an istp. I know the basics of the cognitive functions but don\u2019t feel like learning about it all because I fell I could spend my time researching something more meaningful. So the question comes, can you guys type me or at least push me in the right direction?\n\nHow I ACT:\n\n-When in a social environment I struggle with small talk especially and if I\u2019m talking with someone I know I find it difficult to know what to say or how to keep a conversation going. I prefer to be alone or with someone I know but I do not have social anxiety.\n\n-When given a task I will assess the requirements and the steps to accomplish the task before executing each step. I usually zone in on the task and can get it done whereas other student just talk don\u2019t plan at all. I usually finish well before most student and get good grades for them but I tend to go over the world limit often. I prefer to follow my steps and check over it after many times.\n\n-I like plans and routines but 95% of my plans are embedded in my head. Although I love to follow plans and routines, and I have them for everything, I can survive without one and can adapt quite easily.\n\n\n\nHow I THINK:\n\n-When it comes to making decisions I usually prefer to follow logic and facts but I still consider my feelings, values and beliefs \n\n-When it comes to problem solving I first take note of what happened and what went wrong, then why, then how I can fix it, then make a plan and follow that until the problem is resolved. If multiple things go wrong I can prioritise but I have to break everything down much further.\n\n-When it comes to details vs concepts for info processing, I first look at the big overall picture then break it down and compare the facts, statistics and data. \n\n-When it comes to concrete vs abstract thinking for info processing, I am interested in abstract theories but I do like to focus on real world applications and facts.\n\n-I love to do things the most effective and efficient way and stick to it.\n\n-I hate doing things that are pointless and overthink everything but usually not in a bad way\n\n-I get very obsessed over things that most would consider weird like planes \n\n\n\nHow I FEEL:\n\n-when it comes to emotions, I don\u2019t readily show my emotions to others unless that\u2019s what the entire conversation is about and everyone is expressing theirs. Most of the time I just bottle it up or just hold back and start crying later as I am a male and that\u2019s the way things are. \n\n-When it comes to reactivity, I would consider myself calm even in arguments, relaxed and not too worried about anything. I\u2019ve never lashed out or got super mad either.\n\n-I can be unsure of my feeling sometimes as you can probably tell from the lack of content in this section \n\n-I feel like I may have some undiagnosed asd\n\n\nRandom stuff:\n\n-I will be sitting in class and the whole class will be silent and I will think of some random joke or meme I saw before and then have to try so hard not to laugh\n\n-When being driven around, I will daydream basically the whole time thinking about random stuff\n\n-I am always thinking about stuff 24/7 whether it\u2019s planning what I\u2019m going to do later, thinking about my day so far, thinking about something random, I\u2019m always thinking about something\n\n-If I don\u2019t want to be friends with someone but they talk to me nicely, I feel obligated to be nice to them\n\n-I hate phone calls, texting people, waiting for people to text back, small talk and generally don\u2019t know what to say in a conversation or just have nothing to say and I\u2019ll make stupid jokes\n\n-I have big dreams for the future in highly competitive industries but I always think that surely there will be people better than me and I won\u2019t get in\n\n-I feel bad asking for little things \n\n-I like peace and quiet and to be alone but also love the opposite, highly energetic and chaotic environments with loud noises \n\n-I also like stuff related to STEM, engineering, military, cars, aviation, guns and nature :)\n\n-I feel bad if I don\u2019t reply to every single response that people send on reddit \ud83d\udc80\n\nThat\u2019s basically all, if you want to know more specifics just ask. Again I always thought I was intj and everyone is saying that I\u2019m definitely not and I\u2019m most likely istp so here I am :)\n\nAlso I only understand the very basics of cognitive functions and I know that the online tests are not reliable.\n\nThanks for all the help in advance, hopefully I didn\u2019t get mistyped again and if you think I\u2019m something else please say so and why as well as the likelihood (high, low, most likely, ect)\n\nEdit: I am very creative but sometimes in a weird way, I tend to think very differently to others and I can be unsure of my feelings sometimes. Also sometimes when alone I will do something unbelievable beyond cringe and weird then just be absolutely disgusted and cringed by it. Also I can be extremely kind/generous, gentle and loving but that\u2019s a side that I don\u2019t like to show.", "clean_guess": "ISTP", "llm_guess": " ISTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "1. Describe your childhood and the top 3 moments that shaped you the most.  I grew up in a poor \u201cGhetto\u201d area and despised it, my mom often didn\u2019t have a lot of money and I had an intense hatred for anything that reminded me of my childhood like the ghetto subculture etc. I had to be homeschooled in middle school due to me having sensory issues and couldn\u2019t handle being in a building with so many people at once. My dad was abusive and I hated him, soon he got better but I still carried a load of hatred for him and my mother. My mother was very selfish and has made me feel very unloved most of my childhood. I plan to move elsewhere and start a new family. The only thing I can think of that really hit me hard was when my father screamed at me telling me how \u201cI didn\u2019t love my mother\u201d when I literally feared for her life for 60% of my childhood and hid a weapon in my room for if anything bad happened. (Dad was physically abusive)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 2. What is something you tell yourself that you know rationally is not true, but cannot help it anyway? (i.e. I'm guilty for everything, the world ends if I fail, etc.)  I have a fear that I\u2019ll end up loveless and homeless , without a family or even friends to support me. It\u2019s not my biggest fear but I have a fear that I might not make it in life or might just die before I\u2019m old.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. How do you cope with stress? Does this work?  I tell myself everything is gonna be okay, kinda like talking to myself how a normal mother would talk to her kiddo.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. What is the worst thing someone can tell you?  That there's no hope. I can get over anything as long as there's some ounce of hope but if there is none then what's the point of trying in the first place?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. What is your biggest fear? Do you know where it comes from? If so, where?  Probably dying and there being no god. I\u2019m not even super religious but the thought of just not existing anymore sickens me.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 6. Who is one character you wish to be like and why?  None of them?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Do you fear or crave intimacy? How does this affect your close relationships?  I crave romantic intimacy and I\u2019m pretty good at it, most of the time I gain confidence in romantic situations but if it's unwanted attention I'll freeze up and get a bit angry too.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. Do you give something in return? Why or why not?  Not really, I just enjoy giving other people gifts rather than receiving them. It gives me a sense of pride when I get someone a gift and they\u2019re face fills up with joy.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Name one time you felt embarrassed and why.  Rejection and shame, I don\u2019t know why but I gain an uncontrollable rage when getting rejected or shamed. For being rejected I just feel really ugly and it makes me mad however for the shame I get really angry at myself and others and get a bit embarrassed too.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. How do you cope with being angry? Does this work for you?  I look at the consequences first, although when \u2018m unhealthy I just let my anger out on random people. \n\n11. Do you like to lead or be lead? Why?  I\u2019m a good leader when I know my teammates but if not then I\u2019m usually the quiet shy one in the corner.  \n\n12. How important is independence to you?  Very important, I had to grow up pretty independent so I\u2019ll always have a good level of it.  \n\n13. Finally, explain what you do for each of the following  \n\nA) Anger: repress it, mask it, or intensify it \u2014Intensify it  \n\nB) Fear: repress it, mask it, or intensify it \u2014----intensify it \n\nC) Shame: repress it, mask it, or intensify it -repress it", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "This isn't a full type me post but it'll get me closer to finding my type.\n\nI said the following in a video three years ago: \"*I'm definitely Si aware and I'm pretty in tune with my physical sensations. I'm also quite adept at predicting what is going to trigger Si... what is going to make me feel (physically) uncomfortable or hurt or feel like crap, however even though I'm often aware of it and I can predict it, I can also ignore it. I've had a history of knowing that those things are going to happen to me and just saying to myself, \"whatever I do not give a heck.\" I'd often go into something and say to myself, \"I know this is going to make me feel really tired afterwards, I know I'm going to burn myself out, but I don't care, I need to have the experience... even if I know I'm going to be burnt out I still need to do this.\" I have a lot of burnout issues and that's been a constant theme in my life.*\"\n\nI was told that this is Si ignoring, and that was probably one of two times I got casually typed as ESFP (out of many many typings I have received!) but this one in particular stuck with me despite most people typing me as something on the Si/Ne axis. I say it \"stuck with me\" not in the sense that I'm certain that I'm an ESFP, but in the sense that it has remained within the realm of consideration for me even though I don't \"feel\" like an ESFP if that makes sense and am not usually typed that way.\n\nI think nowadays I don't recklessly burn myself out like I said I did then, I have gone full introvert\\* hermit mode (not a problem for me because I'm still very busy in other respects, such as college coursework) and I find that taking care of myself in that way has improved my overall quality of life significantly. Maybe I'm learning not to ignore Si?\n\n\\*Introvert in the colloquial sense, not the MBTI sense. I get typed as extroverted a lot in the MBTI sense, and I'm still trying to figure out what is going on there because I am quite possibly the most introverted person you will ever meet. I don't regularly talk to/hang out with anyone right now outside of my family, and that's fine because that's about the extent of my desire for social interaction right now and I prefer non-people oriented activities. I actually feel much better now than when I tried to be socially active, and deleting/deactivating most social media was one of the best things I did for myself. I know that isn't directly related to MBTI and that cognitive introversion/extroversion =/= social introversion/extroversion, but I have not come across anyone who is an MBTI extrovert and a complete hermit haha, especially ESFPs", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

If I don\u2019t have a plan I feel lost because I need a direction in life. \n- I have a strong opinion on topics but I am open for new perspectives\n- I have an inner intuition that tells me exactly what I like or dislike, if it\u2019s going to workout or if it doesn\u2019t. \n- When people give me a task I want to do it immediately so it\u2019s gone but I often still procrastinate and I feel bad about it \n- When I get asked what I feel about certain things I often can not give an answer because often times I feel \u201cneutral\u201d only if something happens in the moment I can pinpoint what exactly I am feeling but most off the time it\u2019s neutral\n- When people ask me stuff I tend to give them short answers I usually don\u2019t talk around the bush \n- People can not read my face because I can\u2019t really express emotions right lol\n- My voice is also always monotone.\n- When I\u2019m making decisions I always look what kind of outcome it will have and if it\u2019s a disadvantage and how it will effect me and the people around me and based on that I choose what makes more sense to me and has the least disadvantage.\n- I can control my emotions\n- I can complete tasks fast \n- I don\u2019t care how something works I just want to get it done but often because I get it done fast I make mistakes because I just focused on getting it done\n- I like to have plans and back up plans.\n- Most of the time I really don\u2019t care about stuff or put much energy on it\n- Crowds and loud noises irritates me\n- When I\u2019m stressed I tend to cry or have an outburst of anger and usually I talk to friends or to myself because I have to clear my mind and get everything out of me \n- I love to dress nice and to look good\n- I like to dance and to do many creative activities \n- I like to work on myself to be the best version of me in regards to my future partner or my kids. I just want to have a high quality lifestyle and mindset.\n- I\u2019m very sarcastic \n- I tend to notice when things changed in the environment \n- People always come to me if they need advice because I will always back everything up with facts and common sense \n- And I also need external proof of things I don\u2019t believe everything right away because I tend to be skeptical\n- if I know I can do something faster than someone else I will do it because it drives me nuts when someone is taking to long for things \n\n So that\u2019s quite a lot I hope it helps to figure my type out", "clean_guess": "ISTJ", "llm_guess": " ISTJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "Hi there, I don't usually post anything on Reddit, just kind of lurk around a bit, until I found this page. I've been having a lot of trouble finding my type. So this was like a lucky but perfect discovery for me. I find myself relating to a lot of the types, same for the functions. It's also difficult because it's like I have two sides? (I'll explain further in)  \n\n\nMy best friend helped me create an accurate description of myself, which is:  \n\nFriendly, charming, sometimes coming off as mean over text (without intending to), direct, but then a little closed up about personal thoughts and feelings, creative, playful and funny.  \n\n\nI'd like to add that I see myself as a sarcastic person. I like making a lot of sarcastic jokes which sometimes get me in trouble because my friends think I'm being serious. (My love language is teasing, I'll be very playful with someone, but I make sure they feel comfortable and I'll apologise should I have made them uncomfortable.) However, at my current workplace I'm not really comfortable and it's like I'm an entirely different person. I'm super shy and reluctant, when normally I'm pretty assertive and present. I'm aware of myself a lot, and how other people could be perceiving me. But at the same time won't give up my personal values and opinions. This shift in my personality doesn't help my search for my correct type at all lmao. \n\nRegarding interests, I play video games everyday and I'm always playing them with my friends. I'm obsessed with anything horror related. I watch a lot of horror movies, play horror games, watch scary videos. Anything, ranging from true crime to fiction. But I'm also really into fashion and make up. I like doing my nails, smelling nice (I have like a thousand perfumes and body mists) and presenting very feminine, which is a stark contrast to my interests haha. I also LOVE music, I don't create any myself but I'm listening to music anytime I can. Any genre, I don't care if it's pop or metal. As long as I like it, it'll be added to my Liked Songs.   \n\n\nI've also answered some of the questions that I found floating around here. I hope I've provided enough info now <3  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n\\- I'm a graphic design student. I think I prefer it as a hobby, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\- As long as I get to indulge in my hobbies then I'll be entertained for like, the first 24 hours, and then I think I'll start craving social interaction\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\n\\- I'm a gamer, so I'm inside a lot. But I also really enjoy going out with friends and going shopping, getting to eat and drink something. That type of stuff!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- It depends on what and with who, if it's something I know a lot about and with people I'm comfortable with I'd probably be a pretty decent leader.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\- I'm a graphic designs student, so naturally I have to have a little creativity in me haha, I like a lot of art forms, I think paintings are my favorite (?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\- I live in the present, don't think about to future but like to be reminiscent about the past sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\- I play video games all the time, and I like to watch movies and shows, I get swept away in them. But I also really like to hang out with my friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\- I'm not that good at planning, I like to vaguely get something going and then go along with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's important to you and why?\n\n\\- My friends and family, even though I do cherish my alone time I couldn't live without them. (Also music, I don't like sitting in silence)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\- I hate liars, I don't like people who are unable to read a room either, or act un accordingly in a certain situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\- I daydream quite a lot, especially if I'm low on energy and start keeping to myself. But I'm always aware of what's going on around me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\- There's probably a song stuck in my head and then I start to daydream or something, I don't really know because I'm always doing something stimulating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\- Very long, I'm indecisive AF. Even after I'll probably doubt if I made the correct choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\- I'm okay with them, I guess? Although I can get a little irritated quickly but I feel a lot, just have trouble showing that sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\- No, I think what I think and I'll say it. Especially if it's something I'm passionate about. But sometimes it's not worth the argument if I know the other person will blow up about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n\\- I don't tend to, but when I do it's probably because I have a disliking toward said authority figure, lol.  \n\n\nI'm open to answering any questions/elaborating on something, should anyone want to :)\n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI'm 20, and I'll be 21 in 4 days (writing this on 12/21, birthday is on Christmas).\n\nPersonality wise, I'd say that I'm a person who's gifted, but wasn't in an environment where those gifts could be utilized to their fullest... At least not yet.\n\nI have a pretty short fuse, and get frustrated by small things. It's worth noting that I don't worry about large problems, and have no problem coming up with ways to deal with them, small problems just push me to my limit.\n\nI know I'm pretty arrogant too. I have almost complete confidence that I can handle whatever life throws at me, and if I can't, I'll learn from it so the next time I can.\n\nI detest failing, and have a tendency to avoid it at all costs. I suffer from \"Gifted Kid Syndrome\" pretty badly, leading me to put off things that I know I won't be able to do first try, though I'm slowly shedding this mindset.\n\nI'm into gaming, writing, and drawing. (I'm sorry of this isn't a lot of information, but I actually had a hard time thinking of things I'm genuinely interested in.)\n \n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNo medical diagnosis, but I probably have ADHD and Social Anxiety. Possibly ASPD.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nMy upbringing was in an entirely female, single parent home, that didn't have much structure, but a basic ruleset that had to be abided by.\n\nI am the oldest of three.\n\nWe were religious, my mother placing extreme faith in the God of Christianity; I abided by the rules set by the Bible because my mother (whom I idolized), did. I agreed with some of them, but didn't understand the reason for others. This used to drive me insane as a child, seeing as there was little logical explanation in her views (and thus the principles we were being raised upon).\n\nAround 15 years old, I grew tired and abandoned Christianity entirely before returning at 17 years old due to interest in following a higher being for a placebo sense of security/stability.\n\nI didn't have much privacy growing up (as I slept downstairs on the couch), a factor that I came to resent and fought my mother over the years for, until I eventually got my own room when one of my siblings went to live with a close relative.\n\nAs a kid, I fought a lot. At first it was to defend myself, but after a certain point (2nd grade) I found myself pushing buttons/taking things too far because I liked the feeling of being angry and being in an altercation. I usually won, but even if I didn't, I still had fun being mad and releasing it. \n\n(I believe this was due to the fact that I didn't want to disrespect my mother, because again, I idolized her.)\n\nThis came to a quick halt in 7th grade when a law was passed in my state that meant a physical altercation could land me in a juvenile delinquency center.\n\nSince then, I've been mellowed and far less aggressive, even complacent in some ways.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don't have one at the moment (just left a call center job due to a genuine lack of interest and hate of meaningless work), though I am going to the military early next year.\n\nI tend to keep a job, and if I don't have one, I'm learning skills to apply to a future one. I hate sitting around feeling useless, or that I'm not working towards anything.\n\nFor example, I left my call center job around 8 days ago. In that time, I've began to learn Python and am planning to brush up on my skills in Blender when I'm done.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nAlone? Like completely alone? I think I'd implode. I like alone time, but being 100% alone (in silence no less) leaves me too much time to ponder the choices I've made and if I'm really happy I made them, or where they put me in life.\n\nSo probably lonely LMAO\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like excersizing, gaming and writing. I'm not good at sports, but I don't mind playing them if others are. I played them frequently until around 6th grade, and then lost interest.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm curious to a certain extent, but my curiosity about something varies more on if it'll lead me to, or help me achieve/get something I feel is worth the effort.\n\nI can come up with a lot of ideas, but a lot of them get ruled out before they enter the point of consideration. Most things that make it there get tested to see if they're viable (or can contribute to something that is).\n\nMy immediate ideas are more environmental and focused on what I can use around me to solve a smaller issue. My bigger ideas are conceptual, but just enough to where it's a big plan that can be achieved within means, while still leaving me time to achieve personal goals (self-discovery, becoming a better person)\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo, probably not. I don't like dealing with people and prefer to collaborate rather than lead. It's not to say I'm opposed to it, but I'd have to clearly exceed everyone else in the room in the highlighted fashion to justify doing so.\n\nI'd be great at the leading, but not being a leader. I have a tendency to be condescending and aggressive, which doesn't lead to anything good in a group.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm somewhat coordinated, but not to what I feel is a satisfactory amount. I frequently lose items and forget events, leading to a near constant feeling of imbalance, mentally and physically. I like working with my hands in technical work (HVAC, Electrical), and excersizing in any form.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI'm artistic, but not too original. Most of my drawn pieces are based off of whatever style I see that I like (Usually Comic/Manga artstyles). My art is a representation of what I saw and and what I would do with it under the same guidelines. \n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past has nothing to do with me, and I'm almost completely uninterested in what goes on back there. The present is a nice place to be, and somewhere I've recently learned to enjoy a little more. The future is where I look to achieve and become the best version of myself, and is where I'm usually focused on.\n\nAs for how I deal with them, I don't care about the past, and the present is a temporary place that I'm in to achieve my goals for the future.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf I'm able to, I will try to help since I know what it's like not to have a support system; but I won't get strung out for too long if I'm unable to. As for the second question, I try and act like it's not an inconvenience as to not hurt the other person's feelings.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nA few months ago, I was obsessed and would've said yes, but now? \n\nI realize that it isn't important (or worth the effort) to have logical consistency, and as long as I achieve what I set out to do, I don't have to understand everything... Just whatever makes sense to look into.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nEfficiency is a priority (I hate working more than I have to), Productivity is only important if it's towards a certain goal;\n\nI want to get the most done in the least amount of time, and I want the fruits of that labor to go towards whatever it is I'm trying to make happen.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nYes. I don't trust anyone and have a tendency to keep people on short \"leashes\" as to prevent any action they take from causing me problems.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI like gaming, writing, and drawing. I think I like them because it fills a \"void\" that I feel is time spent not making money or doing something important/meaningful.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI'm a logical learner who learns best hands on. I struggle the most with academic environments, as I have a hard time working in \"concept\" only. I can learn with visual/auditory (considering I can see/hear), but hands-on and muscle memory is by far the best way for me.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'm pretty good at strategizing, and can usually chop up most projects into smaller problems I can solve. How I solve those problems is usually improvised (quick & dirty), but I have a general roadmap/idea of what I need to get done to get things solved. \n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI aspire to reach a point of high financial stability, alongside marrying a woman who can give me children so I can provide them the life, and the opportunities I never had growing up due to financial reasons.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI don't have many \"fears\" about life in general, only two;\n\nThe first being the event that I won't be able to achieve my goals for whatever reason, meaning I won't be able to give my wife and future child the life they deserve.\n\nThe other is to do all of the work to set up a life for them, only to never get married or have children, and for my work to be nothing but meaningless effort that only benefits me.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nGenuine happiness, self-acceptance and true contention with life as it is. Oh, and I'm usually in a relationship (Recently found out it makes me happy beyond reasonable measure to go all out for one person and make them happy).\n\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nSelf-critical, lazy periods in which I sit around and wonder what to do, and simultaneously what I'm doing wrong to feel the way I do. A lot of self-pity.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI'm somewhat attached to reality. I daydream pretty often about what specific things I want/goals I have, but I maintain a sense of my surroundings (though it's worth noting I don't have a good sense of them even if I'm not daydreaming).\n\n\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI'd be bored beyond belief. Then I would probably start thinking too hard about x event where I made a bad judgement, and I'd break down mentally before I lock back in and push it back down.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI think about it for a day or two, and then force myself to make a decision (or not to make one), as I hate the \"cloud\" that looms over me during times like that.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI don't take too long to process emotions. I understand what I feel and why, but generally don't think too hard about them, unless I'm at a \"low\" point, in which they're all I fixate on.\n\nI used to consider them unimportant hindrances, but I now see their value and why they're important.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes, I do it often as to not cause problems within my relationships. I love the people I keep around, and would like them to stay around... so if I've gotta keep my mouth shut to keep my need for human connection satiated, I don't mind doing so.\n\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI break rules if doing so is either personal, or beneficial towards a goal. Authority should always be challenged, seeing as challenge is justifying the reason for it's existence. I break rules as I see fit, and maintain an awareness of the fallout of such a choice. It's not to say I'm lawless, as I do have a set of rules that I absolutely will not break; just that most rules don't fall into that category and are subject to breakage.\n\n\nI dont know if this will help, but I am a Counterphobic, SX 6w7 with a strong 8 Fix, and a 638 Tritype in Enneagram. I believed I was INTP, but after reading up on cognitive functions, I may have been wrong. I just need help typing. Thank you to anyone willing to help in advance.

If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n- I\u2019ll give them suggestions and eventually do it myself (the latter is only when they\u2019re idiots and can\u2019t follow instructions).\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n- Yes. I\u2019m a realist to the core. Logic is required to understand the world and get results.\n\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n- I highly value efficiency. Efficiently leads to productivity leads to my happiness (getting sh*t done).\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n- I try not to. I can be blunt and tell them to stop doing something I find annoying. But I usually keep myself out of other people\u2019s noses.\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n- Gaming, reading, playing+listening to music.\n- I just like them.\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n. Logic+hands-on based. More immersive and enjoyable for me.\n- If it\u2019s memorising then I\u2019d be bored.\n. I  like classes involving logic and my physical senses more.\n\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n- I\u2019m good at strategising.\n- Yeah, I do.\n- But I usually improvise as I go. I don\u2019t have a plan, but I find ways to be efficient and complete my work ASAP.\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n- Just don\u2019t be last place at anything.\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n- I don\u2019t really know, I\u2019m scared of cockroaches I guess\n- I like people I can vibe with, or else I\u2019d rather be alone. I hate idiots, annoying/stupid/irrational/emotional/dramatic people, etc. (i hate those the most)\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n- Nice, enjoyable. Efficient, independent. Fulfilling. Or just me doing things I love.\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n- I don\u2019t know??\n- Irrational, full of drama.

If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n- I\u2019m down to earth.\n- Daydream when bored. I observe otherwise.\n\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to.

And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n- An instance - a few seconds, or a few minutes - indefinite time (therefore needing someone else\u2019s input) It depends on the choices.\n- I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m stubborn.\n\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n- Quickly. According to my friends, I have 4 moods: Annoyed, pleased, bored and neutral. Occasionally happy/feeling joy.\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n- Yeah, to stay out of fights and arguments. \n- Once in a while. Cause my friends have dumb ideas sometimes and I don\u2019t want to accidentally piss them off with a snide comment. But I\u2019m straightforward and blunt with really close friends (since they understand I don\u2019t mean to sound mean)\n- Also applies to strangers (I just say no unless I think otherwise)\n\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better?

{"submission": "I've been in typology since I was 14 or so, but obviously, your personality isn't quite settled in until you're in your 20s or so. Now as I'm breaking free little by little from the state of psychological dependence on my mother (ISTJ), which unfortunately delayed my individuation, I think my actual type may be starting to shine through.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm an introverted type but I may be an extroverted one that has been somewhat \"repressed\" into introversion by my upbringing. I generally get typed as INFJ by tests, but again, that isn't quite the reliable thing either. \n\n**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n24 and female. Trying my best to break the cycle of trauma/abuse in the family, build a life that is mine and only mine, and express my full potential, or at least try my best to do so. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\nLikely CPTSD, though I don't have an official dx. Definitely a whole lot of emotional trauma I'm not yet done unpacking. Misdiagnosed as bipolar a few years ago.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\nI unfortunately am not employed right now, but this summer I had a really nice job at a port where I'd welcome people and their boats. I wouldn't do much except register reservations, give some addresses to go to, register payments, but the experience was wonderful. It was mostly about the environment I was in (green spaces, ability to go outside while carrying the work cellphone in case someone arrives, seeing all these different boats, and the water itself being quite calming), the hours, the slow-ish pace, as I don't really tolerate faster paces. The work also was fairly simple. Now I'm looking for a similarly simple job as to have enough mental energy to spare into my own projects.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nMy favourite things are writing, drawing, listening to music (unfortunately never had any musical training in childhood and am afraid of making noise... but I'd secretly love to sing and play stringed instruments, there's just something about the strings that I really love), reading, and I guess I could consider my interest in fashion and makeup as a hobby too. I've dabbled in a bunch of things but all have creativity in common.\n\nI could be good at sports if I put my mind to it, I think, but I'm mostly not a fan of it. That being said I'd love to practice energy-oriented martial arts such as tai chi, qi gong, or another one I really love: iaido. I used to ride horses in my younger years.\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\nOh yes, I am curious. I love a good mystery and I like to know a lot of things. My curiosities are mostly cultural, musical, historical for some, or environmental. Got a thing for medicine as well.\n\nI do have more ideas than I can execute or have energy for indeed, but the main ones always win. I prefer to stay focused only on one idea/project as to not scatter myself and get lost.\n\nMy ideas are more often than not triggered by realizations about things that happen/have happened to me or others, and generally always have an anchor point in the real world. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\nHmm, not really. Too much responsibility. Too much potential for things to go wrong and for me to come under fire. I'll pass.\n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\nFairly. Coordinated enough not to cut myself with a knife while cooking, or accidentally poke my eye with the mascara brush while doing my makeup. But I guess I could improve it even more if I wanted to, and if I wasn't scared of screwing things up. It's not so easy erasing a mistake when you've cut a piece of fabric the wrong way! \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nAs a teenager, it was mostly expressive and involved furry characters because I wanted to represent the people around me without them knowing. As an adult, it has turned to something more symbolic and I've started to involve humans, but I still have a psychological barrier with them. I unfortunately have lost my ability to make proper visual art after a really bad relationship event something like 9 months ago, but I'll get back there eventually, perhaps with an entirely new style that marks a \"new era\" of my personal journey.\n\nMy writings are in settings that could classify as magical realism or fantastical, but never in a 100% fantasy world. I wish I could have a more cartoony or simplistic art style but I feel weirdly compelled to make it at least somewhat realistic. What I like about writing is that it's less obvious than visually drawing something, and thus I can hide many more things and express a lot more without causing potential trouble for myself. But yeah, mostly magical realism, romanticized things inspired by real-life events or internal processes. A more spiritual take on reality.\n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\nThe past can be a guide for the present, especially about people's behaviours and patterns (general or personal), but the older I get, the less I'm comfortable about letting it affect my present and future too much. The present is the only thing we can be sure about, and while I used to make very rigid plans on the future, now I think... perhaps it's not worth it, as it has consistently backfired. It's good to have a vague idea, but ultimately the future is up to things we possibly have no idea about yet.\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\nPretty important. I get impatient with things that are riddled with unnecessary U-turns, twists, and whatever else to get from point A to B, or when I have to justify something that is glaringly obvious. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\nUnfortunately, yes. I'm trying to break out of it though. It's mostly out of insecurity and fearing betrayal by others, or fearing that I won't get what I want or will lose in a situation. I can be emotionally manipulative and lie by omission to ensure someone is not going to get in the way. I can be quite envious and jealous of others and plant ideas in their mind to keep them close, which is a very unhealthy tactic I legit cringe at when I noticed I've done it. I get why I do it though. Trauma response 100%. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI learn hands-on, or \"by fire\" the best. When I learn a language, for example, I don't bother endlessly following textbooks or whatever: the most I do is ask questions or look for how a certain grammatical structure is used, and I look up my words/conjugations as I need them. I also watch local TV and listen to music in the language. \n\nI'm also a good visual and kinesthetic learner. If I write something down or do something (doodling for example) while learning, it sticks better.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\nI'm optimistic, emotionally stable, neither too excited nor too under-stimulated. I'm sociable, yet still not fully extroverted. I can balance both my need for social interaction and alone time. I have energy to walk, to do things, and I can accomplish a lot and be quite active both mentally and physically.\n\nI'm accepting of the fact that I can't control much in life, try my best to improve myself, try to find ways to relax and enjoy the moment if I'm starting to become anxious, in other words emotionally stable and somewhat mature.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\nTwo different possibilities: either I'm a complete shut-in, dissociated, depressed, no energy and feeling like everything is so heavy on me. Like even carrying myself is too heavy. I feel contemptuous of everyone, fall back into my patterns of criticizing and nitpicking, and even have a sadistic streak towards those who push my buttons. Just an urge to do the worst possible shit to them.\n\nThe other side: I become unusually extroverted, am desperate for love and connection, become incredibly impulsive with money and doing risky stuff, become somewhat hysterical with my emotional expression, seek escape and generally end up burning myself out trying to plow forward and fix whatever I find to be a problem. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\nAs I've mentioned earlier, reality is a non-negligible part of my creation process. In general I say I've got one foot in reality as not to go entirely nuts, and the other in the... well, other world, whether it's real or not. My daydreams are tools for either satisfying myself or creating something, but they're quite vivid, and it used to be a problem in the past. I wasn't exactly losing awareness of my surroundings, as it feels like I can easily \"zap\" between the two, but I was living more through my dreams than through my actions because of a fear of rocking the boat by changing or otherwise acting differently than an overgrown kid hiding in her room. Fear of upsetting my mother or overall do something unusual that would grant questions. \n\nCan't blame myself however. It was a dissociative mechanism that wasn't my normal functioning. Now as a somewhat healthier person, they're more of a tool. \n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\"K, let's wait for the moment I'm taken out of here.\"\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\nI need to process it first, but once I've made it, I'm not changing my mind unless there is truly a legitimate reason to do so. And even when I regret them, I still think \"well, that was the choice I've made, can't go back\".\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\nIt takes me a fairly long time, but I think it's more of an upbringing thing than a MBTI thing. Emotions are very important in my life, but they've routinely been squashed by my parents growing up, so I unfortunately learned to repress them and still am battling with unlearning this. By nature, I'm quite expressive and emotional, but since no one else in my usual environment (mother, brother) were, I internalized that I had to be like them, cold, unemotional, and my rare true expressions, of enthusiasm particularly, were either ignored or dismissed. \n\nNow that I'm gravitating towards more emotionally expressive cultures and people who will be more accepting of my emotions, I'm letting them come back to the forefront, at my own pace. In the past I could often be very dramatic in expressing them because that's all I knew, either repression or exaggerated reactions. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\nYes, but again, I think that's a trauma response, and I try to break out of it. It's rather often, but I'm now making a point of expressing my disagreement even when I feel like it's potentially going to make the other person turn on me, because nothing is worth the resentment of burying one's truth just to keep the peace.\n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\nThe rules I follow are the ones that if broken will have an impact on others. I had no problem skipping school but I wouldn't skip work because if my part isn't done, someone else may get an extra load, and the cogs in the machine cannot turn. \n\nAuthority sometimes knows better, but sometimes is just purely arbitrary. I have respect for the first, especially if they've proven themselves to be respectable, but for the others, while I wouldn't purposely break rules to be disruptive, I care less. I just let them live. Someone making a fool of themselves isn't my problem.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "Hi guys!! It would be such a help if someone were to help me find my type. I\u2019ve studied cognitive functions thoroughly and can type others, but with myself, it completely evades me. I\u2019m a 20 year old woman if that helps.\n\nI\u2019ve narrowed it down a little. I\u2019m probably not a high Se user because I\u2019m always in my head and suck at physical activities. Probably not high Si either because I don't take the past much into consideration and can (buffoon) traditions.\n\nI struggle to see if I use ni or te when trying to get things done fast without regard for details.

I\u2019ve been called passionate and even too idealistic and I dream too much about what could be\n* Ne: I think my ne is pretty good and when I see things I\u2019ve done in the past, my ne is very clear (made videos about random and funny things, same with a comic i did recently)\n* Si: I very much enjoy routine and predictability in my life. My mom loves quoting me when I said \u201cI\u2019d rather be safe and happy\u201d when faced with something risky (I think it was a ride of some sort?)\n* Te: When stressed, I tend to try and solve everything quickly without much elegance. I can be uncharacteristically cold and elusive and I often feel like a failure during these times\n\nInfj:\n\n* Ni: I often envision a future for myself and what I\u2019d need to do and exactly what may go wrong to get there. I\u2019m often absentminded and focused on one thing and I always get told I overthink too much. I take apart people's words (their language, facial expressions, tone) and see if it matches up with their usual character. If not, I immediately try to see what may be troubling them. Meaning has always been a major part of my life and when I\u2019ve been depressed, it was because of lack of meaning.\n* Fe: I am open with others if it makes them feel more comfortable and I\u2019m overall trusting of people. I know the social expectations and try to conform with them to get along with others. If I see everyone around me is doing well, I\u2019m doing well. I\u2019m often too concerned with what other people may be thinking\n* Ti: I can be very critical at times and I\u2019ve been called both that and harsh by others. People close to me avoid logical arguments with me because I get far too into them (lol) and my mom has called me an \u2018angry sparrow\u2019. She also enjoys quoting me to her clients when I said \u201cit\u2019s not an opinion if I\u2019m right\u201d lmao\n* Se: I overindulge on bad things soooo much. Oh my god. I\u2019m very clumsy and impatient at times and it leads me to missing so many small things and it backfires on me all the time. In school, I\u2019d get good grades but I\u2019d miss things all the time because I didn\u2019t pay attention to details.\n\nThanks so much if you\u2019d take the time to evaluate my answers, I\u2019ve been stuck forever on this!!", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}

But yes, most of the time I am aware of my surroundings while daydreaming. \n\n\u2022Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? \n\nI daydream lol. I used to see myself in possibilities or dreams about how I would be in other universes. \n\n\u2022How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? \n\nI make important decisions in an instant. And then I change my mind often. \n\n\u2022How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? \n\nIt takes me a long time to process emotions, too long. Most of the time I repress them. I don\u2019t care them. \n\n\u2022Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? \n\nNo, never. But I don't create tension. I ask more questions about the other person's ideas. \n\n\u2022Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why? \n\nI don't break rules unless I think it's unnecessary. There must be authority. But it's important which laws and how they rule.\n\nI will answer any other questions.", "clean_guess": "INTP", "llm_guess": " INTP", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "\nTo me the outside world is a bit more unpredictable and scary. Things are constantly happening and there\u2019s a lot to do and a lot to account for. I usually try my best to adapt to the chaos in the world and I think I navigate it by being friendly and open to new things and ideas but this is unlike my inner self where I\u2019m taking this information in and either storing the information to think about at a later time or allowing myself to be skeptical and uncertain and true to my thoughts and feelings. I find my inner world to be comfortable to me in a way that I feel like I am able to judge, feel, reason, anything in the way that I want without anyone telling me anything about it, i provide myself comfort and patience (although sometimes I am highly critical of myself). I know that I have that inner world so whatever I do in the outer world, however inconsistent I am, I know I am able to reason and figure out why I do the things I do and I can make sense of the world around me later.\n\nWhen it comes to the concrete vs concepts, im a lot more interested in concepts but that\u2019s only in my own head. I like thinking about the idea of something or what could be but im also highly aware of what\u2019s actually possible and fits the circumstances and the situation. I notice that in everyday life I\u2019m not likely to starts a theoretical or conceptual topic of conversation myself and I often just prefer to listen to what others say and expand or react to that. I might let my mind wander though. Sometimes when I make decisions an image of a future outcome pops up in my head and I use that image and my curiosity of what that action entails to decide on it. Sometimes too many nice images pop in my head and it\u2019s hard to decipher which one I really want.\n\nWhen it comes to logic or values I tend to be a bit focused on what others feel and what I feel first. Yes sometimes this happens at the same time. If it\u2019s a trivial issue or an everyday decision, I tend to just go with everyone else to preserve the harmony. I don\u2019t like disharmony, it ruins the mood and it ruins plans and stops things from continuing in motion I find. I feel responsible for the emotions of others and might get annoyed when others don\u2019t return the favor or don\u2019t value my feelings or those of others. When people don\u2019t consider the humanity and feelings in others it can make me upset. I can easily find reason why people do the things they do without them needing to explain it to me and sometimes that\u2019s enough for me. I am constantly trying to refine who I am and what I value so that I can choose a path I won\u2019t regret. Regretting the path I choose is something that keeps me awake at night and it makes me scared of my future choices and if the things I want, I truly want. \n\n\nI used to think I was comfortable going with the flow of things but I think the reason I am able to try and adapt is because I\u2019m so scared of not being able to adapt that I tend to try to turn off that part of my brain so I can just do things without over-analyzing because when I overanalyze I can get stuck in negative head spaces or it can stop me from completing or getting through tasks or activities. I think I try to be adaptable but I have to consciously put the mental effort to be more proactive instead of just reactive.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I am not the kind of person who took  the test, saw memes, and got confused. I study psychology out of  passion, as a hobby. and I have been interested in this topic for 1  year, delving into it extensively with a friend of mine. I understand  the concept of the shadow personality and its significance according to  Jung, as well as the enneagram (although I'm not sure which type I am,  but I have a clearer idea). I clarify this to provide the following.\n\nFirst im male and adolescent, i and people have detected in me symptoms of ADHD but I was not yet diagnosed in depth, and i think that probably i got poor capacity of attention. im anxious under stress, im atheist and every person i met considers me funny, intelligent, and a person to trust. but also SOME people calls me lazy because a type of aura or something but they cant argue why i am. and in a weekend alone would be meh, useful for my instrospeccion, to think and my goals. But would be boring. i HIGHLY enjoy outdoor activities and doing sports, i have more ideas than i execute but are highly about any type of \"main idea\". so isnt that new and i attach to a goal or good idea. i enjoy leadership, and i think that in various situations im who need to take the control and im a leader that show why the group need to do that, i persuade and motivate the members to do the things for our goal. i dont understand the hands question and everything related to Se and Si, its a bit strange to me, depend my mood, if i am angry may i be selfish, but to be a good with them i help. And if is someone i love and care i do with the intentions to help. I need total logical consistency in everything i think, made and everywhere. Efficiency and productivity are pillars for me, i focus on approach EVERY opportuniry i got. im crazy about optimizing my pc, gym workouts and everything in my life to work at his max. I control others persuading them instead of saying what to do, i enjoy when a good idea that i got spread in the people... My aspirations are someday write a life changer novel and i separate that in little goals, and i have and obsidian vault with that. Or being a genius in psychology, neuropsychiatry, philosophy, antropolgy and that themes. Using that themes to maybe create an youtube channel, being a streamer like HealthyGamer also atracts me A LOT... And approach and explore the writing and editorial world with the previous themes (is also a theme, not a opportunity). I fear being critiqued, saying something stupid, being inconsistent and ilogical with my ideas and important make of me a fool. also fight with someone who i love, hurt people accidental (i usually dont do but to happened me)also i hate fake people, and i hate when people say to everything \"idk\" because isnt interesting, why you are so that-\n\ni every moment thinking ideas about my life, goals, my friends, and interesting topics that i saw. Probabilities to the future, affirmations or critique to things that i make in my mind. And im distracted with my surroundings sometimes, my friends have better eyes than me.\n\nIn a blank room i probably bore and i think about what to do when i exit, and themes that i thought a long ago and try to ideate things for my novel and remember moments with my friends.i take some time to decide something too important. i search for important arguments and i remember me that the decision is hard because the sacrificies that each make. And its very rare that i change opinion, i change opinion usually when i find out anything that i didnt know. But also see a lot how would be with the other decision after deciding.About emotions, emotions are indicator of things in me and other, are a form to communicate. They are important to me, and i try to understand where from, how to treat them, which signal they give... If im sad about x i need to accept y. I take them and avoid in decisions. Because sometimes my insecurity, anger are a form impulsive and incorrect to take decisions. But my happiness and sadness sometimes are indicators of which is the true way.I dont give the answer to the other just for keep the conversation, i do that when i dont want problems.\n\nNext, i think that the only real law existing is to everytime challenge authority. I think that we should see indepth why we follow x, or if its correct to follow y. Because something is how its, is the worst argument i ever seen.\n\nAt last, my ideal life is someday have a comfortable life, with a partner with each other love everymuch, with a nice family, sharing moments with my friend and my sons with my friends sons... Be a HealthyGamer with the job of writer and see the diplomas of psychology, psychiatry and every of that because i would be a fucking cool genius. being a bit famous... and thats it.And a fact that i admit is that i envy ENTJ, because they born to be CEO and leaders good asf but only in that... i dont dream with being a trillonaire CEO, its sounds good but i would be the same happy or much more with the ideal before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni then deepen unanswered questions.\n\nI have always identified myself as an **ENTP**, or so the tests and my function analysis have told me. However, I  started to doubt because now I am a different person, and I question  this. I possess a significant amount of Te and Ti (although the latter  was very low in the last test I took before writing this). I also have  Fe and Fi. and also i like to discuss a lot and i used to do very much.\n\nI feel that, and I know  that I primarily engage in thinking, rationalizing, and then morally  analyzing, using empathy with what I said, and correcting it  accordingly. I prioritize knowledge as a tool and something valuable,  something to be pursued for what it is. I don't know how to explain it,  but I have T! I have also felt strongly that my F comes to light. I  resonate a lot with something I read on this subreddit: an ENTP can also  use Fi, no matter how shadowed, as we are not RPG characters. I see and  notice how often I use Fi, how many times it seems more like Fe than  Ti, and more than Ne.\n\n# Regarding Feeling and Thinking\n\n**I AM VERY**  focused on whether what I do is right, on not hurting others (my number  is probably 9, 3, 2, or 1 after some tests and self-evaluation), and on  harmony with myself. When there is no harmony among others, I am  concerned if it is very close. I completely agree that people would  improve a lot if they treated each other well. But also, if they were  not so ignorant, the world is an infinite sea of possibilities that you  can assimilate. I also have an almost equal focus on logic. I always try  to have my opinion based on objectivity, using Ne to avoid hurting  people with it. But for me, honesty, truth, and objectivity are  fundamental and admirable. I am on an infinite quest to have a single  way of thinking, one that is correct and objective, which of course  changes a lot for that reason. This is wrong and contradictory because  there is not one correct way of thinking, but I work on it and am  speaking more generally. I also like to listen to contradictory ideas  and not be arbitrary in disqualifying them. I argue in my head the two  ideas, and when I can't make sense of something, I am left thinking for a  long time, and my friends tell me I am a burden and wonder why I spend  so much time thinking. And when I argue or someone gets angry with me, I  am left with a wound that takes time to heal, leaving me in shock for a  while when they say nothing happened. In conclusion, I value my  relationship with others a lot and take care of it too much. I try not  to offend anyone with my opinions and think about how they feel,  connecting with their personal problems, and even though it may sound  crazy, there are people who thank me because, according to them, I saved  them from suicide, and it was not tedious; it was something beautiful,  and I enjoyed talking to them about these topics and connecting with  them. My friends and family have said that I went too far by getting  involved in others' lives and that I shouldn't shoulder responsibilities  that are not mine. But I always felt bad for them, always tried to help  them, and thought about how privileged I am not to have their problems  and wished that something would change in their lives so that they  wouldn't suffer so much. And from the Thinking side i love figure out,  decipher systems, see their logic, get solutions, being critique and  analytical. Pinpoint any logical inconsistency, deeply analyze  everything and understand how works, by every little thing. Compare and  critique with other models, Comprend complex, asbtract models and  transform it, and this isnt a thing that sounded good for me and im a  narcisist and put everything that sounds good for me in my  personality... I take decisions based on the common good, the more  benefical rather than the prefered or that would make everyone happier. I  also as a Thinker y enjoy talking about morality, science, abstract,  art and all of that things, always i discuss with one of m best friends  of deep themes and different postures, our interpretation of something  and is a nerdy chat asf. Sometimes in parties im a on/off switch of  nerdy. From researching nerdy, complex themes hyper focused on them in  my phone, for an hour to dancing, doing crazy extroverted things and  jokes and talk with people...And last, i plan conversations with people,  i plan how would be the next, and everything. Im perfectionist with my  goals. I consider strange how i plan what to say, how to act and may try  to make it to look natural, and many times worked. I plan meticolously  what to do every step with that girl, what to say, in what situation to  end to, jokes about what, where take her, which topic that i know much  talk and ten thousand examples more. And that in all of my goals...\n\n# Regarding Judging and Perceiving\n\nI  used to procrastinate and not be so organized, but now I am different,  but NOT SO different... As a judger, I set small goals, focus on  achieving them, and thus transform them into something larger. I take  action, am decisive, and defend my decision with a stance.  Procrastinating and spending time deciding are wasted time unless it is a  real question.\n\nEven though I am  organized, I am naturally good at improvising, keeping things under  control. I plan my goals, my objectives, my days, my people, among other  things, but it's not my way of doing things when it comes to the  present. In fact, all my school presentations are improvised because all  I do is study the entire topic and don't memorize it. I explain it, but  maybe this is just studying efficiently. I am not a fan of extreme  organization, but I like to have everything aesthetic, everything  orderly, and very specific things make me lazy. Getting up to go to  school on days I didn't sleep well or going to the bathroom because I'm  watching something very interesting in a series. But going to the gym is  effortless for me, being 100% honest and sincere: NOTHING. I don't  understand why it's hard for people. But im not super planner and  perfectly organized, i think that im far of that. Except on my goals.\n\nAll of this  made me think that the test is clearly not so rigid (it is rigid if  aging doesn't change your personality and if your functions are not so  marked when they are shadowed). I thought that I am probably an ENTP  with a lot of Judging and Feeling. But with these tests, I doubt a lot,  so I want to hear your thoughts, and thank you for reading this lengthy  text.\n\nAnd i promise that im being 100% honest in this text, thats why the confusion.\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: i try to post this in r/mbti but they rejected this text without the answers, but i also want to discuss if the theory is correct because i honestly doubt about it if the things are that rigid. And also i fear that knowing about each function has manipulated me to saying thing that im not and i want to be, or that little narcisism that I only say I have. But i tried my best, and I\u2019m not a loudmouth is that calms me. But got that in sight.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vhysyqdr948c1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=167a92b3260149e4108b42a47c94e7808e25cbd4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1eatodr948c1.jpg?width=549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e18847b5e40c8b289d95aacd48e163dfd8c3ef33\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7bkox47q848c1.jpg?width=519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40bb809e1912d0f0ba236891b29a188eb25cd527\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrcxt17q848c1.jpg?width=566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e598791025140ced41707221a12bd40b2946ca0\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/j4nli17q848c1.jpg?width=471&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e1b33c83b7330ccbba42746068ec9ce7e2615ea)", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": " ENTP", "logprobs": []}

I tend to care way too much about values and feelings to just jump into any opportunity if I know it'll be bad for me/hurt me/feel uncomfortable. I do start a lot of projects just to never finish them, make plans on what I wanna do with my day just to give up, struggle with deadlines etc, but I wouldn't, for an extreme example, \"try\" something \"exciting\" which may be extremely against my comfortabilities or values. That level of impulsivity simply isn't me. Living a life that aligns with what I'm comfortable and happy with is way more important to me than making up 600 possibilities of new things to try.

{"submission": "Hello.\n\nI have been debating throughout the last few months about INTJ or ISTJ. I imagine the heavily glazed INTJ is something a lot of people would, consciously or not, attempt to be similar to, so i have been doing my best to be impartial and look at both types equally. Before INTP suggestions: i do not relate to Ti at all since i hate mental masturbation, do not have Fe anywhere and definitely have Te somewhere.\n\nI guess i would preface this saying that i'm an atheist, but i learned that after a few years being a dedicated church member, only realizing that i have been doing all of this effort to please my mother instead of actually believing in anything.

{"submission": "Hi all, I will be answering the wiki forum questions. I have taken the test a couple of times and the results are not definitive. I attempted to understand the cognitive functions but left more confused than when I started. I'm aware that my following answers may come across as arrogant and self-serving but I am just being as honest as possible.\n\nAge, Gender, General Description?\n\n* 25 Male. Adventurous, Creative, Leader (I enjoy being in charge and I often end up in leadership even when not trying), Intelligent, Perceptive, Dreamer, Active, Competitive, Assertive, Curious, Continuous Self-Improvement, Independent, Intuitive, Skeptical, Insightful, Imaginative, Logical, Innovative, Challenging, Objective, Fair, Goal-Oriented, Ambitious, Confident, Outspoken, Problem Solver, Humorous (I like to be random/ridiculous and catch people off guard).\n\nMedical Factors?\n\n* Diagnosed ADHD, combined presentation. Diagnosed in third grade, the symptoms have lessened over time. Hyperactive-Impulsive is no longer accurate in my opinion, but I still struggle with attention.\n\nImpacts of upbringing?\n\n* I was very extroverted up until about middle school. I was athletic and the leader of my friend group. However, I had a perpetual inability to keep my mouth shut when I disagreed with someone or believed someone had done something morally reprehensible. I didn't win many friends with this approach and attracted a great many bullies. I withdrew as an adaptation (obviously the wrong one). I avoided attention in order to avoid attracting more bullying. Which then backfired as I became somewhat of an outcast. Since high school, I've worked to overcome that.\n* I found school to be very easy and got A's without trying. As a result, I never developed discipline. My mother also never expected me to do chores and often helped with school projects. Very much a helicopter mother (love her though). My first semester of college didn't go very well (2.7) and it served as a wake up call. I stopped skipping classes and started completing assignments as soon as they were assigned. I studied for the first time in my life, though admittedly it was still a rare occurrence. Second semester went much better and the next three years of school I had a 4.0 and won an award for being the top ranked student in my major (but not in the college, I had a 4.0 in major and a 3.8 overall). Got back into taking leadership positions, joined a fraternity, honors college etc.\n\nCareer? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n* Software Engineer. I enjoy it. The work atmosphere is independent and relaxed. I work from home and can do what I need to do to maintain focus. I get to solve puzzles all day and build stuff that I can see the immediate results of. It's great and I'm recognized as a top performer (which surprised me, given how little time I actually spend working). The team and my bosses are awesome. Much better than the first team I was on which sucked.\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Lonely or refreshed?\n\n* I would feel lonely. While I need my alone time and time to let my thoughts wander, I like having people around and engaging with them. I get bored if on my own for more than a day.\n\nWhat is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event, what is it? And why? If not, what type of activities do you engage in?\n\n* When I'm paying attention to my surroundings, my movement is great. However, I can easily get wrapped up in my own thoughts and bump into stuff. I love active stuff. Most of my friends don't though. I have no specific preference for outdoor activity other than that I love to compete and I like variety. I play tennis and disc golf the most, but I also enjoy basketball, white water rafting, rock climbing, flag football (not trying to play contact and get brain damage, I need that thing), jet skis, surfing (rarely get to do it though). Anything active with a lot of skill expression. I hate golf though. I'll still play it with friends and enjoy that aspect, but I am very bored by the game itself. On the flip side, I play a lot of video games with friends.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - environmental or conceptual, and elaborate?\n\n* I'm very curious. I have more ideas than any human could execute. I'm curious about psychology, science, health, economics, government and much more. My ideas mostly take the form of business ideas and inventions.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n* I do enjoy taking leadership. I'm very good at it and often get great results. I'm not sure what the style would be called overall. I ask questions, make decisions, guide people, advise, delegate etc. I'd say I'm very pragmatic in my leadership style. If there is time to build consensus and help people understand why they should do what I'm asking, then I do so. If there isn't time, then I can be very direct. People have commented on how strange it is to see me switch modes in a crisis. I make an effort to help others develop to the point they can take ownership of things so that I don't have to constantly sit on them. If people have barriers to getting things done, I help remove those barriers. I give people the benefit of the doubt, but I also trust my gut. I'm pretty good at telling when people are lying and lazy. I won't act on that gut feeling immediately, but rather will look to verify that I'm right before making any moves. I'm egalitarian by default, but there also comes a time when you have to be firm. I also try to clearly define the overall intent of what we're doing so that others can take initiative on things and provide advice. I can't be everywhere at once and I can't know everything, so I love having motivated experts around me.\n\nAre you coordinated? Do you like working with your hands? Why do you feel you are coordinated or not?\n\n* I am very coordinated when I'm paying attention. I am not coordinated when I am not paying attention. I sometimes enjoy working with my hands as I like to see a result from the work I am doing.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art. If not, but can appreciate art, please explain.\n\n* I am somewhat artistic. I like to use my 3d printer to prototype ideas of mine when practical. I don't engage in any specific forum of art consistently. I like to engage in many forms, though I'm not especially good at them. Which I'm fine with. I create the art for me, so I feel no need to develop any artistic skill. I'll randomly get an itch to sculpt, draw, etc. I like to draw my D&D characters. I have a notepad on my phone full of character ideas. I draw what some of them would look like. I love art, poetry etc. However, I hate art museums (and museums in general). I get bored in them. Others have stated that I'm artistic the few times they've observed me engaging in it. An especially artistic friend of mine has stated there's potential there. But, I feel no desire to develop the skill. I feel it would be a waste of my time compared with the many other things I could do with my time.\n\nWhat's your opinion on the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n* We can learn from the past. I enjoy reading biographies of historical great people. Time moves in circles they say. But I think time moves more in a spiral, with subtle differences occurring that prevent things from matching exactly with the past. You have to notice and consider these differences if you hope to anticipate the future and choose the correct course of action in the present. Respect and understand the past, use it's knowledge, but don't let it dictate things to you today. Pay attention to causation, and only give a little weight to correlation. Be pragmatic about it.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n* Others claim I am very helpful. I was surprised by this. Upon reflection though, I realized that when someone presents me with a problem, I feel a compulsion to solve it and I enjoy doing so. However, if there is nothing to solve, it is harder to get my help. I'll still force myself to do it because it's the right thing to do, but I will internally be annoyed at the inconvenience. The only time I don't help someone is if I have something more pressing at hand.\n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n* I'm not sure what this means but I'm going to say no. Things change. What got you here, might not get you there. As you gain more information, you should modify your opinions and course of action. Now, the logical flow may be similar. You're acting on the information that you have, doing the best with what you've got. But I think there should be some evolution over time as you get smarter and learn more. So I feel no need to express the same logic today as I did yesterday, and thus my answer is no, I don't need logical consistency.\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n* Very important. I hate doing chores so I try to be as efficient and productive as possible so I can spend the least time doing them. I look to eliminate busywork where possible. At the same time, I have a great need for novelty and experimentation so I will try some things out that I'm not sure will work. If it's more efficient, great, I try to incorporate it going forward. If not, oh well, it was fun testing it. Similar with work. I don't want to get to the end of my life and regret that I spent it all slaving away for what exactly? So I try and get the most done in the least amount of time possible, so I can spend more time on what matters.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n* Yes. It's not always intentional. I just try to be helpful and useful and I end up influencing others. I find it very easy to influence other people through logic and persuasion (they go hand-in-hand). I ask questions, get as full of an understanding of things as possible, and then I make a determination and state what I think is most likely the best thing for them to do. Often, people heed my recommendation.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n* My only consistent hobbies are gaming with friends and reading. I enjoy variety and switch from hobby to hobby. I like being active, competitive, and for there to be a lot of skill expression. Currently, I am messing with wood working and learning spanish (I plan to travel to a Spanish speaking country sometime in 2024 and would like to be able to converse with the locals. I love fully immersing myself in the culture when I travel). Perhaps I could also say that adventure is a hobby of mine. I like nonfiction reading primarily because I find the information interesting and the long form nature leads to a more cohesive understanding of the subject matter. Fiction books, I typically enjoy fantasy novels because I like to imagine myself in them and to think about what I would do in that world. It's a way for me to adventure without leaving the house and spending a bunch of money.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n* I like to learn by \"interrogating\" people. Preferably there is an expert I can extract knowledge from. However, I hate sitting in lectures and lose focus rapidly. I also hate trying to learn from my grandfather. I love him, but he is old-school and expects you to learn by watching him work. I don't learn that way. Tell me what I'm trying to accomplish, let me ask questions based on what knowledge gaps I sense and then let me try things out and experiment. But, for whatever reason, asking him those questions leads to conflict and experimentation is a sin. So, in summary, I like to learn by doing while asking questions as needed. It seems to be the fastest way to do it, and I enjoy being able to immediately see the results of what I'm learning. I hate memorization, lectures and/or sitting and trying to learn by watching someone else do it.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n* I'm very strategic by nature. I break projects up, but often I only feel a need to define the end point, general stages, and the first task/objective to get going and generate momentum. Naturally that kind of approach leads to a lot of improvising as I get further into the in-between parts. Some others would be likely to say I wing things since my plans are very loose and general, I don't always verbalize them, and I prefer to act rather than deliberate. A \"good-enough\" plan enacted with confidence and speed often ends up garnering a better result than a \"perfect\" plan executed slowly and self-consciously. Of course, this also depends on the stakes. If there are strong consequences to messing up, then I will take the time to plan. As for strategy, I have a natural awareness of it and don't need to sit down and draw it out. It's more like I detect the strategy rather than that I create it, if that makes sense. When gaming, I often end up being a team lead if such a thing exists and explaining strategy/objectives to my friends.\n\nWhat's important to you and why?\n\n* Personal relationships are important to me. I feel like I see others miss the point of life all the time. The logical point of life is to continue. That's it. Life exists because it reproduces and finds a way to keep going. For us humans, this is best accomplished over the long term through valuing family, cooperation, and working to leave the world better than how you found it. I want to have a big and positive impact on the world, to make things better, and to be remembered for a long time for my intelligence, vision and ingenuity.\n\nWhat are your aspirations?\n\n* See previous answer. I have tried repeatedly throughout my life to have comprehensive impacts on the communities around me. Climate change is something I think is very important to combat. It is existential. All other issues pale in comparison. And yet the other petty issues seem to be all anyone focuses on. I aspire to have a global impact on catalyzing people to do what needs to be done to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. I know what society needs to do. However, I'm not yet sure of the best way for me to get society to do those things. I've tried multiple things with varying success. Once I am sure again of how to proceed, I will do so.\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n* I fear anonymity and reaching the end of my life just to realize I wasted it. I become uncomfortable around closed-minded people. I hate it when someone renders a judgement about something they know nothing about. They base their thoughts and opinions based on what they heard through the grapevine. They champion personal experience and yet, when you push, they have plenty of opinions on things they have no experience with. It creates a lot of difficulty in the world. I hate being confined and feeling like a minion or a pawn in someone else's game. I dislike feeling like I can't express an outside opinion without fair consideration, and especially hate when others feel that it's a reason to make personal attacks. I hate \"by the book\". I need to be able to think and experiment.\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n* The highs have been when I've been in highly impactful community positions, where I was respected, and able to make positive change. Other highs have been when my hard work in college paid off and I got the job I had been aiming for. I was also incredibly happy when I solo travelled Europe and got to interact with people who were incredibly different from myself. I've enjoyed positions where I could get creative and work with highly motivated intelligent people that would help me make my ideas a reality. Nothing big can be accomplished alone. Even great scientists are standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n* Whenever I've been forced to do things that felt meaningless. I often start to avoid work and engage in escapism through video games. I tend to overindulge in these instances.\n\nHow attached to reality are you? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n* I'm not super attached to reality. I can be very present in a group setting, but otherwise I tend to drift off very easily. I am not consciously aware of my surroundings while daydreaming, but I have very good instincts and I find I will suddenly become very aware of my surroundings without explanation until I take a second to determine what is going on around me that requires attention. My \"spider senses\" have saved my ass a couple times.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank empty room, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n* I may have a political or philosophical debate with myself or I may review my goals and dreams to try and figure out how to achieve them. I would likely spend time pruning the million different things I have a desire to do down to only the most important ones.\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n* Depends on the stakes and how complicated the decision is. If it's simple, but important, I make it pretty quickly and don't change my mind. If it's very complex, the stakes are high, and there are a lot of unknowns I tend to sit on it, come to tentative decisions, and change my mind up until it's no longer a good idea to change my mind. I am very good at thinking at the margin and determining if changing track is a good thing or if I just have to commit to something. I don't fall prey to sunk cost fallacy.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions?\n\n* Very long and not long at all. I don't make decisions based on emotions because emotions change with the tide. As such, emotional decisions can take me a long time as I try to discern an overall pattern or consistency of feeling. On the other hand, I am very good at identifying my emotions and their cause. If I'm trying to get something done but my emotions are getting in the way, I can typically figure out why and determine a way to deal with them to remain productive.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n* Not really. I won't necessarily call someone an idiot and tell them they're wrong. But I will ask them questions to poke holes and/or try to tactfully disagree by pointing out my opinion and it's accompanying reasoning. I'm fine with agreeing to disagree, but I'm not going to lie and say I agree when I don't either.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n* Not often, but sometimes. If a rule is senseless, out of date, or doesn't apply to the context, then I'm likely to ignore it. I typically understand the intent of a rule. If the intent is not applicable, the rule is not applicable. Of course, I like to keep the appearance of a rule follower. It makes it easier to get things done when people respect you and following all the rules makes others more comfortable. It's also easier to get a rule changed if you are seen to be following it.\n* I think authority should often be challenged. Rarely is someone who deserves authority in an authority position. The best people for that job, often don't want it. Sometimes though, I run into a competent and trustworthy leader. In those instances, I don't find it overly difficult to set my ego aside and listen to what they say.\n\nWhat is the ideal life in your opinion?\n\n* At the moment, it would be working on fixing climate change in whatever role is most impactful. Adventuring in the downtime. Having lots of friends. Having big dinners with a group of loved ones each night, changing who's house we do it at, and being able to walk to all my friends houses. Being able to walk everywhere really. I would be able to invent prototypes rapidly and get them patented just as quick. There's more, but this post is rather long now and I have something else to do. \"The soup is cold\".", "clean_guess": "ENTP", "llm_guess": " ENTP", "logprobs": []}

Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI did play sports when younger, wasn't too great. Martial arts clicked for me - MMA etc. that require real demonstration of skill. I generally don't like outdoor activities like hiking or climbing. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nVery curious. Tend to be creative with art etc. or project based with engineering. Generally my interests fall along those lines...technology and art. I do go down rabbit-holes like reading Jung and diving into typology etc. I like absorbing general info. I do have more ideas than I can execute but I keep a list for prioritization and eventually get around to high priority ones. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNo, I much preferred working in a dark corner making cool shit. However, I've recently had to step into leadership roles very reluctantly due to the incompetence of other leaders and I am very good at it. \n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nYes I do I like martial arts and I am fairly good at it. I also do art...drawing and sculpting etc. While I am good at these activities I am very interested in them because I perceive them as very difficult to do and as a child I was not very physically gifted. \n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nYes. I love the human form and figure drawing. Almost all my drawing is charcoal or pencil or black ink. No color. Very precise and meticulous anatomy drawings and studies mainly. When drawing live or creatively...very expressive and bold lines that try to capture the feeling of the subject. \n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nPast don't give a shit about, don't generally have regrets. Present is cool and I'm working toward goals. I tend to live in the future, strategizing and molding the present to better position myself. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI generally always try to help others at the expense of my own time. I find it hard to say no. I would help them...because it feels good to do so and I like guiding others. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes. I like my life to follow a system that is on track to improving my life in the future but it is flexible especially with systems I have little control over like romantic partners. I tend to be much less hands-off there. \n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nExtremely. \n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI do. I try not to with romantic partners, but I generally seek to control people with the attitude that it is for their own benefit. If I see a colleague for instances saying he hates a task or subject emotionally because I know and understand he has an insecurity about knowledge required for that something I will go out of my way to help him get better at this subject and do my best to cut through that emotion.  \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nArt, technology, martial arts. Love them all. Art I love because I am very interested in people I tend to do a lot of live figure drawing and translating that emotion onto paper is satisfying. Technology I love because of the infinite complexity of systems you can build to solve and explore problems. Martial arts because it is utilitarian, has great mental benefits, and is hard. It is also a complex system to solve. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI struggled a lot in school, rigid authoritarian systems. I adapted to this and became very successful, but as a child I had a lot of difficulty. Memorization is easy and I hate it. Logic/creativity are my favorite because they are harder and more useful to me. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nVery good and I prefer strategizing. In practice I tend to discover details and rabbit hole on them. But generally I'm very productive and efficient. \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nCreative and financial success. I want to bring something unique to the world that others will benefit from that is my output. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nBeing out of control with my life, being in situations where I am trapped. I've felt most out of sorts when I am in a situation like school or work where the structure has forced me to do something that there is no option for me to reject it due to hierarchical structures. I absolutely hate bullies and people that use their strength or position to harm other physically or psychologically.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nDoing something that I thought was extremely hard or fearful of and succeeding. Facing my fears and coming out on top. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nHigh stress and lack of control. Knowing that I could have done better but chose not to. Knowing that I put myself in a bad situation. Hurting others.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nTend to be in my thoughts and thinking about systems a lot. Do lose track of my surroundings if I am on autopilot, but generally in a city or walking around I am aware of my surroundings but my mind might be elsewhere. When driving I zone out completely. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nDepends on the situation surrounding why I am in the empty room and for how long I'll be there. Let's say this is just me waiting for like a doctor's visit vs something more nefarious - I would probably be out and about so more focused on reality...I would be thinking about the day and whatever engineering problem I was solving at work, if not, probably thinking about a project and what I could do with it. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI agonize over important decisions. Once I make the decision it tends to be absolute. If I can't control whether or not the decision can be reversed, I basically give it no thought at all as far as changing my mind is concerned and deal with the consequences.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI am quick to process emotions. I generally discount emotions and view things through a more objective lens as much as possible. Whether or not I feel good about something is secondary to what what that something represents. e.g. If I don't like my job it is a constant stressor, but I can view it objectively and grit my teeth and get through it if I don't have many options at the moment and in the meantime plan how to make my life better in the short term or remove myself from the situation. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes, quite often. I was a huge people pleaser to my and others' detriment as a child. I have slowly gotten much much better at this, but I am always uncomfortable if say my personal taste conflicts with  someone's strong expression of interest in a subject. e.g. person loves this movie, and I hate it -> I will default to pointing out the positives in the movie or even downplaying my disinterest - I won't lie but I will minimize my tastes or interests to avoid awkwardness. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nYes. Authority should be challenged unless that authority can demonstrate clear, objective superiority. I break rules that don't make sense and lead to inefficiencies and misery for others. When breaking rules I really do tend to break them for other people...challenging authority or ignoring/destroying a system that is causing another person (or myself) to feel terrible. I refuse to sell my soul for personal gain and I won't abide by rules that are unethical.   \n\n\nLet me know if you need more information...I usually test between INFJ/INTJ. I consider myself way more adept at reading people and I care quite a bit about general \"good vibes\" when interacting with others which is why after years of study and typing I typed INFJ. However, my interests and style of goal pursuit seems very Te to me so I have always been a bit confused about where to place Thinking in my stack. I think Ni dominant is obvious and Se being inferior makes sense (I have bouts of extreme hedonism when under stress, and it is predictable). Thinking and Feeling to me are the mystery. I am of course open to alternative takes as well if my writing suggests it.   \n\n\nTHANK YOU!", "clean_guess": "INTJ", "llm_guess": " INTJ", "logprobs": []}

(Maybe I was 2?)\n\n\nI was really scared of going to the toilets alone which meant I peed my pants a lot in class.

{"submission": "Thank you in advance for helping me :)\n\n \u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI every one, I'm 21 years old. I'm a male. I'm a Christian, web developer with 3 years of experience, unintentional charming guy :) with a deep crave to have a nearly perfectly planned life, which is: Very organize on the big picture, and very flexible on the detailed picture.\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI haven't got medically diagnosed in my life. Although, I believe to have ADHD. I procrastinate alot because \"I prefer this more than that\".... and loose focus if there is no interest\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nYes, I went to Christian churches since a child. And I end up leaving it when I got 18 years old. Although at 21 years old, when I understand the price Christ payed for me on the Cross so that I could have eternal, and the same price was payed for anyone that repent and believe Christ as is Lord and Saviour, I knew what becoming a true christian is. So, I decided to follow Christ for the rest my days, because of how mercifull he was to me 2000 years ago.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI'm a web developer. I hate it because, it doesn't interest me at all. I do this job because I was doing it for more than years, and I got very good at it. If I had the possiblility of changing career with the experience I have, I would have done robotics because I like it way more.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would feel very good only if it would help me advance in my project. If I had to spend an entire weekend by myself doing nothing... than I would get anxious. I can't just stand up and look at the sky, I have to do something. Anything, except organizing my room XD.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nYes, I really enjoy doing sport. I'm one of the best football player of my entire town, rollerblader too. Outdoor activity, I like walking and wandering about how I can update my life plans. I in those moment I can walk 3 to 4 hours long just wandering about life scenarios of all kind, mainly romance and work.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nYes, I'm very curious. Although since I got 21 (after the day I understood my salvation through Christ), things have changed. \n\nSince 16 years old, I would have hundreds of project because I didn't know what I wanted to be in life. And I was very scared on being locked up with the wrong career. I went from Computer Science to Surgury to Martial Arts... But I wouldn't ever keep on 1 direction because of that fear.\n\nWhen I got 18, I started with web development. I hated every single moment, because as I said before I prefer robotics. However, I had many projects  on different field of computer science, which where very distinct from each other.\n\nNowadays, I have many ideas, but there are all extremely related to one another, because I realised how tiring it is to try to do everything in life.\n\nMy curiousity are about project and entreprises I want to make real in order to live the free life I want, stressfree.\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nYes I would like to. My style would be \"Organized freedom\": We do what we want in the way we need to get result. If I have to be a leader about something I know very well like web development, great because I know 80% of all common problems, so no big deal nor stress. Although, If I have to be a leader in a field I don't know completely, than I will 100% prefer all the steps to be defined and the why of all thses steps in order to be very productive. I could improvise, but I need clearly defined steps and the logic/mapping/the why's behind it. There should always be a framework behind it (if possible), else I will be very tired. \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI'm very coordinate. I learned ocarina in 1 month, a piano song (good enough) in 4 weeks of practice. Martial art of many kind in weeks (because I did martial art since a child), and in dancing I have a good hand-eye coordination to imitate the person in front of me, because I generally find out the pattern behind their dance. Although, this may require more time depending on the complexiti of the dance.\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nWell... I can find the pattern behind many music and improve them mentally... I dance and sing classic-like music. I used to enjoy classic music because of how well composed it was, and would listen to it during days and days, and really enjoy the beauty of it composition. I don't know if we can consider it artistic.\n\nI used to dance very well when I was young, but stopped to do so when I began to study web development seriously. I also used to write very deep histories that would make people cry because of how deep it touched their emotions and they could connect with the character (I'm not a writer though).\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past: is feeled of very enjoyable moment of my life and regrets I reconsider many times such as very embarrasing moments... I don't understand whey I did theme :')\n\nThe present: Is here to shape my future. Although, I pass more time shaping my axe than cutting the wood...\n\nThe future: Is a very enjoyable moment I really want to get to. It is calm, perfect, everything works perfect. All my projects are working out, I can walk down the street (not necesarly rich) with full confidence, backed up by a system that is fit to me personally.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI help them right away. I can't help helping people, I'm doing a project I really like. In those case, I desappear in order to not be disturbed, because If I'm so, I will alwas help them.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nNo. I don't need so, I just leave the way I prefer. Although, I need my preference to be optimized and in order to let me live freely. That's why I'm actually working harder than what I sould, just because I want to leave a meaningful life to me. And not being influenced by anyone on earth except my mood (Because yes I hate it, but I can be very moody and unpredictable to myself).\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nEfficiency is very important for me in the End Product/Plan, to the point that I can avoid being productive because I want my project to be perfect to avoid any unecesarry stress. I don't have time to be very productive, I get productive if it is part of something i like. Ex: I use a productive Tool only if I like or or it will bring me to where I want, and I should 100% use it.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don't control people, although I influence them In some ways or the others. Ex: There is someone I like, I will be very friendly to her little brother to get closer to her.\n\nAlthough, I control people if there is a clear way to do it. I'm used to be very black or white, because it's easier to make decisions, although there are not always the best.\n\nCompared to my mom, she has an Idea and she says \"Let's do it now\". And when I look the system she uses, I'm like \"Please, Let's make things more systematized\". Most of the time she blame me for being to squared-minded (She is right). But it's because I have lightly planned what possible problem we will have in the future with the actual plan. And... most of the time I'm right. Although she is right when she says I could be more flexible...\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nPlaying instrument relaxes me, web development brings me each time closer to the moment when I will deploy my plan and live the life I want. Reading the Bible give me understanding on the world and many wisdom (I have avoided so many problem thanks to it).\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is by getting the general concept of a given subject. Looking where it begins and why it is the way it is. That why I love mathematics so much, although I'm not very good at it (However, I'm a mathetmics teacher on my free time for 4th to 5th grade); I like this learning style because I can easily be proeficient in everything I plan on to do.\n\nI struggle with environment where there is a lack of information or clear schema on the why and how. Because I feel stuck on how will this bring me to make other projects/tasks.\n\nI prefer class that involve physical sense and bit picture maps and concept. I am very bad with logic, I tend to be mentally blocked when I have to think logic  on the go, unless I know what's best/worse (Ex: Don't ask me to try to find out who stoled the wine based on some explanations, I will be mentally confused. However, ask me If I should use this instead of that, I will explain you why more easily than the previous).\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nHow good, depends. Example: If we are in an activity, I can propose a way to do things quickly and it often works. I really seldom break project into small manageable task. I started to do so whith my beb project because of my lack of time, although I just 'do one thing I can and Pass on'. I have a tendency to improvise in the way I do stuff in It for example. Although there is no risk in doing so for this kind of project because I know what I do (not all the time though...). I have hard time to put on clear steps on Do A, than B, than C because I often do more than 1 thing at the same time. I have a very hard time to prioritise tasks.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nBeing a winning competitor to shopify and woocommerce. And live the Christian life (becuase of the grace the lord had to me). Personally, well the usual: getting married, having children. That's also why I work so hard right now: my romantic desires, although it is not the only reason why. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nFears? none being sincere. \n\nWhat makes me uncomfortable: Not having peace and alone time when I need to, being told what to do because I crave for max freedom possible. \n\nHate? Not seing object in front of me, not being organized, loosing stuff in my computer, not keeping data in an efficient way possible, not being more productive/proactive, being to driven by my feelings (very moody). Being corrected (although I end up accepting correction, unless it goes against my plan). Being very forgetful.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nMy highs: I look like an extrovert, very talkative and confident, solving most problems in front of me\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nSad, not talkative. Isolated, not self confident. \n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream very often, I don't get aware of my surroundings nor if i'm hungry. I daydream daily. Even when people talk to me.\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nHow calm and peacefull it is. About the girl I like, About how my life will be on the next times (although I don't often self relfect).\n\nI don't understand the question.  \nEmotion are important to me, because if I feel bad I can't do anything (so to speak).\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI take very long time. For example: choosing a potential partner, although I have a big urge to just talk, I observe details that may impact on our future relationship. Same for career,projects,etc.\n\nI don't understand the first question. ALthough, the second question emotions influence me a lot.\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes, most of the times because I don't want conflicts. That's also happend when with someone I had to get paid by a friend but he doesn't pay me for long. I wait till I get tired and don't trust him for services (or offer him a service tailored to his need that don't require him to compromise to me, better to a third party).\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nNo, I prefer to follow rules because It help me being in piece with people, while advancing in peace my plan. Authority should be challenged when things don't work I generally don't break rules, only in case of urgency (someone is dying)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for helping me :)", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "idk about my type anymore send help\n\n  I would appreciate it if you help because i have to get this thing off of my shoulders because i am starting to get really deep into this. I am constantly analyzing everything so please send help.\n\n\nPossible test results: ENTP,ENFJ,ENFP,INFJ,ENTJ,INTP.\n\n\n\u2022How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n 19 yo female. I am a student. And i have mild ADHD which i use medication. I was doing sports when i was a child but not anymore. And there was a period of time,i played guitar but..not anymore. And..I am not good at *bam* kind of introductions so i will try to be more open with other questions.\n\n  \u2022If you spend an entire weekend by yourself,how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n Umm..Probably refreshed. But after 3 days of loneliness,i usually start talking to myself so i am not sure lol\n\n  \u2022How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiousities about? What are your ideas about-is it environmental or conceptual,and can you please elaborate?\n\n I am super curious. Like its one of my qualities that stayed from childhood. I like learning new things. Anything that isn't too related to materialism is fine by me. Languages,history,politics,philosophy,psychology.I literally just like learning. My mind is like a sponge but only takes what makes sense for me. And even tho i put all those without an order. They are actually connected for me. Like learning languages means learning new people and countries. I love researching about their histories to understand their cultures. Which leads me to politics because from history,we can see what kind of regime they used in history. Then that takes me,why people chose that regime or gone through it. Then its affects on social psychology. And that leads me to one individual. And their probable philosophical thoughts..actually they are all connected for me.\n\n  \u2022Would you enjoy leadership positions? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n I think..I would make a good leader. But i am not kind of someone who throws themselves to front for that. I am a bit modesty about getting attention to myself. I don't like having others focus on me a lot. I just want their focus on a few things. Not all the time. Probably i would be a leader who was chosen by others. And someone who tries to do the right thing for the group. I would be a bit pragmatic on leading. But at the same time,i would try to be tolerating to people as individuals.\n\n  \u2022What is your opinion about past,present and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n I think past is past. There is no use to whine about it. Yes,you may do some mistakes but..Its past now. You cant change it. Present..Sucks. I dont like it. Its probably because i don't feel satisfied with my current life. I want to be better but i need to find my reason to live. Since i started to be an adult,i want to find my own goal in life. Future is..Exciting yet scary. I have really confusing thoughts on it. It feels like..being on a ship in the middle of ocean. You go somewhere but you don't know where. It may be an island full of cannibals. Or a nice port full of other ships. I want it to be a nice port but cant help but wonder \"what if i come across cannibals?!?\" But like..I am hopeful towards future too. I will find my way in life whatever happens. So its okay. (like i do when i get lost or try a new way to home)\n\n  \u2022What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n My hobbies are reading,learning new things,surfing on internet. I love reading because i feel like reading makes someone more open minded. And..i like understanding characters and their way of thinkings. Also i really love imagining that described sceneries in book.(that's probably why i don't like movies of books because its not similar what i had in my imagination) I talked about learning a lot. And surfing on internet is just..basic. Like..I just do it because i am bored. Like surfing on redding, writing a few rps and watch some netflix.\n\n  \u2022What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization,logic,creativity or your physical senses?\n\n I suck at memorizing. Like there was a paragraph i tried to memorize for 3days and 4th day,it was gone. That's probably why i suck at physics too. I like using what i see. I like understanding the core of the things. The main information. I can write the vectors or equations from my head. I never memorize the question styles too. I can see same kind of question and use a different way every time. However my mind thinks first. It doesnt matter which way to me if i reach to conclusion. Whenever i try to memorize something..Its like some words are bigger than others. It gets my attention and i get hooked up on that term. And remember that term better. And my learning process is like..I will give an example which made me feel like a genius lol. I was in biology exam and one of the question was asking the blood pressure on different vein types. And i had LITERALLY no clue. After some time of thinking \"how can i solve this? what do i have in my mind that i can use?\" Suddenly,i remembered Bernoulli equation. I tied that information there(since there is biophysics) and implied the rules of Bernoulli to different vessel types and did the question right. That's exactly how my mind works. And as environment,i like environments who are not TOO strict or TOO laidback. And i most of the time like public schools,i like the sounds of hallways full of people. Their laughter and chatter. It feels idk..nice. And gives me sort of warmth. I like seeing people close to each other and have fun. \n\n \u2022What do the \"high\"s and \"low\"s look like in your life?\n\nMy highest was..When i was 13-14. I was mentally sucked. I was depressed and wanting to die. Surviving on chocolates to release some serotonin and feel happy. But my other aspects was great. I had a friend group. I was studying my classes and be one of the top kids in class. I was doing great with my teachers too. I was literally doing great. Except my mental health but i wasn't minding it that much. Because the other things i had was what is was striving for and i was living them. That was my 19 year life's most successful two years.\nMy lowest was..last year and the year before that. At first,i was studying for uni exam nicely. Then suddenly my test results started to fall. And i panicked because i was doing what i had to do. And i felt like i was going to fail. And i pushed myself more. I didn't sleep proper,i was too obsessed with fixing my results. But they didn't. Eventually i accepted that i sucked. And some teachers said \"Do whatever you can\" (btw that idea sucks because it fucking limited my potential) And i failed to put things together. Next year, this time i was more dedicated to make things work. And im an enneagram 2w1. I was socializing and trying to get my perfect life. And eventually started developing an eating disorder to feel in control and be perfect. But at the same time i was doing literally nothing to put my life on its way again academically. I was studying whenever i felt like and do nothing but calculate calories and obsess over how i look like. And the thing was..I was detaching myself from other peoples helps. Because i knew this was something i had to solve. I was knowing that i was the one who was putting myself to that state.(and this was what was breaking my heart more)\n\n  \u2022 Imagine you are being alone in a blank empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n (This looked like a fun question that's why i choose this one hehe) back to reply..I would probably think like this \"Wow..Why am i here? Is there a way out?\" *Starts checking around for a door. Realizes there is none* \"oh shi-there is none..\" *sits down and talks to herself* \"I should find a way to outside.\" *checks more for hidden doors but none..pouts and sits back* \"well..damn..\" *starts talking to herself* \"i am bored..what should i do know..maybe thinking about why i am here,who was the one who put me here..\" \nI would probably try to yell if someone hears me or smth..Then eventually go mad because of boredom. Start singing and talk to myself like there is an imaginary friend there. Maybe meaning of life or trying to guess who locked me there.\n\n  \u2022How long do you take time for important decisions? And do you change your mind once you made it?\n\nDepends. But most of the time,i listen to people i respect and find valuable opinionated. Like my dad and my math teacher..Who helped me in life to be better. I would ask what they think. And think about their opinions on the decision and make a decision based on what is right and better for me. And most of the time,i don't change my mind a lot. Even sometimes, my dad tells me that i am starting to be lazy. And i become super hardworking for a few weeks. When he thinks i got my lesson,bum! I do become lazy again lol\n But like..In any decision i made,i never ever felt any regret. I mean it wasn't the best decision but it was my own. Of course sometimes i say to myself to not do the same mistakes but its not like i feel an immense regret. Its past now. I cant do anything to change it anymore.\n\n  \u2022How long do you take to process your emotions? How important they are in your life?\n\nTo my family,i am really emotional. I dont share my worries or sadnesses to anyone but..I do cry after getting criticized. Because..I guess it feels like they are rejecting me because of being me. Idk really..Emotions are kind of..useless..At least that's what i think of them most of the time. I cant help but be realy vulnerable about my emotions yet at the same time,i can say they definitely aren't what i need in life. But on outside of family,i am someone who shows positive emotions most of the time. I am smiling. And be kind,sweet,caring,compassionate. But..I dont like showing negative emotions. To anyone.(my family is included in this too)\nIt feels exposed. And feel like i just..am a disaster. It feels weak.\n\n  \u2022Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged or they know better? If you do break the rules,why would you?\n\n I don't break rules if i do see its purpose. I mean if a school says \"stay quiet in class\" you should. Okay a bit of talk is alright. Everyone likes talking. But like..a lot is too much. I like things in balance. Some talk,some silence. But sometimes,i do break rules because its doesn't makes sense to me. If i cant see the purpose,i will ignore it. My dad mostly explained why he does specific things to us or rules them. So i always followed my dad,knowing his actual goal. And his actual goal was me being a strong woman. And i followed it. If it was something simple,i wouldn't actually care about his rules. But i decided being a strong and intelligent woman was a good goal to have. About authorities such as parents and teachers..I do think \"If you cant beat them,join them\" Stick to their side and listen them. Until you get better than them. When you are better than authority,its up to you to ignore them or keep stick around. I don't know..I prefer to still respect them because i learned a lot from them. But its not like i will listen everything they say and follow them like a puppy.\n\n  \u2022What are your aspirations?\n\n My aspirations are..being a strong woman. I don't want to be someone who is seen weak. I want to be someone who has a nice job and makes her own money. Someone who rules her life and does the right thing.A woman who is intelligent and smart. A woman others would love and respect.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\nHello Everyone, thank you in advance to read me.\n\n\nI'm having hard times to define whether I'm an INTJ or ISFP. Because I have hard time to realize whether I use my FI more Consciously or Unconsciously, or maybe because I have hard time to understand the concept of conscious vs unconsciously and whether the more unconscious correspond to Dom function (ex: too often use Dom function that you don't realize it) or Tertiary/Inferior (ex: too tired so you rely on these functions).\n\n\nI have read some articles about INTJ and ISFP, and because they both use the same functions (and because I'm not self-conscious enough), I tend to look at both as having the same traits as I can 'shortly' observe in my day-to-day life.\n\n\nLet me give you some insight on what I believe to be relevant on the case:\n\n\nWhen I was younger (16 yo), I had very hard time to decide on what I would do on life. I felt very lost, because I wanted to have my life planned out right in front of me, doing something I would enjoy for the rest of my life. Although I used to pass more time playing video games, doing Roller Blades (which I was really good at it) and playing football (also great at it) that I end up forgetting about it.\n\n\nI started studying computer programming and web development. Something curious is that this is one of the field I really hate in my life. I always told myself, 'I will never do this'. But right now I enjoy every single time I pass on my computer doing my own project. However, these level of excitement tend to go down and crash if I don't have a long-term reward, that progress day to day, and that I like.\n\n\nAll my projects are sorted based on my level of interest of it and the potential i find to it. Even if the project is super lame, I always find out the way to switch it to the best project the world have ever known (After 3 years of programming experience and hard time, I'm already planning on dethroning Shopify and WooCommerce...)\n\n\nOther details: I tend to distance myself to people very quickly, based on some observed pattern I registered in my mind (ex: If you act to me X, you will do Y, so I don't want you in my life). Even if there is a potential relationship, whether friendship/romance/partnering etc. If I smell a single once of 'There will be a problem here', I tend to sabotage everything in a very passive way, and just ignoring the possibility. Then in some future, I will be like \"Well, maybe it would be different because now I see that this is different\", and I end up with a 'Well, that's life'.\n\nI like to explore a wide range of possibilities (in programming), although I always end up with the one I like, except if this doesn't let me finish my project (choosing a unique tool till I find out that it doesn't get me to anywhere). Ex: I used to reject a tool called Python just for the sake of rejecting it. And right now I'm using it, and deep down I really want to keep rejecting it and use a way better tool called Golang. Although, deep down I have this very deep desire to be proficient to very few tools, being a Virtuoso of it, that I just tell to myself 'Sticky to it and stop complaining'. And although I hate it, I thank myself it is the best decision at the moment.\n\nMost of the time I consider myself a genius (in humility I'm speaking) because I tend to grasp every single complex idea, and break it down into so simpler that I can explain it to people (that's why, although I'm a Math teacher, although I'm very bad at it. Don't worry, my students got very great at it since day one so to speak).\n\nI'm not interested in Everyday details such as Fashion, Cars, compared to all my folks. I wear something that I need to and my style vary on 'Classic' and 'Smart Casual'. I choose everything based on why I like, but I don't tend to be nitpicky on things that are categorized as 'I like this'.\n\nI don't like to talk to my plans because there are very personals to me. Most of the time, If I talk about something personal like my plans  (the most personal thing to me), means I consider you inoffensive (both as a business competitor and a mocker). Although, If I tell you about what these plans mean to me, then you are a very close person to me. Although, this 'ranking' can change at any time if you changed your behavior out of a sudden.\n\n(**TL/DR;** I have hard time knowing what people are talking about without context) I have hard time to understand stuff that are explained without a certain degree of blueprint: Ex. You talk about your family genealogy, that sister's aunt's mother's... If you draw it to me on a board, I will have a great time mapping it out. Also, when people talk about something without a defined context, I'm lost. There should always be a defined context, otherwise I use the most proximate context based on (that's why often people think I'm stupid, until they find out about my projects/knowledge)\n\nWhen I was younger, I had a hard time to put my plans into life. Finishing projects. Right now, I have 1 projects in mind, vaguely defined but well-kept in me, that I'm working into. And I'm working on it. \n\nCould you help me to understand what is my personality? I want the info so that I can better understand myself and become more productive. (I'm 21 yo by the way). I wrote this post so quickly that I didn't have the time to organize it. I tend to organize when I have time, else \"Let's just pass by that mine camp, we have no time for the sweeter road\"\n\nThank you for reading me", "clean_guess": "INTJ", "llm_guess": " INTJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "One description that appears from time to time that I think a lot about is how I often get compared to a large shepherd dog, like a German Shepherd. I am described as loyal, vigilant, trustworthy, and reliable, often aim to protect those I care about from figurative and literal danger, and at best I can be rather versatile. But on the flip side, I am also described as nosy, suspicious, occasionally belligerent for an imagined good reason, (like a guard dog) surprisingly impulsive (like a poorly trained dog overeating) and occasionally too much of a follower. I think that description does fit me very well. Another similar analogy I have heard is the swiss army knife. Same idea, versatile and reliable, but lack direction of my own.\n\nRelated to this, I have realized recently that I like to be a collector. This shows itself in the obvious ways of collecting cool objects and trinkets, but also in collecting interesting contacts/allies and information. I rarely have anything to directly do with them, but I like that I have them and if someone I care about like a family or friend or boss I respect need help, I can easily pull these collected resources out to assist.\n\nI hate having to do something that is open ended like exploration or innovation. I wonder if lacking my own direction is often related to this quality. Investigation is a bit better, if just because investigation often has a specific goal in mind that I can always tie back to, but I am not good with creating my own goals.\n\nI can be very analytical but also empathetic, though if you asked me to pick one I would go with empathy. People are the most important element in any problem.\n\nI tend to be rather tactical rather than strategic. This is something I hate admitting to because who doesnt want to be the mastermind? But no, I have historically not been very good at planning for the long term. What I am good at is short term planning that also requires a lot of contingencies so that no matter what happens things play out more or less to our favour. I also would rather do and act more than planning. It feels too abstract.\n\nI trust my direct experiences a lot, to the point where when I was a kid I was scared to even close my eyes, unwilling to trust the probability that everything will be fine and I do not have to react to situations. I also trust memory and past precedence over arguments of what could work.\n\nThough I mentioned I can be analytical, I think it should be noted that I am more logical than factual. What I mean by that is I like thinking and learning about rules and procedures of what is considered correct, but I hate learning specific factual details. I dislike memorizing history dates and statistical income averages for this year, but I do like learning how people figure out the age of an artifact or how people conduct survey.", "clean_guess": "ISFJ", "llm_guess": " ISFJ", "logprobs": []}

How and why do you do that?\n\n**No, my motto is live and let live.**\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n**Lifting, running, archery, MMORPG, anime, manga/manhwa reading. I like the first 3 because it builds my body from many aspects and I kind of release my stress with them. The other 3 is just interesting.**\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n**I like to learn in total silence without any interruption. If there is any noise then I lose my focus easily. I like theory but I like to put it into practice almost immediately to strengthen the new infos. Mathematics and thermodynamics were my favorite. During learning I'm always speaking, moving and doing hand gestures.**\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks?

Why?\n\n**I have a fear about total social collapse, so I'm starting to get into prepping. I always feel that I'm not prepared because anything can happen. I hate responsibilities that other people enforce on me.**\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n**I'm funny as hell when something good happens.**\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n**I'm irritable, try to find peace and if I can't be alone then I \"explode\".**\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n**I daydream a lot, but I'm always aware my environment. I never drop anything, and I never bump into objects.

And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n**Well, I was thinking on my gamer laptop for 2 months. I always compared specs every day if I really make the right decision. Now I have to buy a car... I'm thinking about it for 3 months now and still couldn't decide which brand... Once I have made my decision and went through with it then I don't change my mind anymore.

{"submission": "Hi, I am 18 and a female. Here is the description summed up in points.\n\n1. I am a bit asocial and lazy.\n2. Before doing something even a little bit risky, I think about it a thousand times and then few times, I don't think about it and jump in.\n3. My attention span is pathetic, but if something intrigues me I will study or read about it like I am addicted to that topic(Mostly it is educational and related to science)\n4. People in general are passionate about doing one thing in their life, but I am passionate(and I mean it) about like 4 or 5 things.\n5. Even though by default I am physically very inactive, I push myself to exercise, not just for the sake of it or to be healthy and fit, but to be competitive and strong.\n6. As you may get a clue, competitiveness motivates a lot.\n7. My face is almost always inexpressive and a bit serious, and then sometimes I will have a smile without realising it.\n8. I like to connect various concepts to innovate(Idk the right word for this) if I find even a small link between them. Like, for example, DNA is basically is the code or the program of an organism, so can we in future alter our genetics through programming languages? Could it be the key to connect AI to our consciousness? Is it the key to Cyborgs or immortality. Sounds dumb but that's my crazy mind.\n9. While studying, I zone out a lot. To the extent that I start to procrastinate.\n10. I subsonciously just relate and connect a lot of unrelated things. Like for some reason, my mind says 2 is the number or represents the colour red. Idk how I got here, a picture of 2 written in colour red came in my mind and it \"looked suitable or suited it\".\n11. Now intuition(not the mbti definition but the mainstream one) is something everyone so I don't think this will help, but somebody asked me to close my eyes and guess the number written in the blackboard and it was between 19 to 25. So a picture of 23 written in the blackboard popped up in my mind and I just said it. And turned out be correct. But I don't believe in my intuitive claims and tend to overthink and analyse.\n12. I am good at planning, but pathetic at following it.\n13. Even though I am good at planning, half of the time I just do things spontaneously in bursts of energy.\n14. People say that my body language is like I am always in a rush even when I am not. And as far as I have seen, I fidget a lot.\n15. I hate to do things by the book and try to do them by myself.\n16. I really love the concept of classification and that is what made me interested in mbti.\n17. I just don't want to read the theory and want to build and see them happening in real life, even though I suck at it.\n18. I think one of the xNTP types is mine with ENTP fitting me a lot but high Fe and impulsiveness of Entp and introversion makes me think that I may very well be Intp\n\n\nThanks for read folks!

{"submission": "Ok, so generally I prioritize homework and studying above having fun. I go to the gym consistently for my mental health, and my roommate thinks I\u2019m insane for how often I go. However, I have family members in the army and most of my family is very health conscious so I actually feel very unfit even though I regularly go 4-5 times a week for intense running/weight sessions.\n\nI am a woman, if that helps at all. I am also very religious, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell from my personality at all. Most people are very surprised when I say that I am Roman Catholic, and I have most of the Bible memorized. I get along really well with people in LGBTQ and other communities, until I mention that I am Catholic. We have a very similar sense of humor and self-deprecating sarcasm despite our very contrasting beliefs.\n\nWhen I am not studying (on break), I like to watch Marvel, Star Wars, and other movies. I will watch dating shows or rom coms with my female friends who like them, but when they sit next to me and their leg presses against mine unconsciously I feel awkward. I don\u2019t really like subtle physical touch from any sex during a romantic show or under any occasion (unless it\u2019s my future husband LOL).\n\nI really like single player games, like Super Mario Galaxy. I also like games like the Sims 4, and I actually sometimes make people I know in real life in that game. I\u2019d never tell them though.

{"submission": "She is my cousin. I met her for the first time when my father made our family go on a vacation to Michigan in summer 2021 to visit my extended family. \n\nI remember that, although she spoke to me, she did not seem particularly chatty. She had actually seemed kind of quiet, though I remember she responded to the small talk I made about school and the like (I remember she apparently had good grades in school like I did. She suggested, I think, that she was thinking of attending college for dance or attending a dance school, but this never ended up happening - I don\u2019t know if she just didn\u2019t apply, or if she didn\u2019t get in. Actually, from what I know, she has not enrolled in college out of high school, and has a job working at a fast food joint, I think it was McDonalds. She still had enough money saved up to buy a car from it even though she more recently turned twenty though.) I remember she looked at me and told me to not let the kids at my school put me down and call me ugly, that they\u2019re \u201cjust jealous\u201d (and I think that she and potentially another cousin suggested racism was/is likely a factor, as we are black and unlike my cousins I live in an area that has a low black population.) Her mother had apparently described her as not having many friends at school, and suggested that a lot of the girls they live around are jealous of her/do not like her (some months ago my father suggested in conversation with my mother that another girl, or group of girls, had more recently broken my cousin\u2019s car windows.) I recall that when we had talked last, about a year ago, she suggested that she might enroll in college if she had the time (she more recently suggested, like maybe a month or two ago, when I checked in on her when she sounded upset that she\u2019d actually like to go into the field of cosmetology. She had worked at McDonalds and possibly another fast food joint, but has more recently been working in a restaurant. This was what she said: \u201cYeah I just be bored and irritated shit not moving fast enough for my liking\u201d \u201cSo boom my job it\u2019s decent but it takes along time for 2 weeks to come on top of that I\u2019m getting overworked then not only that if I quit I\u2019ll have to start over from scratch it\u2019s irritating\u201d \u201cA restaurant & yeah going to cosmetology school I want my own hair salon\u201d and when I asked her if it\u2019s possible for her to apply to cosmetology school for the spring semester in Michigan: \u201cProbably\u201d\n\nI remember she had mentioned on one of her stories in the past is that she eventually wants to have a child, particularly a boy/a son (which is the kind of mindset that I don\u2019t like very much in other women.) She also had a Tik Tok wherein she suggested she is glad to have not gotten pregnant in high school/to not have a baby yet or a pregnancy scare like many of her peers have had. \n\nWhat interests me the most about her are her relationships. When I first met her in Michigan, our other cousin had suggested that she has \u201chad boyfriends\u201d with a nod of the head (and also used this observation to note that me having not had one yet at that point in life and being called ugly a fair amount in my area - I was 16, a year younger than the cousin I\u2019m talking about - was due to racism as opposed to me being legitimately unattractive.) I notice, and have noticed, within the past year that she tends to have a *lot* of them, even though she is slightly below average facially (and this had surprised me, when I first met her. I realized that her having a conventionally attractive body helps, and that if I lived in Flint, Michigan I may have an easier time.) She has complained about them multiple times, and more recently complained about getting a guy a Christmas gift just for them to break up (but seems to be with another guy not terribly long after that.) It doesn\u2019t seem that many of them are legitimately *longterm* relationships, and even though she has complained about them in the past she never really stops getting into them. She also suggested more recently that she \u201cwants a thug\u201d (or something along the lines of that, on a story.)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/18rjntv)", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}

I like to dip my hands in a bit of everything when it comes to my community. When you see me once, you start seeing me everywhere. I'm a huge doer--when I get an idea in my head, I immediately dive for it!\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. \n\nWhen there wasn't structure in my upbringing, I learned to take care of myself. When there was, I often retaliated, because I had already figured out how to handle myself without their help, why would I need it after that? \n\nI hated church. I thought it was pointless because I never believed in god. My dad wasn't religious until he married my stepmom who was an ex-mormon and very strict about religion. I didn't respond to her rigidity too well and would fight her every Sunday to stay home. I was honest, I didn't believe in god, why should I have to go? I fought tooth and nail for 7 yrs until I was around 15 when they finally gave up.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career?\n\nI'm still a student but on track to get my MSW by '25. I'm a community coordinator, a volunteer at a nonprofit, and an intern for my school's counseling office. I love the work I do.

Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nAnything where I can get my hands in something, like scupting, or physically going somewhere new and beautiful to take pictures, listening to music and going for a walk, writing, singing, playing guitar, crocheting... \n\nNot sporty in the slightest, but I do enjoy hiking, nature walks, and stargazing (I'm a nature freak and a space case!)\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? \n\nTough question. I don't have more ideas than I can execute, at least not consciously. There are things I feel that I can't quite put into words, but I express those through the arts. Most ideas I have are environmental, but there are some things that are conceptual, like my worldbuilding when I write.\n\nI have an internal framework I can apply to many things. I see patterns in everything, and it keeps me from asking questions because I believe I already know the answer. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? \n\nI am in many leadership positions, and I LOVE it! I always knew I'd be good at it, because I am a very big-picture thinker, but I also see the paths to get to the big picture very easily. I give a set of guidelines and the end goal and let my colleagues come to me with questions, and take over whatever they can't handle themselves.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? \n\nI am a planner only when I want something. Otherwise, I think best on my feet, but I can come up with an action plan instantly with the information I'm given. So, yes.\n\nI am extremely hands-on, always, in everything I do. I cook, I write, I sculpt, I draw, I do tech repairs. My love language is physical touch!\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI live in the here-and-now. The future is the goal, and I can set it and forget it basically.

If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nUsually I will help anyone in any way I can... physically. If they need a door held or some groceries carried or help moving, I'm their guy. I can give objective advice, but I don't really consider myself super empathetic, so I don't think I'm the best for emotional support. I help people because I like to! It's a nod to the shared human experience; I'd hope they'd do the same for me if the roles were reversed.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes! My internal logical framework is very stable, but I wouldn't call it rigid. \n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n...Eh. Productivity and efficiency only matter if I care about what I'm doing. If I do, I am incredibly efficient. Otherwise, I don't really care.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI guess in a way. I am 100% always without a doubt in control of myself, and when others try to take that from me, I can push them in another direction. I am also very blunt and upfront with communication, and sometimes my abrasiveness can be mistaken for being controlling.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nPhotography - love conveying the beauty of the world and feelings I can't describe in a visual way\n\nGuitar/Singing - helps me express emotions I otherwise struggle to express\n\nWriting - creative outlet, expressing emotions I otherwise struggle to, get to express the patterns I observe in everything, has helped me process a great deal of trauma\n\nCrocheting/jewelry making - love creating something physically I get to see/keep forever and share w/ others\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style?\n\nThrow me right through the ringer! I'm a fast learner. Teach me something once, I remember it forever. I struggle IMMENSELY with classes that are slow and repetitive. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing?\n\nI think I could be better at strategizing. I make up things as I go most of the time, but when I sit down and actually plan, I make something I'm proud of. \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI want to be a teacher/mentor ultimately. I could see myself doing anything related to social work, but my real goal is to guide or help people so they don't share the same experiences I did. I want to show the compassion I wasn't given, and I want to treat my students like complex humans who have lives outside of school. Even if my time with them is just a break, they would learn how to pass that compassion onto others, and that is enough.\n\nPersonally, I want to travel. I love new experiences and being tied to one place feels confining. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? \n\nMy biggest fear is losing control. Feeling trapped. Putting my life in someone else's hands in any capacity. \n\nI hate when people aren't honest with me when I am always honest with them. I don't lie. I see no point in it. I'm not a mindreader. Remove yourself if you're uncomfortable. You don't have to be nice about it. Talk to me about it later. Tell me \"I don't like when you do that.\" \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nMy highs are when I'm in the moment, taking every day as they come. New experiences, new people, new opportunities. I love living to the fullest, otherwise I can get bored.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nAt my lowest, I retreat. I draw completely inward and interact with no one. I feel like I'm out of control and don't know how to get it back. My drive is gone.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? \n\nI am incredibly grounded in reality. I don't daydream often. I am always aware of my surroundings when I daydream. I pay attention to everything.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nHow to get out? If that's not an option, my stories and characters. I'll sing. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nImmediately. I don't change my mind. I trust my gut, always.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? \n\nEr... it takes me a while. I don't feel things in the moment usually unless I sit and think about it. I logic my emotions out in my head as they're happening. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? \n\nNo. Never. Not unless my gut tells me I'm unsafe.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? \n\nYes, because I think I do a better job. Many rules are arbitrary and put in place as guidelines to keep people from being stupid. I think everything should be questioned.", "clean_guess": "ENFP", "llm_guess": " ENFP", "logprobs": []}

Why or why not?\n\nI don't have a job, I'm a student \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would feel lonely most of the time but I would try to deal with it. Plus I think it would be nice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI hate sports. I love art and I love finding new things to learn (and then drop until I can dump all the information and make myself seem smart) I love psychology too like typology but I wouldn't call myself a nerd\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm very curious, maybe too curious. I have SO MANY IDEAS but never execute d it. My curiosities can be anything, it's based on what I'm interested in and the situation I'm in\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI would like hate leadership roles, I like when people listen to me but i hate the stress. I would kind of good at it although I might be hesitant with new ideas and I get pissed of easily which can scare people. Honestly, I don't know what's my leadership style since I'm always hesitant to take the role \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n100% not. I hate working with my hands. I rather think than do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI'm artistic I think. I often draw, sing and dance. I don't know how to describe it but I'll try. It's usually a mix between semi-realism and anime. Sometimes I draw something meaningful, especially painting but usually I draw to practice!  When I sing, I try to copy the sound of the singer or a singer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past haunts me a lot, I regret things easily and it lingers. But I'm forgetful. I deal with it with distractions because I don't want to think about it. I made a lot of mistakes and I can't change it so I wont. The present is boring, I never appreciate it, I never focus on the present. It just passes by. I'm scared of the future and what will happen. I am either really optimistic or pessimistic. I plan for the future but it never happens so the present becomes disappointing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIt depends. I help them willingly or I become pissed. If I decide to help them it's for repaying them, genuine kindness or I just feel like it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nHonestly, I don't know. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nProductivity? I'm never productive. I am a procrastinator. Efficiency? I am very efficient because I'm so impatient. I try to do things efficiently (but accurately... Usually) sometimes I take my sweet time doing things nicely though! But I'll run out of patience \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI usually try to persuade them with explaining my reasons. I feel the need to control things because I don't want anything bad to happen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nArt because I really like to brainstorm with it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI don't know my learning style. I struggle a lot in very quiet environment and very noisy environments, I like a bit of chatter but I don't want people to talk to me because I'll forget about work and talk with them. I like classes that involves logic, explanations and involving students although not when they are shouting \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI improvise and wing it as I go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI want to help overs with their emotions and how to be the best versions of themselves. I want them to manage their own emotions, live the best life and solve problems easily \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI hate doing the wrong thing, I hate certain textures, I hate inaccuracies and I hate ignorant people. \n\nI hate doing the wrong thing because it will affect me incredibly. I hate certain textures because it feels weird and it just disgusting. I hate inaccuracies because it spreads misinformation and it makes people do the wrong thing. I hate ignorant people because they are so clueless, they spread misinformation and they act like they are better than experts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nHappiness and being reckless. Having fun. I feel fit in and hope it lasts forever. I would be too optimistic aswell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nDepressing. I feel anxious, alone and a disappointment. I feel like I don't fit in and everything bad will happen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI am quite attached. I daydream so much. I am kind of aware of the surroundings but I wouldn't pay attention to it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nHow bored I am and the meaning of life. Maybe my past and my mistakes. And also the future and what would I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI take a long time to make an important decision out of fear something bad will happen. I usually change my mind after unless it's about emotions (I don't even know why myself) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nIt takes me a bit to process my emotions. Emotions are as important and logic to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? \n\nI don't necessarily agree but just accept it so we don't get into arguments or I'll argue with them. These options happen equally \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't break rules often but if I break then, it's probably out of spite or it's because of me procrastinating if it's work related or me being reckless when it's behavioural. I think authority should be questioned so we know why we have to follow these rules and to see if these rules are actually necessary\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(if I didn't answer any of the question, please tell me) I think Im a entp but I could be bias", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "\\[lol please don't run away because it's so long\\] \n\nI am a nineteen year old female who is currently at university studying chemical engineering. I have been interested in typology for a while now, and have started reading more about cognitive functions, and so on. I understand each of the functions, how they work, and stacking, yet I cannot seem to type myself confidently. \n\nI've be lucky enough to have a few people type me recently, yet I am still on the fence about confidently leaning more towards one. \n\nI can say with certainty that part of my stack includes Extroverted Feeling and Introverted Thinking. However, I am still unsure about if I am more Ne or Ni, and Si or Se. \n\nMany of MBTI I've been typed as include INFJ, ENTP, and INTP. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI have been diagnosed with social anxiety in the past (when I was thirteen), however, I didn't find it to be as impactful on me as most others describe. I just found myself struggling not to over think every interaction, or think to much of it to the point I was just obsessing over something that wasn't really true (I'd think strangers were mad at me as I'd usually overthink how they acted or spoke, I would also overthink about my actions and how they might have been perceived as rude. Though this was never really the case). Now though, I believe it's less of a problem. \n\nI still get sick sometimes at an event when it is located in a place I find really familiar. I just hate it when a place I am so used to, suddenly changes into something else. It feels like I'm getting the ick (lol). Even as a child, sometimes I'd get uncomfortable when lying with my parents, or hugging them. I'm not used to it so I just tend to dislike it, and prefer it to be how it normally is. \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy mother's side of the family is catholic, but my father's isn't. My cousins and grandparents were really involved in it, however, I never really felt any strong opinion about it. I personally don't consider myself catholic, however, who am I to say God doesn't exist. The times when I did go to church, I found it hard to be involved, or feel as devoted about it as my family, since I didn't really have an understanding. However, I found that because most of the family I grew up around was catholic (and were kinda strict), I found myself being more conscious, I didn't swear for a while, let alone ever dare to, I used to sometimes also remind myself if what I was doing aligned with what my family believed in. Though, I've slightly started to be more myself, as that was more so when I was a child.\n\n(I mention more about my upbringing later).\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI am a student (whoo). Do I like it? Meh, it's necessary so I don't really feel to deeply about it, it is what it is. Disliking it wouldn't do anything, I mean, sure I complain, but who doesn't? \n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would feel fine, I could do what I want freely without having to worry about other people constantly (i.e. my parents coming it and telling me to do chores; cause that sucks), and I'd have an array of different and possible things to occupy myself with. \n\nI'm not sure if this is helpful, but growing up I was kept in a rather contained and strict environment, not strict-strict, I just never was able to socialise outside of school or sports. I was conscious since a young age about my parents, and I never had it in me to ask to hang out with others, thinking they would just say no. I was really independent, and I think that was because I was left alone a lot as a kid, no siblings (until I was 10), and all my other cousins were at least four years older. I found myself having to entertain myself with my imagination. I think that is why I am so fine with being by myself, I'm just so used to it. I also think I matured at a very young age, which would explain why I'm so childish now.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI play a lot of sports, why? I don't even know. I've played baseball for seven years now, and I myself wonder how I played for that long. I don't find much interest in the people, it's really tiring, I also hate enduring it, yet I've continued to play for so long. I never wanted to get anything out of it, like trophies or a career, I was just told by my sports teacher when I was 11 that I was good, though, this wasn't true, he just needed to recruit players, so I ended up signing for it. I also did other sports because of my friends who were involved, they participated in baseball with me, so I only found it fair to play their sport as well, even if I didn't like it. The thought of it sounded nice, yet in practice, I wasn't as happy as I was in a high school science lecture. \n\nI like being indoors by myself, and outdoors with others. I find it awkward sometimes to be outdoors by myself, like I could never go to the park and throw hoops by myself, I'd just feel that others would think of me as odd, and I really just didn't see the appeal. I think I kind of have a dependency on others to do stuff with me, like going to the gym, I would hate going by myself, and go when others do. \n\nI hate feeling dirty, wet, and itchy though. Like when I did this gardening thing at my old high school, I hated it. I mean, sometimes I'd go without having a bath for a day or so because I just couldn't bother, but when I'm wet, dirty, and itchy, it's the end of the world. Because of this, I usually like indoor activities, like gaming, researching, etc. \n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI have a lot of ideas about things people could make that would be a hit product. I won't share any, unless you pay up, but I just see so much opportunity in random things. Would I ever set out to make these things real, probably not, that's not really my thing. I'd for sure help someone achieve it by sharing information and being the \"brains\", but I just wouldn't be the \"do-er\". They are random as well, I remember one ages ago was a dish washer that was vertical (instead of putting the dishes in horizontally, the dish washer would be in the counter beside the sick, and opened so dishes can be placed vertically right after washing. I think this is a thing though now). \n\nI also think of ways people could better improve systems, like at baseball, I see so many ways they could improve the club, clubhouse, advertisements, coaching system, equipment, etc., yet am I going to do anything? No. I would share my ideas, but that's only if I'm actually interested in the club's success, and if I want to talk with that person. If I find that they're not really giving as much to me as I am to them, I am not likely to talk about this sort of stuff. \n\nI also am curious about how things work, I remember as a kid I was always asking my parents about stuff, it was always the \"How does infinity work, how does something not end, but also end at the same time?\". I always wanted to know things, and felt rather disheartened when people found my interests useless, and got annoyed by my thirst for knowledge. This kind of ties in with the fact that I don't really like it when people don't get what's beyond their line of sight (narrowmindedness). For instance, when I'm talking with someone about the possibilities of something, and that person has no interest, or says I'm wasting my time thinking about something like that and instead should focus on what's in front of me, my willingness to share my interests with them decreases. \n\nMy ideas as well, are normally good, and kind of whacky sometimes. Like, I would consider myself pretty good at solving problems with what I've been given. One time, a key on my laptop keyboard broke, and there was no way to use it. We didn't have any tape, so I used a clear plaster to stick the key on, and it worked perfectly. I did this in five minutes, which I would say is pretty okay. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nDepends who I'm with. Normally though, I'd stray away from a leadership position, but if it's needed, then it's needed. When I was the captain for my baseball team, I'd often find myself considering how everyone feels and often asked if they were okay with my decision. In group work, I hate it when I have to constantly check up on someone to make sure they're doing their job, I feel like I'm nagging. Though, when it is really important and last minute (normally under stress), I don't mind having to. I also have found over time that it's best I stay away, since sometimes I get really perfectionist tendencies/have a certain preference. \n\n(I also seem to come up with better ideas at times (at least in my opinion) about how something could be, yet some people struggle seeing my idea's potential. Which is why when I work by myself, my ideas gain a lot of praise).\n\nOne time, we did this group project and the boy who made the PowerPoint......... let's just say I could have done it so much better, and the fact that I couldn't chewed away at me in my mind. I seem to be really picky about that though sometimes regarding work. My document (and so on) setting must be appealing to me, and organised, and cohesive. However, this is just some fixation I have on school work, I don't really see this elsewhere in my life. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI mean, from playing sports I gained a lot of coordination, balance, and stability, however, naturally I have really shaky hands, so it often doesn't work out. I mean, I can be quite dexterous when it comes to art, I've gotten a few awards in the past from my high school. Some for paintings, sculptures, mask-making, and one for dress-making (which was group work). But besides that, I don't really do much hands on work.\n\nI can catch really well, throw really well, hand-eye coordination is good, and I'd say I'm pretty okay at gaming. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI kind of talked about this above. But in high school art I was pretty good. I loved it as a kid, I don't really remember why, but I did use to love the praise.\n\nMy art is a depiction of what I find to be ideal to me. I remember, there was an odd occasion when I got a lower mark for an art work, despite it looking good, because it didn't align with the style we were given. \n\nI remember taking up a lot of different activities to make myself better in a way then other's in my family. I mean, since I was a lot younger than everyone, I was often teased for things like this, so I remember trying to be good so that I could beat them. I also used to want to be the ideal child to my parents, and did a lot of things thinking about them, and would often conclude that I would be okay, if they were okay with me. However, I slowly matured from that as I got older, however, now, as funny as it sounds, when I'm away from home I worry about them and if they're doing okay. I sometimes feel sorry for not being there with them, and can feel guilty if I go out without them. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI often think about the future a lot. I remember when I was younger looking at apartments for rent, furniture, and random stuff that I liked, and took screenshots of them. I liked to plan out how I wanted to live, even from a young age. I remember doing a drawing of a house and farm with all different animals, and said \"I want to live here when I'm older.\" \n\nI also think about it a lot before going to events. I like to think about all the possible things that could unfold, or things I should take into consideration and act cautiously about by using what I know about the event, similar events in the past, and just some random connections I found might be related to this circumstance. \n\nI don't know if this is because of my social anxiety or what, but I always wanted to have some sort of an idea of how something would turn out. Yet, at the same time, there were occasions where I just couldn't care less. I'd just go. \n\nAlso, when talking about the future, I am able to pull of plans quite well as I consider all aspects of something. \n\nFor instance, just say I'm trying to steal some of the sweets my mother leaves in the fridge. She has them in a tin can, when I open it I obviously know nobody is around and I take note of how the lid was positioned. I take the sweets out, close it exactly how it was before, and put it in the same position. When she notices she's missing some, I tell her that I don't like those sweets, and when that flavour is ever brought up, even out of context, I make sure she knows I don't like them. This way, when I steal them in the future, she won't consider me. \n\n(This was an example, never have I done this, I just came up with this to explain what it's like).\n\nThere are also times when I can predict how someone is going to act, and then I prepare myself for the interaction accordingly. One time at baseball, we had a bunch of balls all on the field and this lady was walking by. I could just tell she was going to pick up one of them and throw it over to us so I just watched her and waited. And boom! She did it. \n\nRegarding the present, I don't think I cherish it enough as I should. I don't find myself thinking to much about how I feel in a moment, and certainly don't often think about how I'm going to cherish this later on. I don't search for much meaning in the present, instead, after looking back on it I then find meaning or what not. \n\nIn relation to the past, I have a pretty good memory in regards to things like that. Knowing my way around a shopping centre, no clue. But what I did, said, heard, felt, and so on ages ago, I remember. I also am good at remembering facts, details, and pieces of information I might not have consciously tried to remember or placed any importance on in the moment, but somehow did take note of. I find myself also bringing up moments from the past in conversation, and relating them to when we're talking about. For instance, when I was talking with my mother once about something, I brought up a random moment from a holiday we went on together years ago.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nDepends who they are. If I'm comfortable around them (i.e. my sister, or my friends who I know won't take offence), I could easily say no, even just as a joke. However, normally, I find it hard to say no to others (i.e., strangers, or unfamiliar people) requests, and often help them, sometimes at the expense of myself. \n\nLike back in high school, I remember one of my classmates asked for help while I was working on an assignment that was due that afternoon (which I had procrastinated on doing), and chose to help them, even though it took the entire lesson. \n\nWhether this is my social anxiety or not, I don't know. That's why I find it hard to work out my functions stack. Do I have high Fe? Or am I just really anxious? So many questions... sigh.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nDon't really know what this entails...\n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nDepends what we're talking about. I know a few of my family members and friends who are Te dominant, say that I can be really inefficient. \n\nFor instance, I take my time doing my chores sometimes, or I do something the hard way because that is how I wanted it done. \n\nThough, at times, I find myself being nit-picky about other people being inefficient. For instance, when I see a clear solution to a problem, and a person who has not yet seen it and is blind to it, for some reason it can bug me, though this is only when I get stressed I think, and usually only in relation to my younger sibling.\n\nProductivity? I mean... I procrastinate a lot. Sometimes I have random resolutions to be organised, yet I never follow through with it, just like an routine or schedule I make, even lists, I barely pull through with how it was planned. Normally though, when its really close to exam season, I start making really in depth planners and study schedules. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI think so indirectly. I mean, when I try to bring up a topic I want to talk about, I will lead the conversation that way, and wait for the person to pick up the ques and talk about it. I do it really subtly. But by no means do I try to control how someone acts, or what not to an extreme extent, I just do things subtly that eventually lead to the outcome I wanted. Like when doing labour work for my father, I've noticed that when I start to look really tired, but continue to work hard, he gives me a break, or will let me off the hook. So I then purposefully do these things. \n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nHonestly, if it was an actually hobby, I'd want it to be searching the internet freely, doing whatever with it and so on. It's just so fun, I can do so much, I can research things, learn things, watch things, and more. \n\nWith studying and sport, I don't have much time to do a hobby, and I haven't really tried out anything besides what I did in high school which was art, music, and dance, however, I never really felt inclined to do them much personally, I just figured they aligned well with the model child. Art was okay though, I've started to get more of an interest in it again. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nIN RELATION TO STUDY:\n\nI really like it when I am told everything I need to know, or an outline of things I need to know, so then when I do my own studying I can build my knowledge around it. I like learning about things I find interesting, and can relate to other things. For instance, I really, really, like science. I find myself talking about it in random scenarios. For instance, when my mothers bottle exploded in our freezer, I explained it was because when the molecules expanded due to cooling (because their structure becomes more definite, compared to gaseous molecules which are pretty free moving. Basically just explained solidification) it built up pressure in the bottle. I hate learning English, as it can be so open ended, and my mind just runs wild. There are so many possibilities in English, that I find it hard to focus, and often my essays can be a bunch of random thesis'\n\nLearning styles, I don't mind memorization, or practical activities, however, I would just rather take notes and be shown the experiment. But that just might be because I'm lazy. \n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI go in with a plan sometimes, which ends up in me realising I may have gotten to ahead of myself, and start improvising, or sometimes I just improvise, and sometimes I just strategize and it works. \n\nDo I break projects up into manageable tasks? Sometimes, however, I don't normally follow up with how I planned for them to be done. Sometimes I start one part, and move to the next, come back, start a new part, and I've gotten no concrete progress, only a bunch of started things. I also sometimes get better ideas after diving deep into related material, then I build off what I originally had to improve it. I also find that I can get more stressed when I try to break things up, even though in the end it may have actually helped. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nDon't really have any. Personally, I want to move into my own place and get a cat, or a dog, or both. But I don't have anything set out that I want to achieve or anything. And I'm still trying to navigate the life of a university student who has to pick their career, which is challenging enough to choose. How will I know if this choice is what I'll like in a few years time? It's kind of like that. \n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI hate whipper snippers. In every possible way.\n\nWhat do I hate? Hm... I hate narrowmindedness, or I dislike it when a person feels so strongly about something, and consider themselves right to the point they neglect all other factors, because their bias. \n\nI hate it when people can't try to act tactfully with others. Those this is really bias of me, (call me a hypocrite) but there are also times when I find it attractive. It really just depends on who you are.\n\nFears? Not to sure. \n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nWhen I am really happy it's because I'm able to talk with someone who listens, challenges me, gives me insight, and so on about a topic I really like. It's just the best feeling in the world when this happens. \n\nAlso, during the odd times when I actually want something to turn out a certain way and it does. \n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nWhen the people around me don't find me interesting, use me for my knowledge, or forget me. I remember this one time in high school, there were four of us in a class, one was away, and another one was leaving early, the last friend who was staying, begged for the person not to leave as they would be all alone in class, even though I would be there. That's when I started to lose interest in that person, and didn't think of them so much anymore. I didn't take much offense, since I'd prefer it if people would just tell me how they feel to save us both the trouble, but yeah.\n\nAlso, I sometimes get overly picky about my appearance. I'll start watching what I eat, how much physical activity I do, however, even though I do this and become highly critical, sometimes I do nothing but just observe. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI daydream a lot. I am often more stuck in my mind, especially if I find it to be more interesting than the situation I am in. Though I've noticed, despite being in my head a lot, I can remember details or things I saw later on, even if I never recalled them in the moment. \n\nIt really depends though. Sometimes, when under stress I can be really aware of my surroundings, like sounds, actions, and what not, and can be especially sensitive to how people act, that I get conscious. \n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nAnything, it could be about a whole lot of different things.\n\nThough, it depends. Was I willingly in the room? Or was I forced in there?\n\nIf I was willingly in there, I'd probably think about my current fixation. Like right now, my friend introduced me into anime (as funny as typing that sounds, like \"introduced me\", pfft, who am I?) and I really like to think about it. And then anything related to that, or not. My thought process could lead to anything. \n\nIf I was forced there, I'd probably think about why, who, how, ways to escape, possible reasons as to why. How I even got here. Anything that could have led to this. Etc.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nA REALLLLLLLLLLY LONG TIME. In all honestly, I'd rather always console someone else to help me choose. My honest reaction to having to make an important decision, is procrastinating. Saying I need time to think it over. I just find it hard to commit I think.\n\nEspecially in regards to my MBTI, I was never confident enough to say one more so that the other, cause I felt I might of had underlying bias, or ignored a possible factors, and I'd hate for it to be wrong. I was introduced to MBTI when I was younger, yet only now have I really gotten deeper into what it is actually like. I remember trying to act a certain why, or like a character I liked, and therefore, whenever I took personality quizzes, or thought about my results, it was always different. It always depended on someone else (fictional or not). \n\nDo I change my mind? Sometimes. I don't really have much to say about this. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nEmotions? I don't really think much of them, or about them. But regarding others, I feel uncomfortable when speaking deeply about them. I just don't see the appeal in finding comfort in others, or sharing your sob story. I'd rather keep that to myself. When others are sad, I find it hard to console them in a typical \"Are you okay?\", \"It's going to be okay.\", \"Want to talk about it?\". I'd rather try to change the subject, lift their mood by being funny, talk about something they like, or offer solutions. Sometimes I find it hard to sympathise with others, however, I've noticed when people getting angry, I often too get angry for no reason. Do I show it outwardly? No. But I feel it. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI suppose a lot. However, only if I don't really feel interested, or comfortable around the person. Also, around high Te users, I do this. I don't know why, I've just noticed it. \n\nThese kinds of interactions tire me out, and bore me. \n\nWhen I really am interested, is when we're able to bounce back and forth, keep up intellectually, and challenge each other. I don't know why, but I often like to be the smartest person in a room, and therefore I also like to have debates with others to show this, especially if I like a person. I want them to view me as intelligent, and beat them.\n\nHowever, I don't know if it's because of my social anxiety, but I don't often feel like I'm just able to openly have a debate like the stereotypical ENTP, despite being flaired as one. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nNot often do I break the rules, because, unless there is a reason to, why would I? To cause trouble? Maybe at home, or in an environment I am comfortable in. But other than that, some rules are fine left unbroken. I mean, if it's a terrible rule, or could be better a certain way, I suppose I'd allow more leeway for myself, but besides that... \n\nAlso, authority isn't that important to me, it doesn't place them higher than someone else. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm not really expecting anyone to read all of this, if you did... I give you permission to call yourself the best person on this planet, but it was really for me to lay my thoughts out and see if it would help me type myself. If someone happened to come across it, it would be my lucky day. \n\np.s. Thank you if you did, genuinely, I know how much time it would have taken.

{"submission": "Hi guys, I need help. I used to think I\u2019m ISTP or INTP, even ENTP, given my tendency to be pretty blunt when speaking and my awareness of how others feel, but placing logic first. But now I\u2019m almost 100% sure that I\u2019m Fi dom. I also posted here once before, but I was in a pretty shitty mood, so it really affected what I wrote there. In any case, I share many characteristics with both ISFP and INFP so at this point, I\u2019m not sure about anything lol. I\u2019ll try to write a brief description that might help. I would appreciate any answers.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nNow, I mostly live in the moment, here and now. However, at the same time, for example, from the moment the holiday starts, I begin getting anxious about it ending, which makes me unable to fully enjoy it. I\u2019m usually not really \u2018there\u2019, if that makes sense. There are often moments when my mind is genuinely empty \u2014 absolutely no thoughts, just existing, which I would say is very Se. But I also daydream sometimes way too much, to the point that I don't care about what happens in the real world because I just stay in my head, creating stories and everything. I almost never think about the actual world or feelings that are actually mine, which often leads to ignoring the real problems completely and being clueless to what others think of me; but still, I\u2019m sometimes extremely depended on what others think, like it\u2019s actually my biggest fear. \n\nI deeply appreciate beautiful things like art, poetry, and such. I used to draw all the time when I was younger, so if we go by stereotypes, this, I suppose, suits more ISFP characteristics? Other than that, I love writing in a sophisticated way about feelings and descriptions of places more than making stories with an actual plot; making metaphors and connections, taking inspiration from other people and stuff that somehow just comes to me. Oh, and if that helps somehow, I think I often make decision based on my past, but then again \u2014 isn\u2019t that obvious that everyone is shaped by what has happened to them? Yeah, questions like this make it really harder to determine my actual congitive functions personality type, and I feel like I\u2019m a completely different person everyday. I don\u2019t know, but one thing I know for sure is that I do have some kind of intuition in the \u2018not MBTI meaning of the word\u2019, meaning that I always sort of know what kind of person someone is the moment I meet them, and I connect their characteristics to people I\u2019ve met before, which makes me understand them better. I think I usually make decisions based on what has worked before, and for this reason I hate new things and changes. \n\nIn any case, I write without planning anything other then scenarios I made in my head before; the ideas mostly just come to me as I write. I almost always leave school homeworks and learning for the tests for the last moment because I never feel motivated enough, seeing as I don\u2019t have much plans for the future that I would aim to achieve. Once I lose motivation, the informations don\u2019t register anymore in my head, and I usually start doing something else, sometimes even stuff that I normally never do. I\u2019m indeed a professional procrastinator, and I usually need a push from the external world to actually learn or do something. I sort of stopped caring and don\u2019t deeply think about things that seem meaningless to me, which is right now almost everything \u2014 I just let things happen, take things as they are and going with the flow. Oh, and while learning, I typically connect the new informations, especially for subjects like history, to what I\u2019ve learned before \u2014 focusing on what sounds similar or related concepts.\n\nAnyway, the problem is that I used to daydream all the time when I was younger, and most of my problems back then came from my mind playing tricks on me. I was always convinced that others secretly hated me and that all the small actions and words, which had nothing to do with me, did, in fact, have something to do with me. I didn\u2019t understand people who didn\u2019t think of things as deeply like I did, why they weren\u2019t so affected by things and could be so heartless. But now I\u2019m exactly like that. Now, I just don\u2019t care. I have nothing to think about because I just do not care in the first place. It\u2019s kind of depressing, but it also changes my personality. In fact, my only friend who knows me for like three years insists that I\u2019m an INTJ because I stopped being so emotional and sensitive like I used to be, and I became even more of a loner and sort of an antisocial in the past few years. Actually, I was like this when I was extremely young, so I guess the process is repeating lol.\n\nLol, sorry for ranting.\ud83d\udc80\n\nAnyway, other other than that, I feel like it\u2019s almost impossible to determine the functions based on just a text anyway. But it\u2019s been bothering me so much lately, so yeah. Oh, and I\u2019m not a grown adult, so perhaps my congitive functions aren\u2019t fully developed yet? Or maybe I\u2019m completely different type altogether? I don\u2019t know, I would be thankful for any answer. If you need to know anything, just ask me.

{"submission": "\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nDefinitely inclined to help. I do so because I'd feel bad if I didn't. If i know however, that the person asking for my help won't even say a thank you afterwards, I'll probably make up an excuse and deny.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes. I have a very analytical and rational nature (which might not always be apparent because i have a light-hearted demeanor) so i like it when things make sense to me; if they don't i feel annoyed and distrustful.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIt's of average importance ig. In many areas of life it's definitely needed but it sometimes tires me. I don't struggle with it though. If anything, I'd say i am a very efficient person. If there's points in my life that i think I've been unproductive, it messes up with my self-esteem.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nHaven't thought of this ever. I don't like pulling the strings, it's tiresome and meddlesome, both words i am not fond of. I like persuading people to do stuff though, but it usually doesn't  have a negative undertone to it.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMentioned them before hahah, should have seen all the questions again. Most of my hobbies do have this creative elemennt to them. I like them because they give me the chance to give a little piece of myself in the songs, the stories. They're also a chance for me to get away from the ordinance of each day (with books it's the stories themselves, with writing it's that i control the outcome of stories comforting to me, with music playing, it calms me physically and mentally). \n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nProbably a visual learner. I haven't faced any big trouble with the learning environments I've come in touch with. I'm not a fan of memorization because it's boring, but i am good at it. I like classes that involve logic because it's interesting to notice patterns etc and classes involving creativity because it's personal and can be more liberating. You also have to uss your imagination and think outside of the box.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nDepends? I set a general outline in my mind and work my way around it, trying to stay ahead too. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI want to have a job in the translation field. The ideal would be to translate movies and books, both things that are joyful to me. I think these artistic and entertaining interests are sometimes entrapped in the limits of their language snd it's not fair; fun and art should be for all.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nPublic humiliation, making the wrong choice, commitment, needy and overly emotionally expressive people, not being useful, failing my ambitious dreams, not finding true love. Obviously more but these were the first that came to mind.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nEnergetic, not disappointed if i feel I'm not close with someone, accepting the turbulence of human relationships, not irritated by others' perception of me, insightful remarks.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nWorried people are against me, purposefully bitter to others, overly sensitive, can't deal with criticism, not happy for the success of those close to me.\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream, yeah. Not extensively, at least i don't think so. Sometimes I'm paying attention to the world around me without realising I've been doing so. I daydream mostly when i am alone.\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nThe reason i was there and how to get out, most likely. Would probably start feeling claustrophobic. Give myself some action movie, main character lines and then worry about the room again. Curse myself for not randomly carrying anything with me. If a certain issue is troubling me at that time, think about it.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nUsually a lot but there have been times I've been impulsive in decision-making. I always worry I'll change my mind so i have a tendency to leave things open-ended.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI process them unconsciously. I know what i am feeling but the minute it's admitted to myself, i start rationalizing it so it looses its intensity. Many times i think my emotions instead of feeling them.\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI usually stand my ground. It's a little hard for me to pretend and agree with something I don't. How can a conversation go anyways if different opinions aren't shared?\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nIf I disagree with certain rules and i know that breaking them won't affect me or the collective in a negative way, I break them. I've never been put in am environment where i felt rules were too many or too strict so the need to break them was never extremely heightened. I believe authorities should first prove themselves as decent people to earn respect and not base their worth on the power their position gives them. Generally indifferent to authorities, leaning more negative.", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I'm not referring to my prior post, retyping everything now. \n\n* \u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n   * I'm 35 (think I'm probably older than most here)? Female. Average height/average weight - pretty simple in my style of fashion / hair / makeup but also like to be fashion forward. I try to keep it looking effortless but still chic.\n* \u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n   * No diagnosis. At a time (in my early 20s) after a really bad breakup I believed I had borderline personality disorder but never got it confirmed. As long as I'm not in turmoil, I'm pretty even keeled. \n* \u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n   * Only child to overbearing parents (I recently learned they did want more and it wasn't possible, so I think that had to do with the helicopter parenting). Even though I was an only child, I had a lot of cousins my age and our family was closed / lived near each other so I mostly had a fun childhood. But my parents grew up poor (both children of immigrants) and were the typical boomers who worked hard and wanted to give their child more than they had but didn't know how to express love aside from materialist things. Also, they were fake religious and tried to give the impression to others that we had a perfect household even though there was definite verbal abuse (to each other - not me) and at times they definitely hated each other / should have gotten divorced. They are OK now but I think it is more of a \"we're stuck together we mind as well try our best to not hate our lifes.\" More complacent than happy.\n* \u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n   * I'm a civil engineer - I like it because it's something different every day. Some days it's in office problem solving, some days it's on a construction site. I personally have never had an issue being a woman in a male dominated industry though I think others may have had issues with some stuff I have dealt with.\n* \u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n   * Refreshed. Whenever my husband goes away for a weekend I rare seek out company (maybe a dinner with a friend if it's 3 or 4 nights, but anything less I usually will spend alone) and usually spend the time alone. \n* \u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n   * I grew up playing sports (volleyball, softball and swimming) but have been out of practice for at least a decade. I go in waves of working out regularly and then not - usually I will have to join a high intense class (orange theory or kickboxing) to stay motivated - I rarely can do it myself - I'll quit when it gets too hard. I do enjoy hiking in perfect weather (not too hot or not too cold).\n* \u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n   * I am not very curious about ideas but I do like learning. Sometimes I will fixate on something - using current events as an example; I have been reading about the history Israel/Palestine conflict to better understand it. When Matthew Perry died I read his book to try to understand more about him. \n* \u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n   * I am in a management position and am not very good at it because I am not confrontational when my team makes a mistake and I am not a good teacher. However I do excel on the client management side of the equation, my clients trust me very well.\n* \u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n   * I think I am coordinated but I am also clumsy.\n* \u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n   * Not at all. I much prefer history museums over art musuems.\n* \u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n   * My own past present and future? I try to learn from the past and not reflect on mistakes I've made. I very much try to live in the present but sometimes get lost thinking about the future.\n* \u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n   * I rarely will say no even if I don't know what I am doing.\n* \u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n   * Yes.\n* \u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n   * Extremely important. Non-efficiency is probably my biggest pet peeve. \n* \u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n   * I do not purposely control others but I am a very likable trustworthy person and can often get away with laziness or a mistake just by saying \"sorry!\" I am definitely aware of this and use it to my advantage.\n* \u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n   * Trying different kinds of foods, seeing comedy shows, watching documentaries about anything and everything, or listening to true crime podcasts. All of which helps me to explore, learn, or stay entertained. I love to city travel and immerse myself in different cultures - opting to spend a week in a new city versus one or two nights and then going somewhere else. My\n* \u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n* \u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n   * I am able to break up enjoyable tasks (such as planning a vacation) into manageable tasks but for most of my work life I wing things as I go. I work poorly when I am not under pressure if it is something I do not enjoy doing. I do my best work under pressure.\n* \u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n   * My aspirations are really just to make enough money to feel comfortable in life and be able to travel with my partner.\n* \u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n   * I have never really thought about this question - I guess when people ask me personal questions. I also believe I can read people well and hate people who seem untrustworthy or fake.\n* \u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n   * Traveling and immersing myself in another culture. Going to the beach and floating in the cold ocean on a sunny day. Getting a facial or having a spa day. Eating delicious food.\n* \u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n   * Feeling overwhelmed about things piling up on my to do list and having a panic attack (either in work or personal life). Waves of depression feeling like I am not where I should be in life (35, renting, no children \\[though I'm not even sure if I want so that's another conversation\\])\n* \u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n   * I am very attached to reality and rarely daydream. Sometimes I will spend an hour researching fake vacations that I will never go on unless I win the lottery (which I don't play).\n* \u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n   * I probably will go to sleep.\n* \u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n   * It takes forever for me to make an important decision but I rarely change my mind because I have thought about every single possibility and all of the ins and outs / pros and cons associated with it.\n* \u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n   * I am pretty even keeled and emotions are not important to me nor am I good at connecting with others if they are going through an emotional moment - if one side of the seesaw is ecstatic and the other is depressed I live 90% of my life balancing on the \"content\" part. Things have to build up immensely for it to tip to the negative side and when they do (maybe once or twice a year) I will have a crying fit. Rarely does the scale tip to the \"ecstatic\" side unless I am eating the best bite of my life.\n* \u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n   * All the time because I do not like confrontation or arguing. The one exception is my partner as I am more bold around him. \n* \u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n   * I live a pretty vanilla life to the bystander but have dabbled in some rule breaking here and there. I would dabble more if I didn't have a fear of being caught and being exposed as not a vanilla person. I care very much about appearances.

{"submission": "Through my own research and understanding of MBTI I have typed myself, however I'm looking for others' unbiased opinions to confirm or deny my conclusion. \n\nHere are answers to some questions I thought may be relevant. \n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n\nI'm autistic, high-functioning/low support needs. \n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI was raised in a religious home, and despite never having believed in God, I have only recently been able to leave the religion (or cult, it's debatable). One might call me the pride of my extended family, due to my academic and overall success. Therefore, my parents are now more lenient with me, allowing me to make decisions independently and are more forgiving of my distant tendencies. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI do this most weekends, despite living with my parents and younger siblings. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI certainly have more ideas than I end up accomplishing. They're frequently ideas for novels, as I read and write in my spare time, so I believe that would fall under 'conceptual'. However just because I haven't acted on many of these ideas doesn't mean I don't have the intention to in the future. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI don't enjoy leadership positions whatsoever, and usually try to avoid them. However, apparently they call to me, because I end up in leadership positions in nearly any group activity/outing I participate in. I'm good at assigning people tasks based on their strengths and weaknesses, even if I'm unfamiliar with them, and often work much better behind the scenes than carrying out work myself. I tend to find myself going around and completing small tasks myself in which aren't up to my standards if completed by someone else. If I recall correctly, when looking into leadership styles in the past, it was determined that my style is 'authoritive'. \n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nMy focus is on the future at nearly all times. I know what I need to do to reach my goals, and have the next 2 years planned out in further detail. That being said, I am good at concentrating on the present, handling situations as they come. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes. Very much so.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI dislike procrastination or beating around the bush. I highly value efficiency and productivity. \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nDaydreaming is not something I generally do. However, it is possible that I have Aphantasia, and this is something I am currently looking into. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI often like sitting alone to think about how I will approach upcoming events in life. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI'm quick to make decisions, but think them through thoroughly. I very rarely go back on them. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nEmotions are something I struggle to recognise, and as such they can sometimes interfere with life in ways I can't predict. They usually don't play a big role though, as I prefer logic over feelings. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI often humour people if I know they're wrong or someone I don't care to correct. If it's a person I care about, or if I'm worked up, I can and will disagree if necessary. \n\n\n\nI'm happy to answer any further questions or take any tests necessary.

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nFemale, mid 20\u2019s. Fairly active lifestyle. Studying philosophy. I\u2019ve been reading cognitive psychology for years and can accurately \u2018type\u2019 people, but I was never able to type myself because I can\u2019t look at myself with the same indifference as others when I watch their behaviour. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNeurodivergent (age 5). Anxiety, OCD diagnosis in 2014 that has been sub-clinical since 2019.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nI come from a small family with relaxed values. Religion was not a prominent factor in my upbringing. I\u2019m estranged from my family from my dad\u2019s side. Parents are divorced; overbearing, controlling, abusive father, codependent mother that didn\u2019t want to \u201cbreak up our household\u201d. They had an unhealthy relationship that impacted me negatively growing up. \n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI used to work at a diplomatic mission as a translator before starting my studies. I\u2019m a full-time student now. I enjoyed my work and I was good at it, but I did not find it fulfilling intellectually. Research suits me better.\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would definitely feel lonely, regardless of how busy I am. At times I feel like I get tired of people, but two consecutive days without seeing or talking with anybody? I\u2019d feel miserable. My ideal day would include both solitude and companionship. Solitude reserved for my intellectual pursuits where I am free to dive deeper and deeper without any distractions, and companionship to \u201ccome back to life\u201d per se.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI love reading (I know, shocking). I\u2019m pretty good at swimming. I enjoy basketball even though I\u2019m kind of terrible at it. I like table tennis. I like doing cardio and boxing to release stress. I dance to feel more connected to my body. I lift weights to feel strong and capable. I reserve long walks for thinking and daydreaming (with music).\n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI\u2019d say I\u2019m quite curious. I feel like I can feel wonder towards pretty much anything. I\u2019m curious about random things that I had overlooked before, or even things that are \u2018odd\u2019 to think about (eg. I was wondering how uranium tastes like a few days ago). To matters both physical and metaphysical- I have a lot of curiosity. I enjoy exploring ideas for a book, or an article. I find myself able to generate a dozen ideas about a given topic at any given moment.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI would be wary of a leadership position, but responsible with my duties. I would perform best in an interactive leadership where everyone is acting in accordance with values and priorities we all determined from the very beginning. I am in the administration of a club at my university and that is my \u201cmust-have\u201d. With other clubs I see a lack of coordination and scatteredness because they have lost touch with their initial mission; everyone seems to be acting out of their own needs. No leadership can be effective if there is no unanimity. And while people will always have individual values and intentions, they need to be reconciled with that of the group if we want to do anything worthwhile \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nCoordinated bodily? Somewhat; playing the piano or video games I feel coordinated enough. Dancing though, despite enjoying it, I feel like my movements are always too rigid. I have trouble \u2018letting myself go\u2019 and moving with the beat. I fear I would look drunk or misshapen if I did. I really like weightlifting and bodybuilding. I can retain form and focus on a few things at once and it comes really naturally to me.\n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI\u2019m an amateur at art. I have a photographic memory and can picture things I want to draw, but I have little practice so I always get disappointed. If I could draw however I wanted, I would mix realistic portraits and form with abstract colouring and motifs (I imagine myself being able to draw art like what Veronique Meignaud drew for Dishonored\u2019 Delilah). I enjoy \u2018sublime\u2019 art that frightens as well as fascinates. I think art can come in many modes; I see anything that gives you aesthetic pleasure as being a form of art. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past is something that I run away from, I feel like. I begrudgingly accept that it\u2019s what made me the way I am, and for the most part I do like myself. But sometimes I remember how miserable I was for most of my childhood, barely had friends, barely ever felt safe except in my own headspace; remembering that fills me with a profound sense of hurt and injustice. For a long time I wanted to get revenge from the people who hurt me repeatedly, and even now I am shocked to see them go about their lives like nothing happened. Like they never made my days a living hell and like they never left a lasting mark on me when they knew what they were doing was wrong. I vowed to myself that I would never be so foolish to be vulnerable around anyone ever again. The future is my \u201csaviour\u201d, as looking ahead and hoping for better times is what kept me going all this time. It also somewhat scares me; I fear that I may never reach that future. The present is something I sometimes happen to realise I\u2019m living lol.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI used to want to help whenever someone asked for it; now I know better, pfft. Of course not everyone who asks for help is going to take advantage of me, but people that I don\u2019t know at all asking me for favours is jarring to me- partly because I myself wouldn\u2019t do that unless I really had to (and I\u2019d feel very apologetic for asking) and partly because what they\u2019re asking for is usually something they themselves could have done if they paid enough attention (although you could attribute that to my limited experience and context: they usually asked for notes or homework answers. You answer once, they expect you to do so the whole semester). If I do decide to help someone, it\u2019s because I trust them to not take it for granted, and I know that if they helped me when I asked, it\u2019s not because they see it as a favour I need to repay in the future, but because they know I would never take their help for granted either.\n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nNot particularly; I think trying to actively be in line with logic throughout your life is not only impossible but it is restricting. Whatever happens in your life will form a consistent whole eventually, when you look at all that\u2019s happened in retrospect. Events that had looked arbitrary and scattered will end up looking like they could not have happened any other way. Is this consistency logical? Or does it look logical because it is consistent? \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI\u2019m neutral about it; I don\u2019t seek efficiency at every part of my life, but I do think it\u2019s necessary at certain situations/professions, etc. I do believe that trying to optimise your life for ultimate productivity is misguided if taken to the extreme and harms the quality of your life by turning you into a living robot. I think our society is at fault for making us feel guilty for wanting to live slowly. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don\u2019t think I control people, because I never intend to. If I wish to persuade them I provide them with reasons why I think some option is better than the other. It\u2019s up to them to decide, but for their good I hope they at least choose the option that is most beneficial for them. I notice that people often don\u2019t make decisions based on themselves but the opinions of their circle of friends, family, their expectations; I think the human thought process is very convoluted, and our sense of self is at the periphery rather than the centre of our decisions.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI don\u2019t have as many hobbies as I would like. I value my comfort a bit too much to go outside of its zone. I need to \\*really\\* be convinced this is something I want and will be good for me. Right now, I read, write, go to the gym, listen to music, walk- they seem ordinary, but I don\u2019t happen to do them out of necessity; I live them like it was a complex/passionate hobby.\n\n **\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**  \n\nExample: I am best at interactive classes that allow students to participate. I was a top student in Science and English. I didn't like maths because it was too meticulous and memorisation based. I'm good at memorising, but I'd rather I didn't need to. I like open-ended questions based on interpretation. Creativity, shown by the instructor or by student initiative, is a must for me to be engaged in the class.\n\n **\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**  Example: I have a general idea what I need to do to study for my finals. I begin working on a random topic, I get into the details and let them crystallise as I go along. I look at the clock and it's been hours. I did one thing for a long time, but I did it really well. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI don\u2019t have a specific, quantifiable aspiration, where I know the exact place/position I want to be at. I just want to be at a place where I am free to do what I want, I feel safe in my surroundings, and I am in a place where people respect each other. I want to be good at what I do, excel at it, even. I work hard, but I love my field so much that working feels like playing, too. \n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI fear failure, definitely. I fear being betrayed and hurt by people closest to me, being alone and unloved. I fear dying before I can see what I can become. I fear being stuck where I am, because I don\u2019t want to be. I think they\u2019re pretty self-explanatory.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nExample: It\u2019s our department\u2019s tradition to go to a pub after a successful presentation. I\u2019m new at this school so this was my first time going to the pub with them. I met a lot of new people. They were curious about me, and me about them. It felt nice connecting with them. People were enjoying themselves and I was not feeling out of place at all. We were drinking, laughing, getting into random debates. I feel like I was truly living in that moment. I looked at the bright faces around me, felt accepted and safe. It made me tear up a little bit lol. Someone asked if I was doing okay, and I said I was happy. It made me happier to see them smile at that.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nExample: A close friend of mine had passed away and I was depressed 3 or so months afterwards. I could barely move anywhere, felt barely conscious. Drank a lot, ate little. I would wake up at 4 pm and could barely drag myself on my desk to study. Torpor is a good way to describe my state at the time. I, almost obsessively, imagined all that was left unsaid between me and my friend, all that I wanted to discuss, all the memories we could have had, how they\u2019re gone and they didn\u2019t even realise they were gone, it must have felt like they just went to sleep. That made me afraid to go to sleep.\n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI love reality and love the beauty it brings; I think the world as it is has more depth than anything we could merely imagine. But I also hate how things are when they could be better. I see a bigger problem behind each small problem. It drives me nuts sometimes. I daydream a lot, especially when I\u2019m taking a long walk, and I am aware of where I am going, but it feels like I\u2019m in a borderspace between reality outside and reality inside my head. It\u2019s pretty fun.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nThink about what I want to study tomorrow (I have finals lol). Otherwise, go through some fictional scenarios that I may want to write or not. I think about some philosophical problems and sometimes as I \u201ctalk\u201d to myself in my head I get a great quote; I write it down. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt varies! I made the decision to leave my job to continue my studies before I even learned I was accepted, and it was pretty self-evident so I didn\u2019t have doubts. But I thought about whether I should end my friendship with a friend who lied to me about something really significant for months and months. Once I\u2019ve made it, I have doubts and am afraid of the consequences, but later when I see what\u2019s on the other side, I don\u2019t look back.\n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nEmotions add colour to life. They make life pretty to look at, but too much of it will saturate and leave you unable to see your way. So I think you should know when and at what level to enjoy them. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI never agree with others to appease them; if disagreeing outwardly would disrupt the environment or cause hurt, I refrain from saying anything too harsh. If I am pressed, I make a vague, \u201cmeh\u201d gesture if anything. \n\nIf I agree with someone, it\u2019s because I understand their reasoning. If I agree with someone who says the exact opposite as what the other person said, it\u2019s because I understand their reasoning. I can agree without committing, or trying to fool people into thinking that I wholeheartedly support them when I actually don\u2019t. I prefer to maintain neutrality, and if I truly do agree with someone, I don\u2019t shy from showing it. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI do not break rules unless absolutely necessary; I think nobody should. Rules \\*are\\* there for a reason, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t evaluate them, and often. If I\u2019m going to break a rule, it must be for the sake of something so important that I could not live with myself if I didn\u2019t.", "clean_guess": "INFJ", "llm_guess": " INFJ", "logprobs": []}

{"submission": "All jokes aside, I figured that I'd take a step into the pool of mbtitypeme because it sounds like fun and tbh I think I'm not doing too well with functions. I'm good at typing others, but myself? Ehhh, a bit shaky. As usual, answers depend on many things, but I'll try my best to be unbias.\n\nI know a fair amount of knowledge on mbti, so I'm not in the dark or anything. But all information is good information, especially if it's people I don't know who've met me for the first time. No bias an all that.\n\nAnyway, I'll just go down the line. I'm 18 years old so my functions may be a bit immature, I'm male, and I play guitar, love movies and TV, videogames of course, and I have a weird habit of wanting to help people who ask for it.\n\nI have inattentive ADHD and I'm an Enneagram 9, this makes typing me pretty annoying, as I can barely focus on one thing at a time. I grew up in a religious house, but it wasn't too religious as to where I casted it off. I'm still fairly religious, as I believe that as long as I believe, even if I die and God doesn't exist, I won't know, therefore, I'm perfectly fine. \n\nMy life was not very stable. My mother often moved around places, and my parents argued a lot. I ended up living with my grandparents and staying there after my mom went basically AWOL. I still talk to her, but I don't like it at all. As a child, I had a ton of energy and didn't understand social cues well at all. I just did what I found was fun and when I upset people, I myself felt deeply hurt my it, as I never wanted to hurt anyone, I just wanted to have fun. \n\nI spend a lot of time alone. With that being said, I greatly enjoy being with others as well. I enjoy it when I go out with friends to do basically anything as long as we're doing something new. Or even something that I don't instantly assume we'll do (I hate it when I go over to a friend's house and we have literally nothing to do besides play video games).\n\nI love playing the guitar and try to play it everyday when I don't have school or work to do. I can't keep it consistent though, my motivation is sadly all over the place. I have a very good talent for getting good at anything if I try hard enough, and I believe that anything is possible as long as I work hard. Actually working on it is something that I find extremely hard to do, and it upsets me when I think about playing the guitar, drawing, writing, etc and then remember I haven't done any of it in weeks or months.\n\nI don't often take up leadership roles, I prefer to do things myself. If I'm working on a group project, odds are I'll do most of it myself. I would prefer for me to work on something so I can edit it and fix it if I need to. I don't trust others to do it the way I want it done. That being said, I understand I can't do everything myself, and I'll assign people to work on certain aspects of a project, and if they don't, I'll be more forceful about it.\n\nI'm very artistic. As said prior, I write, draw, and play guitar. I love self discovery and that's the whole reason I'm in mbti related threads. Even if I'm not good at it, there's a sort of rush I get when writing what's in your brain down onto a sheet of paper. I'm very nervous when sharing it, though. In regards to writing, I feel that it is the easiest way to share yourself. I love writing about the moral dilemma of heroes and how they feel about their friends. The most interesting ones to me are the ones that do what they feel is right no matter what, even if what they feel is right is objectively the wrong choice, and once they realize that, their friends help them to fix their mistakes.\n\nI hate the past, it's filled with nothing but pain, I have very few good memories. The only good ones I can think of are watching movies in theaters with my dad or opening presents. I don't like the future that much, either. Something about it gives me anxiety, and I'm not sure what. A lot can happen in a few days, and it's hard to know what. It's easier to deal with something when you see it.\n\nWhen someone asks me for help, it's basically an instinct for me to try to. I am very good at helping others and try my hardest to make everyone feel happy. It gives me satisfaction knowing I could make someone's day. I even help people who I don't like sometimes if they genuinely feel that they need it. Alongside this, sometimes I tend to help people who are in grave danger. I've helped many people, including my own SO, who were ruined by others so greatly that they thought they couldn't be fixed. I don't know how I did it. All it takes is a little kindness, I guess. I don't know, I just hate seeing others hurt. \n\nLogical consistency is a hard question to answer. I feel that \"logic\" is extremely subjective, and I know that many people rely on it too heavily. Sometimes, there is no logic. Or, the logic is simpler than it seems. I've noticed that many people attempt to logically make sense of something that someone did emotionally, or in the heat of the moment. When they do, I bluntly reply \"It's because they were upset\" or something along those lines. They don't ask anymore questions after that. The answer seemed obvious to me. \n\nWhen I have a lot of work to do, I tend to tell myself that I'll do it on a specific day. I hate planning, so doing anything further than that gives me anxiety. I tell myself \"I'll work on this on Monday\" and then try to work on it as much as I can. If it's a big project, I'll give myself multiple days. I usually work near the end of the day because I have a hard time getting down to work. I rarely plan how my project will go if it's something new, or if it's a paper. But whenever I wing an essay, I always get a good grade. I know I can't wing everything, but I have a hard time not doing it. I always try my best, though.\n\nWhen making an important decision, I usually take time to think about it. I don't want to make the wrong decision, and I'm not often swayed if people try to hurry me up. If I \\*do\\* have a limited amount of time, I try to think of what would either cause me the least stress, or what would make the most sense. I understand that sacrifices need to be made, so if, let's say, it's the trolley problem, in the heat of the moment, I'd save whoever was closest to me. If there was someone that wasn't close to me, I would do what I can to save everyone. I don't have close attachments to those people, so therefore it would be easier for me. That sounds really messed up, sorry.\n\nI usually cannot process my emotions unless I am given ample time to. Music helps a ton. Also, due to me repressing a lot of traumatic experiences, I find myself needing to talk to someone to understand that what I have gone through is not normal, and it is okay for me to be upset at them, or for me to understand that they are bad, and that my emotions are valid. These are the kind of things I tell others as well.\n\nAnd lastly, the only time I don't break the rules when I think they're stupid is if they affect my grade in school. Any other time, I have no issues breaking rules if I find them to be bad. \n\nAnd that's it! I hope they were descriptive enough. It's pretty late and I spent a long time typing this, so any opinion helps. Thank you to those who take the time to actually read this.

{"submission": "I think I have come to a point where I know too much about MBTI in order to type myself. I tend to see many aspects of myself, which make it difficult to box myself into the different cognitive functions.\n\nI also have to add that I tend to want to be of a specific type (ENTP), and the fact that I want to be that type means Im probably not that type.  Im going to try to be honest and thorough in my approach.\n\nGeneral qualities about me:\n\n\\-I tend to be socially awkward and have social anxiety for the most part, I want approval but cant seem to be myself around others. In my childhood I tend to have conflicts with groups (especially girls). I used to be a very big kid and I think I intimidated girls more. This issue is pretty big in my life, and I try to move into solving it (therapy, exposure, philosophy).\n\n\\-On the other hand I deeply want to be accepted by others. I see people as a double edged sword, if they like you and you connect, its awesome. But if youre not liked, and they gang up on you, it can be pretty lonely.\n\n\\-Im extremely pulled into Philosophy, especially Stoicism. I believe in Stoic virtues (Courage, Temperance, Justice and Wisdom) make me a better and more valuable person. I believe a virtuous society is way stronger than an hedonistic society to which we are moving into. Im also slowly turning back into Catholicism. My appeal for religion is individual,  yet I think organized religion is important when meeting similar people and with your relationship to God. \n\n\\-Sports always came easy to me, I really enjoyed being good at it and improving my skills. I go to the gym often and used to play Rugby before I injured myself (I feel sports is a source of wellbeing when Im having hard times).  I also tend to love music and have an innate feeling for aesthetics. Yet I hate people that focus too much on easthetics (This is one of those things in life where youre good at it, but dont value it)\n\n\\- I really like smart and eloquent people. I think I wish to be that way, but sometimes I cant creatively argument myself in a debate. I have a pretty good general knowledge base, but Im pretty bad at quickly grasping complex ideas sometimes. Yet I really like thinking abou these complex issues and come to conclusions by myself.\n\n\\-During conversations, I hate small talk. I would much rather speak about broad topics such as the state of the world, geopolitics, psychology or science. I really enjoy talking about different unrelated things, yet mostly when they are impersonal (not about myself). \n\n\\-I have a big neccesity about understanding myself, why I think the way I think, feel the way I feel. I feel I do this in order to have a firm grasp about myself or reality itself. That being said, I have a hard time expressing my feelings in a personal way. I also have a hard time being in the present moment.\n\n\\- People have described me as reserved, mysterious, shy, serious (I guess much of this is my SA). I think I was more extrovert in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings to consider:\n\n\\-I hate social anxiety, I dont know how much that impacts my behavior or outlook on life.\n\n\\-I studied business but I changed my career into Data Analytics.\n\n\\-I value these cognitive functions (Ne, Ti, Ni) and dont like these functions (Se, Fi, Si). --> Just in case I might be skewing myself in my description.\n\n\\-When doing the MBTI test I almost always got ISFP or ISTP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot for the help.

This leads to extensive research, introspection, and scenario planning, driving my self-improvement and pursuit of dreams.\n3. **Pursuit of Inner Peace and Creativity**: I seek a life of peace, uniqueness, and meaningful connections. Storytelling and imaginative journeys have been a part of me since childhood, though concrete steps towards these goals can be elusive.\n4. **Discomfort with Conflict and Sensory Sensitivity**: I struggle with emotionally intense situations, loud noises, and complex social settings, partly due to Asperger's.

{"submission": "I think you can define two personas that I have: the loyalist and the hedonist.\n\nWhen I am actually in a serious mood and I need to get down to business, I am in the loyalist mode. In this mode, I am diligent, calculated, vigilant, possibly anxious and paranoid, but also very loyal and reliable to those that I see as worthy of my alliance. This makes me a good team player at work, and a good family member or friend after work. I use a mixture of logical skills and people skills to navigate most problems, finding the best solution that nullifies most threats to people I care about. I can be very adaptable, improvising solutions and shifting myself to fit any roles that other people around me implicitly need or crave. Place me near a near inconsolable friend and I will immediately turn into a patient ear and reliable shoulder to lean on. Place me in a team full of specialized, talented, but disorganized members and I can take any tasks that nobody else can nor want to do AND craft a procedure for our group so that all our work is now easier to do. I can also come across rather introverted in this mode even if I actually love talking to people. The main reason is more so that 1) my meticulousness makes me anxious about speaking before I have all the facts, and 2) I can be overly pragmatic in this mode, where unless the conversation is serving some purpose like solving a problem or calming someone down, I won't want to have any part of it. No small talk, no idle chats about idols as if they matter. Just straight to business. I think this mode, more than the other, can sometimes feel like I am following a script. I follow social scripts to properly finesse interpersonal situations, and I follow logical rules and procedures like scientific method and programming design patterns in order to solve tech issues.\n\nWhen I don't have to be serious, I instead shift into a sort of hedonist mode. I try new food, I buy nice clothes (though rarely super expensive ones, I'm practical) I go join or host parties to have fun with others. I can come across humorous, knowledgable (i can sometimes be that guy at the party acting as a know it all), well connected, and surprisingly considerate as I want everyone to have a good time. I can occasionally over indulge, but I know to rein myself back immediately afterwards. Another thing that I would associate with this side would be a slight tendency to be a gambler. Not just in the classic casino sort of way, but also in the sense of someone who likes to charge into opportunities and see what happens rather than carefully plan and calculate. This side also includes my occasional desire to go on treasure hunts, both in the sense of geocaching and trying to find hidden gems tucked away in my city that I can recommend to others. I like being able to explore and physically go to new places.\n\nWhat's really amusing to me is when people are too used to one of my modes and get a peek of the other side, they get very surprised. People who know my hedonist side better can be shocked that I am surprisingly responsible and mature; people who are accustomed to my loyalist side can be shocked that I am surprisingly reckless.\n\nMy mother has noted that 1) I am very external, (fair point, notice how my motivators, close contacts and pleasure, are all external motivators) but also that 2) I can be somewhat self absorbed at times. To be fair, this usually happens because I don't know where to go next and what to value, I can end up brooding and feeling insecure about how shallow I am. I am like a swiss army knife, versatile and sleek, but containing no inherent goal of my own other than to help whoever is \"using\" me. Not that I am a doormat, more so that I rarely want anything, so I need to borrow goals and values from other people.\n\nMy friend pointed out that I often \"debug\" my own feelings and personal problems as if I am still doing coding and everything I feel has got to make sense.\n\nI realized the other day that I do things literally either for hedonism or connection. If something is not immediately pleasurable, then it better allow me to connect better with other people around me. I am surrounded by a lot of professionals in tech, finance, and design, so I can sometimes be very sensitive to those topics. I just think being able to discuss a topic with someone else both helps me feel more reassured that my understanding of the topic is correct, and is a fun bonding moment.\n\nEven though I alluded to trying to be meticulous when in my loyalist mode, and I am always doing my best to be observant, I don't actually care about quality on my own. It's more so an insecurity and fear of not providing as good of a service or experience as I should be able to for another person. As long as there is nobody important involved, I can be very lax in everything except for cleanliness and maybe appearance sometimes.", "clean_guess": "ESFP", "llm_guess": " ESFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": " As a female When I was younger in elementary school I always founded myself \"mimicking\" people, and their morals, interests, and I never finded myself really, no friends or anything, and sometimes I still do it but I matured myself enough, overtime, \nI never was taught the morals I needed to be taught or what's \"social appropriate\"\n\nIn first grade I had my first friend, her name was D, but then she moved\nEverything with her was good until\nIn 3rd grade she moved..\n\n3rd grade:\n\nGirl/her friends: have you heard of ______ etc,\n\nMe: maybe I should make an account too, maybe we could be friends\n\nIn 4th grade:\n\nGirl: I wanna go to gymnastics, etc etc,\n\nMe as a kid thinking: maybe I should go to, because she's going, maybe I'll like it? And maybe I should be a gymnast?\n\n5th grade: \n\nGirl: I like orchestra, I also wanna play the violin\n\nMe: maybe I should go to because she likes it too, maybe I will like it too?\nBut do I wanna go because she is going? \n\nOvertime I founded myself having these traits, I never founded myself exactly, all I was doing was just mimicking People's morals, behavior, I never knew what's appropriate or not... Or what's good, I never was taught like that, \nMost of the time, everytime in the classroom I always founded myself becoming an \"Entertainer\" for the classroom, doing stuff that approves validation, laughs, or create a scene to \"look cool\"\n\nBecause everyone's influence is doing it,\nSo obviously, there's no reason for me to think it's appropriate or not to do it, because it's subjective, and because I never had any consequences, other than learning it from my own experience,\nBut I also founded myself hangingout with those black girls, and be like them... Makeup, edges, braids, I also found myself mimicking the person sayings to \"look cool\" I guess, and founded myself easily distracted and most likely to be dumb at math.\n\nBy the end of the 5th grade, of report cards everything changed for me,\nBecause of this girl: \n\nLet's call her M\n\nM: look I have A's, B's, Etc, \"My parents are going to be proud of me\"\nM always had good grades/ get rewarded but I envied too much of her, and others I never knew why...Im always in summer school, i always get Cs, ds, E's, and go there for every grade in elementary school, \nUntill then I felt like something sparked in me, \nOf course, \nTHATS IT\n Success... Accomplishment Is the thing...\nI felt like I was in a grip of my inferior function idk.. or was it ni nemesis?\n\nBy then that motivated me by 6th grade, \nI also questioned myself why I wanted success, Accomplishment\nDid I wanna do it for someone's approval,?\nDid I wanna look cool?\nWhat do I want in my path?\n\nSo then that spark me again, I realized I wanted accomplish things to see, how far I can get, and maybe realize how much potential I have in myself,\n by then 6,7,8 grade I had good grades A's, B's, some C's, I didn't get rewarded much into it, (honor roll) by then I wondered why?, sure I envied others accomplishments, \nbut then overtime 6,7,8 grade \n\nI learned that i should i have my patience,self decplen and not expect things of what \"I think I deserve\" after all that hard work, effort, but I was happy to learn things from the topic even if I didn't get rewarded, honor roll from it.\n\nI didn't like having vengeance, revenge, on people for that, I never yelled at anyone before, beat up someone fight, going off on someone, I kept suppressing it, I mean sure I thought of it, but mostly I supress as much I can, those times, I also realized, the time will come when it comes, if only I do something about it.\n\nBy then\n I didn't care about anyone else's approval anymore, not even my mom's because she was in habit with being with men and stuff.\n\ninstead I thought of going independent to find myself, maybe accomplish things on my own, and see how far the journey can get, \n\nOvertime 7-8 grade I founded myself, having my critical thinking developed from my experiences, and school related topics, wisdom, stronger I Felt like I was an intj... Idk that feeling..\nI founded myself an intellectually, smart, and become worried about the path I will take that will lead to horrible tragic future events.\n\nIn 2021, I founded mbti, I was curious what it was about, I tried researching every mbti type, congintive functions, of what I think I am, I mean I got curious from it, so obviously, \nI got mistyped as an intj... Based on those images of (introvert, extrovert, intuitive, sensor, y'know those type me things) Which um I thought I was, one but now I think of it ...\n\nI also set myself a goal saying, \"if I find my mbti type, and learn certain aspects of it, what I think will be useful for the future, psychology, then i will quit mbti\"\n(I thought learning things from mbti for the journey, of my accomplishment, success)\n\nI founded myself Binge watching out of curiosity, every lecture cs Joseph made for the 16 personalities, I also founded him Biased, arrogant, I didnt Believe much of what he said, he did said some points I agree with, and then I stopped watching him, I tried EVERY combination of what mbti type I think I am, didn't work out for me, and binge watching other mbti videos, sites, tests for the last 2 years, including Reddit, and then I made my conclusions of things of my thinking and that's how I came here...\n\nAnd also I know nature/nurture of things including mbti, isn't always the same thing, I just got curious of mbti because of the journey of it, and for to learn some aspects of it.\nAnd I never knew mbti was originally for older folks out there... Sorry-\nBut I don't wanna use it to type others, other than finding having curiosity finding my own path, person,  but I realized I learned so much learning mbti.\n\nNow that I think of it, I think I could be an entp\nOthers mistype me as an intp, because I don't fit entp trope stereotype or something like that, others say I'm an infp which I don't think it fits me...

{"submission": "I've taken the actual Myers-Briggs test twice for school, and both times I got different results (ENFP first and INFP second). I never fully felt like related to the stereotypes, and sort of brushed it off because I was only a teenager when I took the tests. Now that I've started researching the different types more, I honestly feel like I relate to all of them for one reason or another. I will narrow it down to one type and think I'm definitely that one and then hear about another one and feel confused again. So anyway, I thought it might be a good idea to fill out the questionnaire and see what you all think. I hope this isn't too long!\n\n\\- How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n24f. I've been told that I am laidback, friendly, funny, and maybe sarcastic at times.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI believe I have undiagnosed ADHD, and have been told by my doctor that I have anxiety and depression. \n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI had a loosely Christian upbringing, but religion was never forced on me. I never really bought into what my church was telling me, though I went along with it as a kid just because I felt like I had to. I didn't and still don't have anything against religion, I just never felt like it was for me, even from a very young age. I enjoyed the social atmosphere of school a lot more than church, mostly because it felt more \"genuine\" I guess? \n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI currently work customer service. I hate it. There are times when I can connect with someone and I may think they are a nice person, but I hate the entire atmosphere around customer service jobs.  The idea that I am just serving people and deserve to be treated as less than them irritates me. It's not that I don't like people or don't want to help them, the power dynamic is just whack. I also don't like having to pretend to be happy all the time just to make the customer feel good. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI look forward to spending time alone, and I think I would feel a sense of freedom to know that I had the whole weekend to myself. However, depending on the circumstances I may start to get bored or feel like I'm missing out on something going on. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI love to be outside, whether I'm just going for a walk or playing some kind of sport. I didn't play organized sports much as a kid, but this wasn't because I didn't enjoy them (I'm tall so I always felt like people WANTED me to play sports, and I think that made me not want to do them). I have a garden that I grow vegetables and flowers in every year to varying degrees of success lol. I also really love drawing, painting, woodburning, and various other artistic things. I play a few instruments, though not well. I also love listening to music and playing video games. I can't really focus on books, but I try to read. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm a pretty curious person, mostly about what is going on in the world around me. For example, if I see something odd when walking around my neighborhood I might investigate it or at least wonder what the circumstances surrounding it were. Occasionally I have more conceptual ideas. I may think up stories or movie scenes, or think of something that I want to research.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI don't think I would seek out a leadership position, but I think I may be okay at it. I would not be an authoritarian leader by any means, and I would always try to be someone that the people I'm leading respect. Telling people what to do or being commanding would not be my style. I may struggle with some of the organization aspects of leadership, like making schedules, etc.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI try to use the past to learn and be better in the present. I can be a little bit nostalgic sometimes, but I try not to get bogged down by things I can't go back to. I honestly don't tend to think that far ahead into the future, but I do have anxiety so I have a vague feeling of fear surrounding certain aspects of the future. Things like climate change loom in the back of my mind, though I wouldn't say I'm actively worried about them. I tend to think that if I do my best to make good decisions now, the future will kind of fall into place. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI am usually willing to help if I realistically can and I'm not too bogged down by my own stuff. For example, if a friend were to ask for a ride somewhere, as long as it wasn't insanely far away and I don't have something else that I'm already doing, I would probably give them the ride. In the past, I have helped people maybe too much, often times feeling frustrated with them because my own needs got pushed aside. I have been trying to set more boundaries around this lately.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nNot necessarily. There are some things in life that can't be logically understood and I think I'm pretty comfortable with that fact. It adds a little excitement and interest to life.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIt frustrates me a little when something is wildly inefficient, especially if it's something that keeps me from doing my job as best as I can. But I wouldn't say I value productivity for the sake of productivity at all. In my opinion, someone should be productive because it gives them a sense of purpose, not just for the sake of producing more. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI always struggled with traditional style classes where you go to a lecture, take notes, then take a test on those notes. I also struggled when classes assigned a lot of homework because once I'm outside of school my mind has totally shifted gears. As a kid I loved music class and gym class (we usually had both in the same day).  In college I liked classes where we got to get out of the class room, and the work wasn't so intense that I couldn't socialize with my classmates.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI am afraid of ending up completely alone or somehow losing everyone/everything that I love. I know that realistically this isn't likely to happen, so maybe it's my anxiety speaking. Something that I hate is when people complain about the way things are \"these days\" without actually look at the reasons behind why they are that way and recognizing how we can work towards making things better. \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI occasionally daydream, but I am usually aware of my surroundings and I'm usually daydreaming about something that could actually happen (like getting my own house, spending time with friends, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI think that rules should be seen as loose guidelines to achieve a certain goal. They can be useful at times , but sometimes they need to be broken if a certain situation calls for something different. The rules should absolutely be put in question if they are harming someone in some way. ", "clean_guess": "INFP", "llm_guess": " INFP", "logprobs": []}
{"submission": "I once heard of MBTI after some guy started talking to it, and thinking \"hm where would I get that?\" And the very first mistake I did... was going to 16personalities. ISTP. They say it's unreliable as hell, so I tried other tests. Still identified as ISTP. Now skimming thru cognitive functions, that's where I'm stuck because there's a LOT of varying versions of this function's meaning. Although I do relate to Ni. The rest... I don't really know.\n\nNow I dunno if including my recounts of my thinking would help anything (aside from the attached result from the test I took, which is Mistype Investigator), but here we go:\n\n1. Everytime I deal stuff in computers, say upgrading this particular component, I would literally ask myself if this upgrade will work on my motherboard. So I immediately bring up Google and scavenge every PDF I can find in hoping I would get a reference manual. However, in case of doubt, I would ask from my friends if this upgrade can totally work, even with the data provided (e.g. \"So that 4th gen Pentium has 2 dual memory channel... assuming one channel is 2 slots then it's safe to assume I can put 4 sticks of RAM, right? Now I just need a friend to verify that\" or \"hmm should be fine mixing up LPDDR3 with DDR3 sticks, yeah?\")\n\n2. When it comes to learning stuff... I either had to self-learn, or direct experience thru IRL. Can go both for me, I remember where I had to learn using a video editor without any guidance, just fooling around with the tools, what works and what not, etc.\n\n3. Lastly, people. Ehh... I'm not that good in terms of people. 99.9% of the time I never talk my interests and hobbies because no one ever give a F that I do this, unless I'm with close friends. Also a loner, but not afraid to talk, just that I would rather have someone initiate a conversation than starting it by myself.\n\nSoooo there you have it.
