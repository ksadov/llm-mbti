{"submission": "The most consistent thing I've heard about myself all life is that I'm stubborn and impulsive. I often act on my whims without thinking about consequences. I've done and said many things that I regret. I think about future to some degree but it's more like set of imagines of things I would like to try or see or accomplish than concentrate plans.\nI have hard time making choices. Once I focus on one thing there's other that pop up in my head and I constantly ping pong between different ideas. I moved from town to town most times that any person I know. New month - new crush. I changed my college major few times, to be honest still don't know what I want/should do. Being trapped in something that I don't feel like doing or not good at got me scared. I really want to achieve something, be expert at what I do and being unbeaten, irreplaceable. I can lie about things just to impress someone, appear cooler than I'm. My life is never enough, always feel like there is something missing, like now I have amazing  supportive loving bf yet I can't wait to love be something greater than than like things we see in movies/books, I'm never satisfied with what I have. Sometimes I think that whole my life I'll be chasing some amazing thing that will never become reality. One of the worst things you can do to me is not remembering me. It's make me angry, not matter how many years passed by since the last time we saw each other or for how long we knew each other. When I walk into room I want my presence to be noticeable and make impression. I don't actually care if you think how nice or evil I'm as long as I blow you over I'm fine with it. \nMy bf once told me if we ever break up it would be leaving, he's the emotional one in our relationship and I could leave if I met someone or have other exiting opportunity and just feel like it. And it was one of the most insightful things someone ever told about me. What if the thing with some else could be more amazing than what you have? \nI want to be one of these people who feels like sunshine, who people ask for advice or turn to with any kind of problem. When I walk into room I want my presence to be noticeable and make impression. \nI can easily and immediately express emotion. When I mad at someone or feel sad I can immediately talk about it and explain why and how I feel. In relationships with people I have need to know everything about them, what they are thinking, feeling, they dreams, I feel bad when I find out they didn't share their problems with me. When I think about my loved ones I think about as as team and hope to go through things together. I can easily spot when someone is feeling down or happy. While I can be blunt at times and say what I think in hard way I care about well being of these around me. But I'm not someone who put others before myself and think people split on better and worse ones. When I'm out with friends but don't drink they often joke if I'm sure because I act bubbly, fun and outgoing - meeting with people energize me and put in good mood. Of course certain people can drag me down but definitely not all. \nI can be most objective person and have ability to see every side of conflict. Life isn't black and white and get mad when people think I'm arguing when I just explain different perspectives. I want to know what's going on behind scenes and people motives. I get very excited about things and like learning/trying it out but mostly likely to touch subject superficialy. \nSometimes I feel like I live more in my dreams than in reality but I also like doing things. New places or cuisines from different countries. I get easily fascinated by things/ideas/people. I tend to steal personality or look of people/characters I'm amazed by. \nLong detailed things bore me, even if it's just recipes. I make a lot of list and plans but mostly fail to finish anything I started or even go from planning to actually doing it.\nI need logical consistency in life. I need things to make sense to me whether it's my friend decision or end of mystery novel. I ended up not liking a lot of books because of their endings, like this person couldn't be murder I won't accept that solving. I still can't get over fact that Bridget Jones in last film choose Marc Darcy over second guy. They clearly don't got along that well so why don't try with someone who  is also great and have a great chemistry? And if her and Mark are soulmates like movie try to convince us they'll eventually find their way to each other.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/167d6he)", "clean_guess": "Gemini", "llm_guess": "Gemini", "logprobs": {"Gem": [{"token": "Gem", "logprob": -0.0053833993}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -5.3178835}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -7.7241335}, {"token": "A", "logprob": -11.3960085}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -11.6616335}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -13.5991335}, {"token": "Leo", "logprob": -13.9741335}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -14.2241335}, {"token": "G", "logprob": -14.5678835}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -15.3647585}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -16.021008}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -16.099133}, {"token": " Gemini", "logprob": -16.239758}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -17.364758}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -17.458508}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -18.052258}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -18.489758}, {"token": "Ast", "logprob": -19.052258}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -19.411633}, {"token": "gem", "logprob": -19.552258}], "ini": [{"token": "ini", "logprob": -8.89548e-06}, {"token": "ni", "logprob": -13.046884}, {"token": "init", "logprob": -13.570321}, {"token": "INI", "logprob": -13.984384}, {"token": "ani", "logprob": -14.281259}, {"token": "Ini", "logprob": -14.445321}, {"token": "imi", "logprob": -14.921884}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -15.359384}, {"token": "iny", "logprob": -15.406259}, {"token": "mini", "logprob": -15.445321}, {"token": "ino", "logprob": -15.484384}, {"token": "ina", "logprob": -15.492196}, {"token": " ini", "logprob": -15.656259}, {"token": "inn", "logprob": -15.843759}, {"token": "inish", "logprob": -16.34376}, {"token": "ine", "logprob": -16.554697}, {"token": "mi", "logprob": -16.56251}, {"token": "uni", "logprob": -16.945322}, {"token": ",", "logprob": -17.101572}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -17.12501}]}}

{"submission": "I technically went to elementary and middle school with her, although I will note that we never directly interacted (I did interact with her younger sister, though.) She is the middle child - she has an older sister, and a younger sister. I remember that when we were all rather young, her mother was a photographer (that her sister had actually been in a magazine) and her mother is a housewife - her family is not \u201cpoor\u201d in spite of it, by any means. They live comfortably, and may even be upper middle class. \n\nI will note that she is someone who definitely strikes me as being extroverted, even if you just glance through her social media (well, especially if you just glance through her social media.) Both of her accounts - her main account, and what I would *kind of* think of as being her spam account (has a silly username, \u201cyour hot friend\u201d) are public, and her main account has over 1,000 followers. There is a recent post on her \u201cspam\u201d account wherein she posts a caption saying that she had some beer (and actually posts a picture where she is holding a beer bottle, even though I think she\u2019s only a year older than me - nineteen) and notes that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like it\u201d (she posted in all caps \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d) She actually posts herself pouring it down the drain (in two of the pictures.) She also posted, beforehand, that she \u201cmade the family watch Tyler Childers music video\u201d with photographs of how her younger sibling and parents reacted. She has posted in a bikini a few different times on her main and \u201cspam\u201d accounts. She has a Tik Tok where she jokingly suggests that she thinks a certain character was \u201cgay\u201d for Gatsby. She has a conventionally attractive body - to me personally, she is more average than anything else overall - but does not seem to have ever had a boyfriend. I notice that she tends to look happy in photos, moreso than her siblings. She seems the most likely to me of her three siblings to have a child (it wouldn\u2019t shock me if none of them did, but she just seems like the one who would be most open to it.) \n\nShe has been friends again for a few years with a childhood friend of hers who she had a falling out with in middle school (the childhood friend said something to her when they were sitting together that seriously offended her. She did not want to make up with her until the girl in question apologized for her comment/seemed unwilling to, and seemed to really particularly remember whatever it was that the girl had said to her.)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/167w810)", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.0001820874}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -9.187682}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.937682}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -11.859557}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -11.968932}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -12.062682}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -12.734557}, {"token": "Text", "logprob": -12.984557}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -13.906432}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -14.172057}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -14.203307}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -14.312682}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -14.547057}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -14.609557}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -14.687682}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -14.781432}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -14.797057}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -14.984557}, {"token": "From", "logprob": -15.500182}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -15.531432}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -1.6286107e-05}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -11.406266}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -12.906266}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -13.406266}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -14.578141}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -15.062516}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -15.953141}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -15.984391}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -16.250017}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -16.937517}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -17.625017}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -17.640642}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -17.796892}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -19.359392}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -19.437517}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -19.765642}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -19.828142}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -20.343767}, {"token": " textual", "logprob": -20.421892}, {"token": " personality", "logprob": -20.609392}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.03592939}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -3.5984294}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -4.864054}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -8.582805}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -11.47343}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -12.59843}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -13.69218}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -14.395305}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -14.56718}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -14.801555}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -14.832805}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -14.97343}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -15.145305}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -15.41093}, {"token": " makes", "logprob": -16.129679}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -16.520304}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -16.660929}, {"token": " you", "logprob": -16.895304}, {"token": " doesnt", "logprob": -17.004679}, {"token": " in", "logprob": -17.020304}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -6.704273e-07}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -15.250001}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -15.625001}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -16.484375}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -17.15625}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -17.65625}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -17.703125}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -18.34375}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -18.632812}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -18.65625}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -18.96875}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -19.367188}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -19.40625}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -19.453125}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -19.859375}, {"token": "nt", "logprob": -20.117188}, {"token": " now", "logprob": -20.117188}, {"token": " to", "logprob": -20.390625}, {"token": "_not", "logprob": -20.414062}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -20.429688}]}}
{"submission": "Looking for MBTI typing help, but I would also enjoy insight on other typology theories (esp socionics bc its slightly similar)\n\nI would also appreciate anyone willing to go more in depth and give me more questions / a typing session\n\n\n\nManifestations of my cognitive functions\n\nTe\n1. See the importance, but not necessarily good at it\n2. It feels like an expectation I hardly fulfil\n3. Enjoy planning but rarely commit to big plans\n4. Prioritise efficiency in simpler tasks\n5. Ie: My first instinct is to try thinking out of the box to find what I think the best way of doing something is (some might say is Ne)\n6. I can differentiate Te and Fi, but it can be tough choosing between them due to (2) and also because I value Fi\n\nFi\n7. I\u2019m constantly thinking about what I like, value, and my stand on certain topics\n8. This makes me quite stubborn, self centred and emotional (I tend to have outbursts of emotions)\n9. I used to express controversial opinions a lot when common beliefs did not make sense to me, but I have learnt from the backlash and now try to express them less, though my thoughts haven\u2019t changed\n10. My morals are usually guided by reasoning, where I need to be able to explain why certain rules should be followed (a trend I see is that most of them end up at \u201crights\u201d, which is hard for me to explain further)\n11. Smaller traits like needing to have a special identity and being into typology-ish things all my life might be related to Fi\n\nFe\n12. I enjoy a harmonious group (ie. social practices that everyone follows) (but not in a situation where this turns possibly oppressive), even though I don\u2019t really go with the flow and neglect my own needs \n13. I kind of value the socionics definition of it. I love strong emotional atmospheres. Like listening to melancholic songs and feeling the emotional expressions of the instrumentals and vocals. \n13.5. When it comes to actually expressing emotions, I can\u2019t find the right words, I use metaphors and pictures.\n14. I often act oblivious to social tension because I do not know how to deal with them, though I can be easily influenced\n15. However, I have observed that I am not well aware about the people around me, I live in my own world\n16. I\u2019m gradually learning about the importance of Fe matters (its more about maturing ig)\n\nTi\n17. I\u2019m very into analysing and creating systems, hierarchies and categories\n18. I feel the need to rephrase everything I learn in a way I can understand better\n19. A dislike for ambiguity makes me search for an explanation / reason behind everything (eg. delving into philosophy and quantum physics even though I do not intend on any actual practical use, or just asking questions in my mind frequently and reflecting on observations)\n20. I cannot live with a jumble of unfiltered information, and I need things to make sense (It\u2019s hard to explain but basically everything needs to link together nicely and I need to make sure I have everything) (Love mind maps)\n21. Although I place value on Ti, it is hard for me to be completely logical, impersonal and objective in my decision making\n\n\nSe\n22. Most manifestations of this are related to the socionics definition of Si (ie. I enjoy indulging in comfort, I often choose whatever is physically easier)\n23. But it\u2019s not that I prioritise immediate physical comfort over everything else (ie. I try to be eco-friendly despite any slight inconveniences it may cause)\n24. I like thinking about the optimal space and state I would like to be in \n25. I can get quite sensitive to some sensory experiences (eg. it\u2019s hard to sleep unless its completely dark and silent, having to wash my feet whenever I step into the kitchen)\n26. It is quite difficult for me to be \u201cin the moment\u201d, as I space out a lot, though this may be due to factors such as the rise in social media scrolling\n\n\nNi\n27. Ni is like the \u201ccome and go\u201d function for me, where it\u2019s really like the \u201caha moment\u201d that appears every now and then, but I do not get to hung up on them because I need the security of accuracy (19)\n28. I do place interest and value on Ni stereotypes like symbolisms and dreams (I have a diary just for dreams), but of course, this isn\u2019t a good way to type \n\nNe\n29. I can often \u201cspit out ideas like a machine gun\u201d, except for in situations under extreme stress or when I really don\u2019t know anything about the given topic\n30. Again, stereotypes, but I\u2019ve been commonly described as creative all my life\n31. I do frequently bounce on different ideas and it is hard for me to commit to one unless I\u2019ve spent enough time with it and got attached (I get attached easily)\n32. I blame Ne on my constant oversharing and annoying explosions of messages sent to my friends\n33. Despite all that, I doubt that I have fully mastered this function, I\u2019m not good at constantly churning out new ideas on the spot for an extended time and keeping conversations going\n\n\nSi\n34. Probably quite strong, I want the security of proven sustainable methods when I get really stressed out and uncertain\n35. Points in (22)\n36. I\u2019m often scolded for being careless, I don\u2019t notice small details, except for when I\u2019m casually staring at a building analysing its structure etc\n37.

{"submission": "1) Happiness is overrated. I don't understand people's need for constant pursuit of happiness. Happiness is a fleeting and unstable thing. I want peace. I don't strive to have Happiness in life, I want peace. Things will never be happy 24/7. I will feel sadness, anger, stress, and love. There is a beauty to every emotion. Sadness allows you to feel every little thing. Anger fuels passion. Love drives us forward. Happiness let's us stay in the present. Stress helps us avoid mistakes and mishaps. Peace is accepting that there is a beautiful balance in all emotions. To say you only want Happiness is minimizing the beauty and need for the other emotions. I want peace in life and the ability to take things as they come, process them, and move through them. I haven't achieved complete peace but its my goal in life, not Happiness. \n\n2) Our values are stronger when they come from logic rather than emotions. Emotions are unstable and often inconsistent. If your values were based on emotion, they would be prone to shifting from feeling to feeling, never maintaining a set of core values. Logical values (personal or subjective values) are much stronger because there is a reason for them, a system we can rely on to justify our feelings, a way to maintain fairness in our values. For example, I find it odd that peoples view on eating meat to be an emotional value. When it's emotional, it's unfair. Which animals you deem \"ok\" to eat is essentially based on how cute you find them. That's not fair. I find the logic value should look at the emotional intelligence of an animal to determine the Morality of eating it. Or even have consistency and either think all animals are ok or none are. It makes no sense to me when people don't stop and break down the various aspects and logic behind their beliefs and values. \n\n3) I really don't know who I am. I see so many versions of who I could be. So many paths laid out for me in life. I can't choose. Who I am and how I act can shift from moment to moment.

{"submission": "Hi! I'd like some outside perspective on my type. I'm so deep into MBTI I can't judge myself accurately anymore and I keep getting really different results ...\n\n \n\n*Personal concepts*\n\n* **What is beauty? What is love?**\u00a0\n\nThat's a very complicated question. Beauty can be aesthetic beauty, as it can also be found in beautiful emotions, such as when something moves you or you feel at ease and in tune with the moment. Love is beautiful as well, I'd define it as a deep fondness of the thing that's loved. \n\n* **What are your most important values?**\u00a0\n\nImprovement, open mindedness, equality, honesty, duty, depth, passion\n\n* **Do you have any sort of spiritual/religious beliefs, and why do you hold (or don't) those beliefs in the first place?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI'm naturally skeptical, but as a good skeptic, I doubt both my earthly and my spiritual side. I have now come to accept both. \n\nI've believed in God for a short time in my childhood, because my friend at the time was a firm believer and she explained religion to me as if it was factual and that's what led me to believe her. Nonetheless, I could never feel a natural faith in religion and, eventually, I found arguments that explained every gap religion sought to explain, and I no longer had any reason to have that faith anyway.\n\n I must say, though, that I am a spiritual person. I am into astrology, energies and things of that sort, although I wouldn't stand by their veracity. Nonetheless, I can still feel connected to mysticism, it feels right, and some things have happened in my life that have made me at least question my beliefs. \n\nI believe now that your spiritual life doesn't have to rely on facts, the point is to let go of pure rationality. As humans, we have a spiritual side which it's interesting to explore, and the mere fact of the universe's existence is crazy enough for me to be open minded to anything being true.\n\n* **Opinion on war and militaries? What is power to you?**\u00a0\n\nI hate this question. Obviously war is not a good thing. Power to me is just a totally arbitrary system that we have created as humans to distribute opportunities and resources. I'm ok with leadership, and I find it necessary in a lot of cases, but being a leader shouldn't make you more important than the rest of the group. I'm always appalled when I think of how leaders would have no power if we just stopped listening to them, they're just as human as you and I, but they're up there because people obey them, and people obey them because half of the time their lives are at risk and the other half of time they benefit from that person being powerful. \n\nEvaluation & Behaviour\n\n* **What have people seen as your weaknesses? What do you dislike about yourself?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPeople have described me as weird, controlling, selfish, overly sensitive, distant, tactless, rude...\n\nI can see where these criticisms come from, but I believe I just have a really hard time with social cues, which makes me be perceived unfairly. I do admit I tend to overstep my boundaries and meddle in people's issues trying to fix them. I think my biggest flaw is actually being perfectionistic. I know this can sometimes be useful, but it turns against me making me unsatisfied with life, it's hard to maintain a stable self steem since I judge myself a lot for my mistakes, and I'm also really hard on others.\n\n* **What have people seen as your strengths? What do you like about yourself?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPeople have described me as intelligent, unique, good at expressing myself, helpful, genuine, mature, good\n\nI like my depth, my mind is a very interesting place to live in, I also like that I am reliable, passionate and driven. I am energetic, interesting and fun, and also very honest and spontaneous.\n\n* **Ever feel stuck in a rut? If yes, describe the causes and your reaction to it.**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot really, if I feel stuck I just try to move forward, but I'm always planning some kind of change in my life so it doesn't happen often. When it has happened, it might be because I'm feeling down and it's hard to get out of bed and do stuff, or I might be wondering when things will get better. I usually get out of the rut by finding a solution or making a decision, or just waiting because I know it won't be long til I'm back on my feet.\n\n**People & Interactions**\n\n* What qualities do you most like and dislike in other people? What types do you get along with?\u00a0\n\nI dislike fake people, I find it very hard to relate to socially conforming people, and I like interesting and intelligent people. I have a wide array of friends, my friends are usually people I admire for their personality and values. I get along with XNTP, IXFP, INFJ, ESTP. Ti and Fi users mostly...\n\n* **If you were to raise a child, what would be your main concerns, what measures would you take, and why?**\n\nMy main concern would be to raise them properly and not give them any trauma lol. I'd inform myself as best as I can to give them the best life possible, as it would make me very happy and fulfilled to give someone a chance to live a happy and fulfilling life.\n\n* **A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward and outward reaction?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI'm usually a bit taken aback, I might judge them internally at first, and then I'd try to see where they're coming from and I'd give my opinion. I don't usually let it show when I don't agree, as I don't want them to feel judged, but I let it be known (does that make sense?).\n\n* **How do you choose your friends and how do you behave around them?**\n\nMy friends are people whom I'm comfortable and I can be myself with, and I connect with them on a deeper level. I'm usually really genuine and barely hold anything back, I'm also quite insecure and worry what they think of me. I'm affectionate and honest.\n\n* **How do you behave around strangers?**\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nDepends on the context. If I'm at a party, I can act sociable, fun and I'm not as shy. I try to make things interesting and get to know new people. If I'm meeting people that are not my equals (teachers, older people...), I'm really reserved and cautious, I inhibit myself a lot, and I can't bring myself to be fake-nice even if it's good for the situation. On the other hand, if it's my equals but it's not a party situation, I'm also reserved, I'm not shy but I don't seek out interaction either unless something about them has caught my eye or they approach me first. \n\nExtra: Thank you if you've read all this, hope it wasn't too long. If it's worth something, I have spent an embarrassing amount of time on this post because I keep rewriting and selecting different questions and, oh well, I don't know what that says about me but it might be relevant lol. \n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "Aquarius", "llm_guess": "Aquarius", "logprobs": {"Aqu": [{"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -1.1430826}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -1.5337076}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -1.5805826}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -2.1899576}, {"token": "Vir", "logprob": -2.9399576}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -3.0337076}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -3.8305826}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -4.4712076}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -5.5024576}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -6.0180826}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.5180826}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -6.5649576}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -6.8930826}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -7.6743326}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.7837076}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -7.9399576}, {"token": "Leo", "logprob": -7.9712076}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -8.361833}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -8.455583}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -8.564958}], "arius": [{"token": "arius", "logprob": -6.1537958e-06}, {"token": "arium", "logprob": -12.187506}, {"token": "ar", "logprob": -14.750006}, {"token": "arious", "logprob": -15.015631}, {"token": "ari", "logprob": -15.890631}, {"token": "arian", "logprob": -16.343756}, {"token": "arus", "logprob": -17.10938}, {"token": "aris", "logprob": -17.593756}, {"token": "aries", "logprob": -17.67188}, {"token": "aria", "logprob": -18.187506}, {"token": "arias", "logprob": -18.26563}, {"token": "arians", "logprob": -18.656256}, {"token": "air", "logprob": -18.937506}, {"token": "amar", "logprob": -19.60938}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -19.95313}, {"token": "ario", "logprob": -20.92188}, {"token": "ac", "logprob": -21.17188}, {"token": "aurus", "logprob": -21.656256}, {"token": "ARI", "logprob": -21.781256}, {"token": "as", "logprob": -21.812506}]}}
{"submission": "Sorry if some of my answers are too long or not exactly what these questions mean I'm just really interested in them or I was getting scatterbrained and tried to come up with an answer.\n\nI have been thinking of creating a type me post for a month now and never got to it so here we go..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am a 13 year old girl. I'm pretty aware of things in my life if that helps, like for example I know whats right and wrong (not letting people take advantage of me, knowing the signs, etc? It makes sense to me but I can't really describe it) but I'm trying to figure out if its me being aware or just common sense since I can't find a good word for it.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNo\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don't have a job\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI don't know I can't really think of how I would feel I'd have to be in the situation to know exactly but I think I would just be relaxed, and kinda lonely? Maybe I would be refreshed if I were exhausted from the week/day before or I really wanted alone time.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI never really thought about it, I like sports maybe I only like the idea of them and I've never tried any sports. I would only play a sport if I felt comfortable playing it, I like to think that I'm just too lazy to do sports but really I'm just awkward atleast thats my description because when I think about sports Im worried I'll embarrass myself I wouldn't beat myself up about it though because I don't really care but I care yk? I would rather spend years practicing than go in with little practice. For some reason I feel that sports are embarrassing, not for other people but for me I cant really explain it well.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI don't think I'm really curious I don't spend my day thinking about what could be or how something can change. If I am thinking about something I would say its probably conceptual most of the time like if I see a picture about space or some video about it I'll be curious and start thinking, \"Well what if \\_\\_\\_?\" or \"Wow so many unknown things\"\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nCan't say, I would need to be in the situation to answer this\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to LOVE art, drawing was my favorite thing to do and I would spend hours every day and more during summer drawing, doing origami, or making pockets for my supplies in notebooks or just the pages with glue or tape, I would have just stacks on stacks of art and I think I had about 4 notebooks that I used to draw in. I really liked digital art too, my art wasnt and still isn't really good but I dont care much because It's something I enjoyed doing and I still get really happy and in the zone when I draw or do something creative like mess around with glue and craft.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI don't care much for either too much, maybe sometimes I'll compare/remember the past and future with what is in the present but I'm usually just in the present, I think that I am a more in the moment person because after events or hangouts etc I cant feel the way I felt in the moment so I really like to stay in the present more so I can feel it. I don't know exactly what you mean by how do you deal with them but I'll try to answer. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nDepends on what it is, If it's something I know how to do or I can do it then I would say yes. If I do decide to help them I don't really know why I would do it, I just do.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nNot really.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nImportant but not super important.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don't think I control others, but if I did it would probably be because of something personal? Or what I'm feeling, I don't know exactly how though.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI don't really have any hobbies now.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy learning style is visual I think (I took a test before answering this). Sorry I won't answer the other questions because I can't think\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'd say I am okay at strategizing. Sometimes I wing it and sometimes I improvise or sometimes I do both so I can't say much for this question.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nHonestly I don't really know. I just want to be rich to where I won't have to work or have a comfortable job, thats my goal.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy only fears are the dark and rollercoasters, rollercoasters just make me uncomfortable because its not really scary but you can just feel your stomach drop and the wind doesn't make it better, even if I close my eyes I know I am on it and I would think to myself about if it's just some internal issue but I'd rather not. The dark is just self explanatory (I think thats the right word) its the DARK, what's inside of it? I would rather be in a room with light where I can see EVERYTHING than be in a room where I can't see anything, I've thought about it and even if I were in the dark with headphones blasting and nothing to see to give me the illusion I am safe what if something were to grab me. And now I see this answer is getting way too long so I'll stop here.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI feel like I am just unable to daydream, I can have a good imagination but trying to visualize in my head about things (I think thats what daydreaming is? unless it can be me and my thoughts then I will say no I don't daydream often) and dreams doesn't work for me so I would say I am pretty attached to reality. I pay a lot of attention to whats around me, but not in a super spy threat detected way. I'm more observing, in my head, when I walk into a room i pay attention to whats in it. (people, whats on the walls?, how I feel, what I should do)\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nAnything, but I won't leave that as an answer because If someone gave me that answer I would be confused. If I were in that situation maybe I would think about how weird it is or something like, \"Wow is this what it's like to be literally lonely?\"\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI think I take pretty long, I'm trying to think of what I did in the past but I can't really think of what I did before. I don't usually change my mind when I make decisions unless I should or think its a better thing to do.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI think I process my emotions a little slow, I find that I'm kinda mood swingy like if I'm crying or feeling something I'll just be thinking about the situation that made me feel that way, I don't ask why but in my head if needed I comfort myself like, \"\\[my name\\] It's okay\"\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNo\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't break rules often or ever. I don't think authority should be challenged or that they know better, if they arent doing anything that harms then its whatever? I'm not a rule breaker, I'm too scared depending on what it is but if were at my lowest I feel I would be prone to just give up and say yolo. I'm like that kid who never played ding dong ditch with the rest of the group because I felt it was too scary not really scary but like \"what if\" scary (covering it up with \"I am just too lazy\" or \"I don't wanna\") and also I just felt I shouldn't.

{"submission": "(1) I view the world through a subjective, self-referential lens. I both consciously and unconsciously make judgements on right / wrong, good / bad based off of how I would like things to be. I have a hard time accepting the world for what it is, always wishing things would be better.\n\n(2) I have a soft heart and have fallen for sob stories. I believe what little I can to help those in need, I will do to the extent of my ability. I sympathize with others by seeing myself in others or if it\u2019s a cause that I can resonate with. I can get to the point where I feel sad when I realize I can\u2019t do enough to help others realize my ideals for them (especially when it happens to be their own), and I feel like I\u2019m constantly struggling against the way the world is, but on a deep level I still believe that kindness and goodness will ultimately be rewarded.\n\n(3) I am not confident in things requiring a high amount of attention to physical skills, reflexes, and meticulous attention to appearances. I am skeptical of, and tend to be wary of people that live physically / dangerously, or people that I feel put a lot of attention into the way they look or are overly concerned with coming off the \u201cright\u201d way.\n\n(4) It is difficult for me to truly admire or look up to anyone. I am aware that there\u2019s often a lot more than what they show the world, and that everyone ultimately walks their own path. There is only one me, no one else can be me.\n\n(5) I have a tendency to eat the same food, go to the same places, and listen to the same music over and over again. I tend to categorize knowledge, remember facts, and use what I feel are trusted sources so I can build up a reference catalogue of information. When I make a decision, I cast the net wide, gather as much info as I feel I need to, and pick what I feel is the best option. However, I tend to be a procrastinator and indecisive.\n\n(6) I am aware of and can understand feelings that don\u2019t come from the same basis as my own, but when I have to make a choice, it\u2019s hard for me to ignore my own feelings and go with what I feel is the most right to me. For example, a friend of mine had someone close to them die. I would give basic condolences, but if I felt that the person was not a good person in my view, I will also let the friend know how I really feel about him / her and feel it\u2019s my duty to let my friend have an accurate understanding of what really went on in their relationship.\n\n(7) It\u2019s difficult for me to travel somewhere and only see the \u201cup sides\u201d of the place, I tend to be naturally skeptical of say, certain travel YouTubers who are cheesy and extremely positive about everywhere they go, when I feel like I would have to get at least a decent understanding of the actual social and political issues so as to come to a more truthful understanding. This ties closely to an interest in history and sociology.\n\n(8) I don\u2019t have a keen understanding or grasp of aesthetics, a lot of things I approach from a very functional perspective. Don\u2019t count on me to decorate a beautiful home. I don\u2019t like being tied down by \u201cstuff\u201d, with the rare exception, because I value mobility and I feel like I can better engage my feelings, my thoughts, and have meaningful experiences when I don\u2019t have to focus a lot on the materialistic world. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m as in touch with hot / cold, physical sensations as some other people are.\n\n(9) When I feel anxious, I become more critical and combative, a bit more aggressive than usual. I find fault in everyone and everything, and I feel strongly driven by a desire to correct things and make them simpler, better, but I am also very lacking in organizational skills. I feel highly repressed and tied down by rules and expectations, because I feel like they assume guilt before innocence when they don\u2019t even know me on a personal level or my intentions. I guess you can say I have a problem with authority. The fastest way for me to lose respect for someone is when someone uses their position of power to step over me, instead of using their personal qualities to make them deserve my respect.\n\n(10) I am not entirely rejecting of tradition and convention, but I MUST interpret them and follow them in a way that suits ME and makes ME comfortable. External expectations and pressures, I don\u2019t thrive under them at all.\n\n(11) Through both life experiences and self-analysis, I believe that the right people will come to me. It\u2019s futile trying to fit in and gain the favor of a group that never intended to view me as an equal in the first place.\n\n(12) My way of informing is dumping it all, giving all the knowledge I feel the other person needs.\n\n(13) I am at my best when sharing ideas, rather than creating. I might not have much \u201ccreativity\u201d in the sensual / physical sense, I prefer to engage and hopefully influence with my feelings, my thoughts, my attitudes.", "clean_guess": "Pisces", "llm_guess": "Pisces", "logprobs": {"P": [{"token": "P", "logprob": -0.047637485}, {"token": "Vir", "logprob": -3.1413875}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -6.1726375}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -7.1570125}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -8.578888}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -9.469513}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -9.625763}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -9.813263}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -10.641388}, {"token": "Leo", "logprob": -11.328888}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -12.797638}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -12.922638}, {"token": "A", "logprob": -13.063263}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -13.922638}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -14.422638}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -14.625763}, {"token": " Pis", "logprob": -14.782013}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -15.578888}, {"token": ":", "logprob": -15.672638}, {"token": "Pieces", "logprob": -16.282013}], "is": [{"token": "is", "logprob": -7.89631e-07}, {"token": "isc", "logprob": -14.828126}, {"token": "ISC", "logprob": -15.015626}, {"token": "ices", "logprob": -16.25}, {"token": "isce", "logprob": -18.125}, {"token": "ics", "logprob": -19.796875}, {"token": "ies", "logprob": -21.796875}, {"token": "ises", "logprob": -22.125}, {"token": " Vir", "logprob": -22.953125}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -23.21875}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -23.359375}, {"token": " Pis", "logprob": -23.703125}, {"token": "IS", "logprob": -23.890625}, {"token": "f", "logprob": -24.046875}, {"token": "Vir", "logprob": -24.1875}, {"token": "ig", "logprob": -24.25}, {"token": "Is", "logprob": -24.3125}, {"token": "ise", "logprob": -24.4375}, {"token": ".", "logprob": -24.46875}, {"token": "\n\n", "logprob": -24.484375}], "ces": [{"token": "ces", "logprob": -6.704273e-07}, {"token": "cean", "logprob": -15.015626}, {"token": "cess", "logprob": -15.882813}, {"token": "ceans", "logprob": -17.476562}, {"token": "ec", "logprob": -17.671875}, {"token": "cest", "logprob": -18.0625}, {"token": "ices", "logprob": -18.125}, {"token": "ecs", "logprob": -18.265625}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -18.34375}, {"token": "ceso", "logprob": -18.34375}, {"token": "\u0441", "logprob": -18.578125}, {"token": "CES", "logprob": -18.953125}, {"token": "ca", "logprob": -18.976562}, {"token": "cc", "logprob": -19.429688}, {"token": "cec", "logprob": -19.46875}, {"token": "ce", "logprob": -19.640625}, {"token": " ces", "logprob": -19.648438}, {"token": "ac", "logprob": -19.765625}, {"token": "cea", "logprob": -19.953125}, {"token": " Ces", "logprob": -20.0625}]}}
{"submission": "I hope this post will gather some informed folks.   \n\n\nHello there. This is my first time posting on Reddit after several months of cultivating information about MBTI from some of you. I don't really like to resort to asking people even though I know it would help to understand MBTI typing. Of course, I know this sub would have a lot of people as \"not so\" informed as me, but I also read a few of you who have a very great grasp of what MBTI is. That alone, I think, would be worth a shot, given how exhausted I am reading some points I clearly do not understand.\n\nI really don't know how to start, so I would answer the guide questions the sub provided. May you continue reading, thanks!  \n\n\n**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am female and just turned 22 last month. I am quite interested in everything, except sitting down and doing the same thing. I was really interested in programming. I even started teaching myself, BUT I got tired after some time. It was one of my dreams to learn to program, but my focus is just so bad sometimes. One day I had it, next week I didn't. I wanted to have a routine, but I am bad at making it. But if someone would help me, and mentor me, that would be excellent because I am very good at learning things. I am also excellent at following directions. Although I would question it sometimes, I am very good at producing results. Maybe, I really just need some determination.\n\n**Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**\n\nI never had any medical condition that would greatly impact my mental stability. Though, I think I have to mention that I am anemic. This condition actually influenced my concentration as I would get tired easily. But, because I am currently taking iron supplements, the symptoms are not as strong as they were before. I am healthy, though not as active as I was before. \n\n**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy mother is very religious. She would not let me play outside unless I was done praying with her. This is not the type that would get me beaten up if I refused, but I did get intense stares so I never really had the chance to refuse. Clearly, I am just afraid to do it. Yet, I did remember getting scolded after fighting over a chalk with a neighbor while she was praying. That's where I got some little discipline. I would never do that again. That neighbor was so eager to steal my chalk, so I shouted. Ugh. In case you are confused, I used to draw to our walls. So, I needed that chalk. I also used the chalk to calculate basic math, you know, kindergarten math. I was four or five I think. However, my mother was so loving, she gave me colored pens. Now, the walls had permanent inks.\n\nI think it is important to say that even though my mother is religious, she would not force me to do every religious thing, but she would teach me some things. Notedly, religion was not the forceful part, it was the tutoring. I remember in the second grade (late), one mistake in any subject on my exam would be equivalent to one tiny pinch that would make me bend my body. You know classic motherly disciplinary action from being stupid. Well, at least that's what my mom always says. I was intensely (at least for me) tutored by her from the day I got to hold a pencil. I remember answering simple geometry questions during my first grade. Of course, I was not anywhere near a genius, so I would get pinched again. My mother had so high expectations and was very eager to show people that I should be on top. I was never let to play if I was not yet done with her exams (and perfected them). With these actions, I always miss to play with my neighbors. Well, they were not the best people I know, but they were the only people in my town. So in conclusion, I never had any solid friends. And if I made one from my town, I always ended up destroying it because I was not the kind of person who would conform to their expectations. AND THEY HAD SILLY EXPECTATIONS. I mean, they>! tried kissing!< in front of me. They asked if I would like to join, OF COURSE NOT. I was maybe 8 at that time. It was a nightmare. At that time, I felt that I was never in my group and was constantly asking if I was right for my age. Neither of them thought the same way as me and I was comfortable being with adults because they were often quiet or discussing things that I was interested in or gentler to me.\n\nTo add, I was also very competitive. I think my mother's actions really influenced me. In every competition, even simply playing children's games, I really like to win. I think that also created some cracks with my childhood friends. Well, they were not really friendly too, so I just really decided that they were not worth my time. So, I never really tried hard to understand them, even though I tried to please them sometimes.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI just graduated with microbiology in my diploma. The whole course experience was actually just dreadful. I mean, I never liked it in the first place. I was contemplating to shift during my second year because it was boring for me. BUT, the friends I already had were very kind, and thinking I would leave them would not be a very excellent decision. Because I never liked any course except computer engineering which was not available at my university, shifting would just give me a new environment and would not fulfill the satisfaction I was looking for. So even though the course was not really for me, I somehow enjoyed laboratory activities, especially discovering some things I never thought I would see under a microscope. It's fascinating, but still, I was not happy. Graduating with flying colors would not eventually equal how much I liked the course, it would just mean that I was afraid of failing because I would be extended. I needed to get out the FASTEST way possible. I was not on a consistent dean's list and this was the ultimate decision maker of my grades because the time that I was out of the list, I would pursue getting on the list just to keep track. I remember two perfect exams I just made because I was angry about the low GWA (for me) I had last semester. I was so angry at that time because I let myself be filled with sadness I thought I just created myself. So I perfected the exams and got a 4.0 on that subject. And it's just because I was ANGRY at myself. Then it disappeared and I went back again to a stressed student who needed some help with her priorities.\n\n**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nThat would be refreshing for me, even though I think a week would be too long to stay at home. I would spend the week on vacation. I love my friends, but the topics they would share would most likely be their interests that would not really suit me. I am fine listening to them, but it's finer to have a vacation for myself. I really like experiencing things alone as I would learn some social things. I am very awkward, but I'm fine with a stranger. I would think that my friends would judge me so I mostly prefer to go or experience things alone. A stranger would not have existing information about you, so you're free to try and manipulate the set of impressions you can present to them. Well, just being nice would be enough. I just don't like overthinking things, even though I do it almost every time.\n\n**What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage?**\n\nI do prefer outdoor sports and some indoors. I play basketball and archery. I also like strategic games. I don't like sit-down games though they look interesting to me. I like watching chess, I just don't have the guts to learn it by the book. More like, I like watching people think. I always try to predict things and associate them with social and behavioral cues, crossing out things and adding new information. This was easier for me. This was how I learned basketball and some of the chess moves and techniques when I was younger without watching a video or reading a book. However, I forgot most of them now, mostly because I have no one to play with. \n\n**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI think I am moderately curious. Well, if I would compare my curiosity to my younger brother, I would fall low because who else would destroy a fully working machine just to see what's inside and use the important mechanical parts to build a boat?? Nah, not me. And yes, I would have many ideas and I would not execute them. And I do think many people had that too. Most of my ideas are conceptual and abstract, and I don't remember several of them now. May be if I come across related things or when I'm working on something. But I did remember one thing, mostly observed by my peers and I never had any experience as I would like to have. An example: \"When you have a crush on someone, you would likely appreciate the things that you wanted to have that you found in them. It's not just about liking them, it's about admiring the things you wish you had that is likely to be present in someone. That is why sometimes you mirror your crush's appearance and match them instead of actually talking to them.\" This statement usually describes a *preliminary admiration*, if that's even a term. Another is \"WE can be conditioned to something powerful. That is why I believe that a great environment creates geniuses in their field.\" This statement actually explains why the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer. And for the poor to get rich takes very few coincidences that would make them realize that they can. They are not getting a good environment and usually, people surrounding them would just do the same. That is why education can be an important factor for change (education in any form, even not going to school). \n\n**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI am not the kind of person that would volunteer as a leader. I would want some of the members to choose their own. If I would be chosen, I don't really bother. I became a leader a lot of times during my younger years and some currently, and I really like to set up a meeting where we would brainstorm on the suggestions we have and pick one of the most voted and another one for an extra in case the first choice would not work. And I also like to make them choose what part they want to work for. If they would not present themselves, I would plan some areas (equally) to which the whole project would contain and select people according to their talents (if I know some of them) or select at random if we're complete strangers to assign the parts. That would be time-bounded, including time for necessary corrections if there is. THESE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN OUTSIDE MY FRIENDS (CIRCLE). My friends are really procrastinators and it is always difficult for me to make them understand that I need a specific amount of time to polish the projects we have to work on and submitting their part during the day of the deadline would be my nightmare. I mean, I procrastinate too, but they are just GOD-TIER. My other friend doesn't actually care about passing late, so I often help her with some parts of the assignment. She was somehow depressed because of certain pressures in her life. We felt the same thing (as I did during college), but I just had more control over my decisions. She was breaking. So I often get stuck stretching my patience even though I am really about to burst. Well, that's a friend, so I have to respect her flaws and be there for her no matter what. But I would be lying if I said I would like to experience that again. \n\n**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nIn my normal self, yes. I like my hands. I love to write. I also do archery so I need to be fully aware of my arms. I am coordinated, I think. I also have good reflexes. I think my body's well. :) I also learn a lot with my body just by physically experiencing things and I usually do DIY because I don't really have enough money, just like I made my archery target board.\n\n**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI was not as artistic as my mother. I am not also as artistic as my friends but I do like art museums. I enjoy looking at them and predicting what they may mean. I really never met anyone in my life who has the same view of the world as me, at least in real life though. I am not also very talkative online so I would have many friends. My friends in real life are the only ones I talk to online, too. I have some online friends before but some are older than me and the conversation never really worked. They got really busy with their work irl and quit social media. So sad.\n\nI think I express my thoughts in writing. In high school, I often write poems. I also write letters to my friends just because I express myself truly and deeply through words.\n\n**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI remember the past, but I seldom dwell with them. Most of the time, they are traps that would impact your potential in the present. Well, of course, I still remember things, but I don't like it. I wonder more in the future. \"Where could I be in 10 years\" \"Am I going to be rich?\" Such childish nonsense, but I still do to escape in reality some of the time. I also believe that living in the present will determine the future. So, I do every time I'm in my normal self. Maybe this would be the cause why I survived college even though I don't like the degree itself.\n\n**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nYes, I would grant it. Sometimes I am busy, but I still give time to my friends if they need someone. Even though I always observe that I am not receiving the same thing back. I just wanted to be kind, for I know the world needs that. And they're my friends, I always want the best for them.\n\n**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nNeed, yes, but I'm not always using it. I am sometimes impulsive and I hate that part of me. But even though that exists, impulsiveness created some 'fun' in my life. I was a rule follower during my childhood and it's fun to take some risks sometimes. But I am mostly logical throughout my life and check my existing values every time I am getting a difficult moral situation. I also would like to mention my ability to check logical fallacies. I am good at detecting those things which would really help me judge people's behaviors that are not just making sense. This comes like a superpower in some situations, where I can correctly guess that someone's pretending or lying even if we just first met. The statements they are just saying would not make sense. I don't know, other people (friends, family) do not go into this detail when they first meet with somebody.\n\n**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nVery, especially during schoolwork or group work. The thing is, I noticed that many of my classmates actually do not respect the concept of time. And when there would be a group meeting, most of them would be talking about other things and not about the work that must be done. I mean, I usually procrastinate myself, but that's just because I have a good knowledge of my abilities and some of the work may be finished within hours before the deadline, especially essays that I could just sit for 2 hours maximum. The thing with group projects is that they would be huge and have plenty of activities that the group should divide among the members. And I have very little patience with those people who would actually choose to do other things than what is planned. My friends are often like that, and I don't like it. I am not a meticulous person, but I can be if needed. I am not the most productive of the group, but I can produce results. Some just can't, and really, I hate it. I don't know, it's just one of my pet peeves. I mean, it's okay to deliver imperfect work, just tell me what part are you having difficulty with or why you decided to delay things.  I always give consideration. Just, you know when someone's just throwing their part and then they just let you finish it. \n\n**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don't like to control others just because I know it is not ethical, at least on my set values. But I admit, I have the tendency to do so. There were many instances, several of them were from my younger years. Those were BAD, because I was a control freak and I never liked anyone that's opposing me. Now, there are still remnants of it, especially the patience I have for somebody, but I have undergone some character development. I learned to be humble and actually treat people as people. Coming from me, this is a very huge jump. I think I learned some of these things because of my friends, the same friends I mentioned earlier. Those people have HIGH EQs, at least compared to me. That is why I still remain friends with them because they accept me for who I am, even though I am sometimes a pain. Well, I have the same sentiments as them, too :).\n\n **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\n1. Writing - I write to keep my mental health stable. I also don't like to express all my true feelings to my friends, so I write. \n2. Basketball/Archery - This makes me think that I'm really worthy of an opponent, even though I am not the best at these events. I pursue them because they are entertaining and would usually serve as my escape route from studying pressures and some personal problems.\n3. Jigsaw puzzles (I just remembered)- The only hobby that keeps me sitting (with some stretches) for 5-7 hours straight. You know what, I reckon, maybe I can learn chess? Well, it's just as entertaining as it looks! \n4. Watching movies - I like watching romantic movies when I'm stressed, horror movies when I am feeling happy, action movies when I have free time, and sad movies so that I can feel that I have a reason to cry several times a year.\n\nI'm sure I still have more, I just don't remember as of the moment.\n\n**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI learn best when I'm experiencing it myself. Often in sports, I just don't rely on the instructions, I have to practice it myself, though I admit knowledge does come from reading first (principles). I often struggle with PowerPoint presentation that just contains texts of their own so I often record the class or write down notes the way my teacher explain things and what conclusions I can draw from their statements. I think this was how I survived college. \n\nI dislike memorization for I don't really learn much from it. I like concept reading where I can answer and analyze many situations relevant to the concept. I also use logic to answer them, that's how scientific essays usually work in exams. \n\n**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI don't usually intensely strategize except when I need to manage my time. Because I didn't have an organization that I would lead in college, I was usually free and was able to manage projects without thorough planning. So my plans would usually just live in my head and the default process of tasks is that I would complete the easiest ones and focus on bigger parts later. Even though this would appear slightly spontaneous, I usually don't like improvising. Especially if the time was given before completing a project. Even though I usually don't have thorough plans, I can maintain in achieving a particular goal that I can work on until it's complete.\n\n**What's important to you and why?**\n\nMy family, close friends, and books even though I'm not a bookworm. It's not a hobby, but whenever I'm tired or restless, opening a good book is really like drinking a delicious tea in the morning. \n\nFamily, friends, they're the ones that supported me and were there for me since the beginning. Without them, I think I would not appreciate the world and the happiness it can offer.\n\n**What are your aspirations?**\n\nI really wanted to be a person who could deliver her duty to someone and would make them happy or satisfied. That's why, instead of taking and re-enrolling myself in computer engineering, I wanted to be a doctor. At the current age, I can learn programming if I want to, given the online resources that are accessible, even though I know it would be harder than enrolling myself again. I also wanted to give back to the community and just help other people by performing my best in my job. I want to directly affect them, just like in healthcare. Medicine just fascinates me and being able to actually study for something that I love and that directly affects people would be enough routine in my life. It also involves research which is something I liked when I was in college, though the process going through is not really that likeable. But the feeling after completing it is just a chef's kiss, especially if you see the hard work you did paid off.\n\n**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI am not usually scared of anything, except big spiders and the ocean itself. I even made a vow to myself that I would not travel on a ship. I panic when I cannot touch the sand with my foot. I even panic seeing rocks under me, so yes.\n\nI am uncomfortable being ignored (with friends; I'm numb with my family), when people cut me off when I'm talking, jogging with normal people in the morning (I usually like to be with someone), some intense criticism (from friends and family: would really hurt me), and performing drama (I hate this). These things would make me uncomfortable because they either hurt me or just make me think little of myself. Strangers don't usually affect me as much as the people who I'm close with.\n\n**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nYou will know that I'm in my nice zone if I am considerate, understanding, smiling with no reason (maybe I'm not just aware), and just talkative which is so not me in my normal days. I am so nice which I don't even understand. Also, I can just be sitting reading all day. When I'm focused, I am usually like that. I also don't mind the noise in my environment, I'm just practically calm. I also do not overthink things and let everything go with the flow. \n\n**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI would be angry at all times and be sarcastic to all the people I talk with. I would be honest with what I think and just basically *turn off* my emotions. I also become ruthless, especially when I think someone is not giving me the things that I deserve. I also become a perfectionist and overthink things a lot. I shout at people when they are annoying me and I would hate anything that's unclean and say every little thing I noticed that would not be up to my standard. I would criticize a lot of things and why they exist (not people). I would also become annoyed with everyone not in particular and would act like a smartass to anyone and in my head call them idiots. No kidding, in my lows, I act like a queen (that's angry all the time), even though I am not. And this is contrary to my lowest. \n\nAt my lowest, I would isolate myself for days without contact. I even would deactivate my social media accounts. I just don't feel like talking to anyone. And after days, I would be okay and back to normal. That's where I would share some of my problems (not deep reasons) with my friends and what I felt. You would not appreciate confronting me before I isolate because I would be angry at you for invading my privacy, even though we are close. And my friends understand these things. They are such very lovely people.\n\n**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI think I am very realistic. I do daydream just to escape temporarily from all the stress I just did to myself, but I can easily go back and finish the task I'm working on. When I daydream, I just stare because I can forget where I am, maybe my mind is trying to keep me at rest. I could also be lost in some music, but I would not be aware of my surroundings if that's the case. \n\n**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI would be thinking why I would be there. I mean, who would put me in that room. To be honest, I would try to escape. But if it's something I choose myself to ponder things, I would be thinking about the future. I would really like to talk to my future self if I am following the right path in the present or if I need to switch to another track. I was always not very sure about the path I chose but I am able to hold it firm until someone or something can make me realize that I am wrong. It never happened. That is why I like to talk to my future self if she could reassure me because I am not confident with the decisions I have made and will be making in the future. \n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt would take me days or even weeks to decide, especially if it's a very significant turning point in my life. I also would have done basic research on its consequences if it's possible. I also would ask my friends about it, even though they would not likely help me because our interests would not really align. And when I make my decision, I don't usually change it. It would be very hard at that point to change sides.\n\n**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nJust like when I'm making my decisions, I process my emotions hours to days before I respond to things. I am not very self-aware unlike my friends so I would need constant help checking myself. Emotions are just as important as any other part of me. They are the reflection of my subconsciousness. Something that I'm not aware of, but I'm fully capable of feeling. That is why in some situations, when usually I can't gather enough logical explanations, I would just trust my gut and decide with it. That's why I'm impulsive sometimes. \n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nIn some situations, yes. But NO to most people who would exist in my life consistently even if they were not so close to me. I would try to deliver my point of view. I am not very rash and aggressive in these situations, but I would not lie about my point of view. I would try to gather their views and explain to them why I think the opposite and try to make them understand me, too. And if they refuse to understand, like they would fight to dominate, I would not be elaborating because I know I could just waste my time and I don't like to be involved in conflicts I never aimed to join. There are some situations in which I could say yes because I know I would not meet that person again so setting the impression to them would not be very important. I would try to get out of the conversation with these types of people as easily as I can.\n\n**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nNo. I don't break rules but I think skepticism/criticism towards authority can still be done. And they never know better. I don't also know better. It's just a matter of values. If I think the authority would be abusing their power, I would not hesitate to give them a piece of my mind, especially when it affects the people I protect. However, when it happens to me and it's not affecting anyone else, I can be patient and ignore their shortcomings. I also think that I am capable of breaking the rules but I am just avoiding unnecessary conflict in my life.\n\n**What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nMy ideal life would be a life in which I would not seek approval from other people and those people would not be very judgemental of me. I mean, a peaceful life where people would just be kind and gentler would be enough. I have no materialistic standard for this, just peace overall.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI think these things would be all. I know this would not be enough to know my whole life, but at least I know it summarizes good points of my behaviors and overall experiences with the help of the guide questions. >!I often was identified as INFJ, which I don't relate much. I was also classified as INTJ and ENTP by the online tests, which made me more confused. !<I don't trust myself anymore.

{"submission": "Everytime I go online and ask for my type with me including some long tangent in depth of my cognitive functions. People describe me as ENFP. But I am so shy In real life and it doesn't convey properly in my text because Im not very in depth or anything. I am extremely socially anxious around people, but I hate being by myself. Yet I find that even though I dislike being by myself, being alone is what I do pretty much 24/7 Im always on my computer to 5 am or whatever on any game or doing something to get dopamine whether thats learning or messing around on a video game. Sometimes I just freak out and think all my friends hate me so then I go online and befreind like 500 people enjoy that dopamine and then never speak to them ever again. \n\nWith people, I can be super energetic but usually with most, I am worried I'll come off as weird and that they'll hate me. I'm also worried that I'll attach to tehm, because I tend to attach to anyone nice to me and obsess over them. I'm 90% sure I have ne, even though I lack imagination, I think I have ideas? just that I'm so scared to talk about them because I feel like I'm dumb.  I have fi, used to be stuck with that because I dont know who I am but I am always just wearing what I want and may have messy hair and I also never wear makeup and stuff I never conform to anyone. But at the same time I always worry when people are being excluded. But also I'm terrible at comforting people. I have si but I hate thinking about my past ,its just triggering but I am the first to notice when the surroundings of an area are different to how they were in the past. I thought I had se like I used to skateboard and parkour but now I just dont notice the present at all, but I'm not in imagination either, I'm just too busy having anxiety to think properly at all. Idk if I worry about 12 diff things or only one thing but Ik that I am not in the present, I dissociate quite a lot. The present just reminds me of the past now. But sometimes I can be very energetic and stuff and I run on adrenaline rushes sometimes. But I also have severe sensory overload. Its not like I think about the future either though... I really dont know. If it helps I also have autism, adhd and ocd.   Ti I score very high on pretty much every test cuz I love accuracy and I learn for the sake of learning a lot. Idk if I have ne because I have no idea how to read between the lines, I tend to overthink bodylanguage and get stuck on things. But Im also very open minded and can see how any idea can be good. Like if someone says that a method is bad I can be like \"but what if it isn't because...\"  so idk. I also did roleplay a lot. I'm pretty much never me, I'm just always feeling like a fictional character so maybe that counts as being in imagination I'm not too sure but thats all I do to cope with reality so...

{"submission": " \n\n I paid money to be typed but recently I have had many reasons to believe I was mistyped, so I'm giving my typing another go.  \n\n\nFeedback appreciated, I'm fucking tired of flip flopping between types \ud83e\udd27  \n\n\n**What do you study or do for a living? How did you come to do that? What do you like or dislike about it?**  \nI'm currently studding psychology and ding freelance translations. I've been into psychology since I was a teen so I bit the bullet and decided to try it on professionally after realizing that if it kept my interest so far is because it definitely has a lot of meaning to me.My mom has been hinting ta it for years too, telling me I have a knack for it and I think she's right.\n\n  \n**What else do you do on a daily basis? What are your interests and hobbies? Why do you do them?**  \nI have avery chill routine, wake up and make my mom breakfast before she goes to work, then start on the laundry and have my own breakfast reading the news on my interest fields, start my translations, stop for lunch and watching some Youtube or TikToks, work some more, make dinner and have it while watching some Netlix or something, then study. I love music (I'm specially into Kpop), typology, fashion, cooking and baking competition shows, learning about new cultures,, photography and videography, color theory. I do them because obviously they fascinate me, make me curious and give me pleasure.\n\n  \n**What are your values, and why?**  \nWhat does 'value' mean here? Just what I like or morals? This is super vague but I'll bite: I value truth, I'll take it at any cost, better an ugly truth than a beautiful lie, ignorance isn't bliss is decadence. I value freedom, nothing else has nay meaning or value without it. I value beauty, not just visual but anything that makes you elevated, like you just experienced something that proves the existence of God. I value wisdom, we were given mental abilities so e can learn and knowledge is power, but true knowledge is understanding, not just information. I value honor, be someone worthy of respect, don't do lowly things.  \n\n\n**Describe your relationships with family and friends. What do you like and dislike about them?**  \nI dislike super self centered people to the point where they become a nuisance to others, people who make empty promises, who are hypocrites and apply double standards, who never take responsibility or recognize mistakes, who love to talk badly about others or just won't shut up about other people's lives when I couldn't give a shit, who lie compulsively just to get attention etc.  \n**What do you look for in friends? In romantic relationships?**  \nGood character, honest, personality that is pleasant and interesting to me, give me attention and respect me and my boundaries.  \n**What conflicts have you encountered recently with other people? Why did they happen? Which kinds seem to happen on a regular basis?**  \nPeople who can't decide even simple things like what movie we're gonna watch for themselves, who make careless choices than want to change it at the last second inconveniencing me because they didn't really know hat they were picking in the first place. People who can't communicate clearly and directly about what they want and expect me to guess what they would like hen they don't even know it themselves.  \n**What are your strengths? What do people like about you? What do you like about yourself?**  \nI'm pretty smart and shrewd, it's extremely hard for something to get past me and fool me or catch me off guard without me clocking it miles ahead. I'm very direct and won't sugarcoat things thought in the recent years I have learned to deliver with more tact and care. I'm pragmatic in that I'm realistic and will always call a spade a spade and recognize that what I want and what is possible or more advantageous are many time very different things. I'm very ethical and take a hard line approach when it comes to the principles I believe are nonnegotiable.  \n**What are your weaknesses? What criticism do you often face from others? What do you dislike about yourself?**  \nI'm very inconsistent in my efforts when it comes to taking care of the house or my well being, I can't sustain a diet, exercise routine or house chores productivity schedule for long. I get distracted very easily by things that seem interesting and waste a lot of time jumping from video to video or article to article, my mind is very restless and needs fun most of the time. I used to be too cutting with people and I still am very impatient which at times makes me rude. I have a need to be good at things from the start that has stopped me from even trying some things or putting myself out there with others.  \n\n\n**In what areas of life can you manage well on your own? In what areas of your life would you like help?**  \nI'm good with budgeting, scheduling things, keeping tabs on resources but wish I didn't have to cook and clean everyday.  \n**What things do you dislike doing? What things do you enjoy more than others?**  \nAs already mentioned I dislike house chores and anything that demands waiting, also hen people ask me do to things for them they definitely can and should be doing themselves. I love studying my areas of interest through reading or watching content, analyzing people using typology is also a big hobby of mine.  \n**What goals, aspirations, or plans do you have for the future, and why?**  \nI wanna be healthy and happy, feel in peace with myself. Would love to have much more money and a much more full social life. Being proud of yourself is essential for complete self esteem and I wanna make my dreams reality.  \n**What kinds of things do you do to manage and/or beautify your environment (your room, your house, etc.)?**  \nBesides cleaning not much since I live with my mom so it's not my space so to speak. I do buy a bunch o cute gadgets and kitchen accessories though, they make working more pleasurable My room though I love decorating and ill alter it every new season (I love following a theme like 'all' or \"Christmas').  \n\n\n**If you won the lottery and didn't have to work anymore, what would you do?**Study music and photography, travel constantly, spend a lot on aesthetics.  \n\n\n**What traits do you find endearing that others might dislike? What traits are considered positive/neutral by others but tend to annoy you?**  \nI think shyness is often cute, and I detest conceited people, cockiness is a huge turnoff to me.  \n\n\n**How do you behave around strangers?**  \nThat totally depends on several factors: How are they treating me and others? Are there red flags? Are they boring?  \n**How do you react to conflict? What do you do if somebody insults or attacks you?**  \nI'm very assertive and pretty aggressive by nature so don't expect me to diffuse, I have zero tolerance for passive aggressiveness or childish pettiness. I wanna clear things up ASAP. When insulted if it matters i'll hit them thrice as hard, but if it's something or someone stupid I'll just ignore to piss them off more.  \n\n\n**Would you ever be interested in starting a business? Why or why not? What role would you play in it? What kind of business would it be?**  \nNo I'm not interested in that at all, don't see the appeal,not enough time or focus on me.  \n**How do you dress or manage your appearance?**  \nI'm very into studying body typing systems, personal essence and color analysis, so I care about working with hat I have and enhancing my strongest points. As Epictetus said \"Know first who you are and then adorn yourself accordingly\".  \n**Do you like kids? Why or why not?**  \nNo they usually are disrespectful**,** crude, stupid or really annoying.  \n\n\n**In what situations or times in your life did you feel most fulfilled, and why?**  \nWhen I'm doing something really well specially if there's an audience or when I'm just completely carefree enjoying myself.\n\n  \n**How do you feel about attention? Do you seek it out?**  \nLove it but don't seek it out most of the time, I think is cringe and embarrassing. Besides it only fees my vanity if it's natural.\n\n  \n**Your friend bursts into tears. What do you do? How does it make you feel?**  \nI panic, I have no idea how to console a person as I hate platitudes. I just get a glass of water or hand them a handkerchief, my nature is to offer solutions.\n\n  \n**What is something you regret?**Saying no to many opportunities because I didn't think myself capable and was terrified of failing.  \n\n\n**What are your spiritual or religious beliefs and why do you hold them?**  \nReligion is a tool for control and self delusion, I am spiritual instead.I believe in many things because they are proven or at lest heavily supported by my on experiences, those of other people and because they explain common phenomena.  \n**What kind of work environment do you prefer? What do you look for in a job?**  \nCompetent leadership, clear goals and expectations, defined roles, mutual respect, good resources for workers.  \n**What is or was your favorite school subject and why?**  \nEnglish (not my native language), I was great at that, it came naturally.  \n**What is one common misconception that people have about life? Explain why it is wrong.**  \nThat is complicated, it's not, people just don't wanna accept reality or use their minds.  \n\n\n**What do you do if you're not getting what you want? What approach do you use?**  \nIt totally depends on the situation, but usually I retreat and research, talk to other people, just gather more info or just wait. Timing is everything and sometimes is just not the right moment. Of course that if it's something I need done with urgency I'll compromise and get the next best thing, I'm pragmatic.  \n\n\n**Are you comfortable taking leadership roles? In what areas? Why or why not?**I was a pretty bossy child, then ran from leadership for my years since at school it meant picking everyone's slack and most were both lazy and incompetent, then realized things are better when I run a tight ship. If you want something well done than do it yourself and all.  \n\n\n**How often do you get angry? What kinds of things make you angry?**  \nI get irritated by many things I already mentioned previously often, but angry very seldom.I used to be angry a lot but a few years back I realized it made life heavier so I just started to let go and detached form many things that indeed were irrelevant and inconsequential.  \n**What is your sense of humor like? Do you joke around a lot?**  \nI'm either witty/sarcastic or pretty silly depending on the day, I joke around unless I'm stressed but I'm far from a class clown.  \n**What were you like as a child? How have you changed since then?**  \nSuper curious, asked many questions, a physical explorer, athletic and loved to perform in public and was very perfectionist about it, very active imagination that was triggered by my surroundings (nature), very social, loud and a bit bossy, talked a lot very fast, didn't know how to walk just run, polite and generally obedient, very attached to my dolls and characters in cartoons, very willful and would freely demonstrate displeasure, really worried about being 'bad', kinda Hermione Granger-like (wanted to be the best or at lest great at school and pressured myself to meet standards) emotions that oscillated between being intensely felt or a detachment from them as if it s happening to someone else, sometimes felt deep melancholy and loneliness (as bullied on and off for many years) that wouldn't express but were mirrored by certain songs lyrics. After 7 years of bullying I became very insecure, closed off, anxious and limbic for years. As an adult still working on healing I'm reserved, way less active, hate melancholy. Apart from that, I'm still the same: a weird mixture of hedonistic info junkie and controlling competence focus.

{"submission": "**My Traits (From most negative to most positive)**\n\n* At my worst, I am completely overwhelmed by worry and getting stuck in past experiences because what if I have ruined my life beyond repair and have NOT realized it until 3 years later? I can also become overly worried about painful diseases out of nowhere such as rabies.\n* I sometimes feel the need to repress my thoughts and feelings because if I get exposed, it feels like I have to explain all of my thoughts, especially the toxic ones, one by one, expect doomful judgment, and possibly grounding. And the thing is that, trying to repress actually generates even more anxiety, until I can\u2019t hide it anymore and I feel guilty for my own negative thoughts.\n* I can be rather lazy at times because I can be preoccupied with my identity and excessive amount of self-discovery. (Currently 19 years old, Male BTW)\n* I am rather fussy and easily annoyed by things, such as small details in environment (though they can be funny), and anything harmful to my health, such as secondhand smoke.\n* I tend to envy people who are: Having little to no worries, not obsessed about minor annoyances, able to act quickly without overthinking, automatically satisfied without much work, able to solve practical problems, able to handle stress calmly, trailblazing and acting without worrying about consequences, able to be carefree at all times, and able to be good at everything with little effort (though this can be me, more accurately, people who naturally act on their potential)\n* As for the types I envy the most, they are: ExxPs (especially Ne doms), ExFJs, Enneagram 7, Enneagram 3, Tritypes 137, 278, 279, 378, 379, 478, 479, Sanguine temperament, High IQ\n* I get angry when I feel like I am controlled unfairly for no reason, especially with mundane stuff. It doesn\u2019t become rage, but I feel the need to confront sometimes.\n* I make mental associations and find similar characters, objects, concepts, and many others in order to better understand myself and feel better as well. For example, my personality is similar to this YouTuber, this animal, this PC component, etc.\n* I have highly detailed memories and people appreciate me for that. Sometimes, I enjoy reliving my memories, and make associations with music, concepts, and gain inspiration.\n* Having a sense of purpose and efficiency is important but I end up learning a bunch of things just for the sake of it without practical purpose. I guess learning itself is just fun and efficiency comes after all that.\n* While I cared about being a good person, it wasn\u2019t perfect and I had a lot of wild moments. I would stress test devices out of sheer curiosity, take apart stuff, go to obscure places, etc.\n* I can adapt to a wide range of learning styles, such as visualizing it, relating it to other topics, interactive learning, etc. What I don\u2019t like is boring memorization with no real value (as ChatGPT is a thing), too much repetition, and most importantly, intolerance to innovation. It\u2019s super infuriating when you must use pencil and paper when you can use an iPad Pro.\n* As for the assignments, I am fine with unclear assignments when there can be loads of interesting ideas and creativity is valued. But if the professor is giving an unclear assignment with only one right way, it\u2019s like you are throwing darts until you find the right way. Or you don\u2019t. I also don\u2019t like overly strict assignments and mountains of boring homework.\n* For me, knowing the consequences are very important, though I sometimes fail to see consequences, it is still important for me because if I do something without knowing the consequences and I realize them way too late, it feels like unavoidable doom is coming. \n* I make a point in being honest and frank with my things. If I become too dishonest and secretive, I feel like a bad person at first and eventually, unavoidable disaster will derail me.\n* My relation with rules: Too many useless rules will annoy me. Of course, I would follow the laws by proper authorities, especially if they are fair, and also due to the fear of being trapped in dire consequences. When I\u2019m breaking them, it\u2019s usually because of forgetting them, or assuming it isn\u2019t there. With social etiquette, I am far more rebellious. And with the stupid rules made by regular people just to hold others back, I secretly rebel a lot of the times. I am never directly arguing unless I am caught and the rule is REAL stupid.\n* When I see a mistake, I am quick to point it out and fix them. I even used to march into the cashier\u2019s desk in order to learn all the details about that computer, and change the screen resolution so everything becomes clearer. Of course, I would do it in a good and casual way.\n* While I have a good amount of my favorites, I enjoy trying out new things in order to challenge myself and make the experience more meaningful. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t return to familiar stuff.\n* I don\u2019t work steadily, but rather, when I want to. It\u2019s like I do what I feel like I want to do at the moment rather than complying with a strict schedule.\n* I was individualistic throughout my life, and enjoyed working alone way more than in teams, because when I work alone, I have more freedom and control over the project, and I used to be quite shy when I was a child.\n* I care a lot about getting along well with people and understanding them. But I sometimes fail to do that and maybe say something \u201csharp\u201d on accident, or forget to take care of my hair.\n* I often do something new and exciting in order to challenge myself, learn new things, and maybe let that mental chatter go away. When I am not learning, I feel stuck and just surviving.\n* It\u2019s very important for me to make the ideal decision, which it makes me slow to make decisions at times. I need the ideal experience rather than many subpar experiences.\n* I am often capable of doing truly spontaneous stuff when I\u2019m feeling great such as starting a new language, doing a new type of workout, and create content, all on the same day.\n* I am intellectually curious and I love learning new things. A day without learning is wasted life.\n* I feel better when I am able to solve an intellectual problem or a challenge. They make me feel motivated and make me push forward.\n* I would really like to interact with the world around me and try them out. I used to hate boring lectures where you take notes by just writing what the teacher says and there\u2019s no meaningful learning involved there.\n* I am considered as sociable and enthusiastic, and I can talk about a great deal of topics, either picking up new things from my environment or my own fun knowledge. It can create funny moments and light-hearted enjoyment.\n\nI\u2019m kinda tired so that\u2019s all for now.

{"submission": "* **How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm a 27-year-old woman. I would describe myself as reserved, task-oriented, and respectful of others. I get stressed easily, but I'm also very calm and laid-back. I'm a good listener and I really enjoy playful banter. If I'm being totally honest, I'm not the most exciting person out there. I'm not excitable or outgoing, and I'm not much of a risk-taker. I'm ok with that, though.\n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was pretty standard. I'm an only child and I have older parents who are pretty religious. I shared their beliefs until I was in high school, at which point I started going in more of a spiritual direction.\n\n* **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI work in manufacturing and I really love it, although I don't want to do it forever. This is the first job I've had that isn't related to customer service, and it's a nice change. I really enjoy setting goals for myself and slowly rising to the top. Since I'm training to go into a type of management, I'm also being mentored and learning a \\*lot\\* about leading a team, and that experience has kinda turned my life around (for the better).\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI'd feel refreshed. When I'm going through a lot of stress or dealing with negative emotions, I isolate myself as much as possible for a few days/weeks/however long I need, and just reflect and keep myself entertained with books, shows, music, and games. It might not be the healthiest way of dealing with stress, but I can definitely think of worse ways. Plus, it got me out of a bad slump earlier this year.\n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?**\n\nI'm definitely not a sports person, but I do enjoy fitness and being active. I especially like weight-lifting and going on nature walks.\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nAbsolutely. I have a lot that I could improve on, but I sometimes train people at work and I think I'm becoming a pretty good leader. My leadership style is helpful and motivational. I really enjoy giving encouragement and positive feedback. However, my communication style when training or giving direction is very straightforward, and I sometimes worry about coming off as irritated or intimidating to more timid types of people (especially because I used to be very timid and unsure of myself).\n\n* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI think it's important to learn from the past, make the most of the present, and plan for the future. The one I struggle with most is the future. There are so many uncertainties in life that I sometimes see careful planning as a waste of time, even though I know it's important.\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nOf course I'm more inclined to help with annoying or stressful tasks if the person asking is someone I'm close with, but generally speaking, I help others when asked as long as the request isn't a huge inconvenience (ie. I'm only waking up at 5am for a small handful of people). I don't really think about why I help others; I guess if I can make someone's life a little bit easier, why not do it?\n\n* **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes. If my beliefs, values, or decisions are inconsistent or incompatible with each other, I feel the need to reevaluate them. I'm actually going through something like this right now: I have some spiritual and \"new age\" beliefs but I've also recently adopted the philosophy of existentialism. I'm not sure if these beliefs conflict with each other (due to contrasting ideas about cosmic justice) or if they are compatible (both are partly based on the idea that we each control our own destiny).\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nExtremely important. I take a lot of pride in my efficiency and productivity.\n\n* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nI play video games, especially open-world RPGs and roguelikes. I like immersing myself in the world of whatever game I'm playing, and I also think it's fun to play around with different builds and weapons. I also spend a lot of time listening to music, like limiting distractions and just getting lost in the beat or the lyrics. I'm not sure why I like to do this, but I always feel better after listening to a really good album.\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI learn best with a combination of hands-on experience and hearing (lectures, discussions, videos, etc). I struggle with learning environments that depend heavily on independent reading. For example, reading a chapter in a textbook is alright, but I benefit more from a break-down of key points and practical examples.\n\n* **What's important to you and why?**\n\nPersonal growth is important to me. I want to be constantly learning and evolving. If I'm not growing, I just feel like I'm in a slump, or aimlessly wandering through life. Deep emotional connections are also important to me. I'm not a very social person, but relationships in which I can be vulnerable are actually priceless.\n\n* **What are your aspirations?**\n\nI want to continue building my career and become an HR manager. In general, I would really like to be in a position where I can inspire others one day.\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nOne of my fears is losing the deep personal connections I have with a small group of people. I generally try not to care about what other people think, but there are exceptions, and sometimes I literally have nightmares about certain people getting mad at me. Excessive affection, especially romantic affection, makes me uncomfortable. I'm open to having relationships, but I just *can't* handle the grand gestures and overly sentimental stuff. It just seems so forced and, on a certain level, insulting. I hate when people either lack self-awareness or just have no regard for other people. I am *especially* irked by people who think it's ok to treat others poorly just because they're in a bad mood. Don't get me wrong, I occasionally get snappy when I'm stressed, but I just mean straight-up giving everyone dirty looks, ignoring people, etc.\n\n* **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nDuring the \"highs\" in my life, I have a healthy support system and am working toward something. I'm at a \"high\" right now.\n\n* **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nThe \"lows\" in my life can get pretty dark. I lose motivation to the point where I don't follow up with basic chores or hygiene. I gravitate toward toxic and manipulative people. This usually happens when I feel like I don't have any direction in life. I was at a \"low\" for a little over half a decade and I'm determined to never go back.\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt depends on the decision, but it usually doesn't take me very long to decide on important things. I think about my options until something just \"clicks\" and I know what I want to do. I can't think of an example, but I think I would definitely at least be open to changing my mind if I had new information or thought about factors that I hadn't considered before.\n\n* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nIt takes me a while. I tend to go emotionally \"numb\" when a highly emotional event happens, whether it's good or bad. I don't feel anything for a few hours or days, and then the feelings slowly sink in.\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nNot usually, but I will try to find common ground or even just nod and say, \"I see where you're coming from,\" if I don't think a deeper discussion will be productive. \n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI do not break rules often or really ever. I have mixed feelings about authority; it's something I value, but I also think it's important for authority figures to be open to feedback and earn respect instead of just expecting it.\n\n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nI haven't figured that out yet.", "clean_guess": "Capricorn", "llm_guess": "Capricorn", "logprobs": {"Cap": [{"token": "Cap", "logprob": -0.25677788}, {"token": "Vir", "logprob": -1.5849029}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -4.225528}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -5.413028}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -6.834903}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -7.647403}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -8.256778}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -8.272403}, {"token": "CAP", "logprob": -9.444278}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.959903}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.991153}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -10.163028}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -10.194278}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -11.194278}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -11.584903}, {"token": "Conclusion", "logprob": -11.600528}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -12.022403}, {"token": "Caps", "logprob": -12.038028}, {"token": "A", "logprob": -12.084903}, {"token": "Leo", "logprob": -12.381778}], "ric": [{"token": "ric", "logprob": -2.3392786e-06}, {"token": "r", "logprob": -13.250002}, {"token": "icorn", "logprob": -14.625002}, {"token": "ri", "logprob": -16.781252}, {"token": "roc", "logprob": -18.187502}, {"token": "rc", "logprob": -18.187502}, {"token": "irc", "logprob": -18.765627}, {"token": "RIC", "logprob": -19.437502}, {"token": "ris", "logprob": -19.484377}, {"token": "rico", "logprob": -19.625002}, {"token": "corn", "logprob": -19.765627}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -20.382814}, {"token": "pr", "logprob": -20.55469}, {"token": "orn", "logprob": -20.55469}, {"token": "rec", "logprob": -20.625002}, {"token": "rac", "logprob": -20.92969}, {"token": "ac", "logprob": -21.078127}, {"token": "c", "logprob": -21.30469}, {"token": "rich", "logprob": -21.343752}, {"token": "rica", "logprob": -21.382814}], "orn": [{"token": "orn", "logprob": -1.1756368e-05}, {"token": "orns", "logprob": -12.156261}, {"token": "ron", "logprob": -13.609386}, {"token": "om", "logprob": -13.656261}, {"token": "orne", "logprob": -14.140636}, {"token": "on", "logprob": -14.554699}, {"token": "orm", "logprob": -14.625011}, {"token": "ord", "logprob": -14.734386}, {"token": "or", "logprob": -14.796886}, {"token": "oin", "logprob": -15.804699}, {"token": "one", "logprob": -15.812511}, {"token": "ORN", "logprob": -16.195324}, {"token": "orno", "logprob": -16.671886}, {"token": "ont", "logprob": -16.726574}, {"token": "ore", "logprob": -16.867199}, {"token": "orna", "logprob": -16.867199}, {"token": "c", "logprob": -16.953136}, {"token": "orny", "logprob": -16.992199}, {"token": "\u00f3n", "logprob": -17.085949}, {"token": "ton", "logprob": -17.125011}]}}

Describe your activity?\n\nI really like working with my hands, and basically the only way i can learn things are by doing them myself. i run cross country and track.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI don\u2019t daydream very often and live in the present. if i do daydream, i am still aware of my surroundings.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI am pretty good at making decisions. I use logic to make them. I might change my mind though. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions?\nHow important are emotions in your life?\n\nEmotions are hard for me. I don\u2019t like them, and struggle to process them.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNot usually. The only time I just agree with others is if i dont want to make a big deal. usually i say what i think.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nI am usually a rule breaker. i think rules are meant to be challenged. i break rules if i think it is necessary, or if i am trying to figure something out.\n\nThanks for reading this long and confusing post.

{"submission": "This is probably going to be a little messy, but here are a list of traits that I have noticed in myself.\n\nI think what people often note about me is that I am very laidback and agreeable on the surface, but also very intense underneath. Should note that this agreeableness is not really the people pleasing \"oh I am happy with whatever you are happy with!\" kind of behaviour, moreso adaptable and willing to try other things, so more of a \"oh, that sounds like a good idea, I'll hop on that train too\" kind of tone. However, I do have my own agendas and beliefs of what is right and wrong, so I can seem flexible UNTIL something crosses those personal values and then I become stubborn and tenacious. Another way it can show up is I can seem like I am just adapting to the situation, but in reality I am leveraging the circumstances for my own ends, and people don't realize that/couldn't see it until afterwards when they step back for the bigger picture.\n\nI realized the other day that my best and worst trait all have to do with the same problem I have: I am very terrible at prioritizing. Everything seems important to me. As such, at best, I tend to be great strategist or tactician, plotting out a plan that takes care of EVERYTHING, every angle, every person, every detail. All planned out so we do not have to make any sacrifices. At my worst, I procrastinate or become a complete multi-tasking mess because I simply cannot decide on what to do first, thus end up in a deadlock or trying to do too many things at once.\n\nI think I find the idea that \"the world is just the way it is\" very offensive. I am obsessed over the idea of transformation, alchemy, and shapeshifting. I love the idea of getting to control how things are to your very whims. To be able to shape the world and yourself to your heart's content is something that I have fantasies about. However, this does mean that I get frustrated implicitly when people tell me things just have to be a certain way.\n\nI am generally a man of action. When I can have a clear goal, either because I finally got around to prioritizing properly or because the situation did it for me through emergency or a very angry boss, then I can be very decisive with my actions and I am not afraid of tiredness or frustration. What matters is that I am working and I am in the right direction. My mother noted once that she found me happiest when I was busy yet not chaotic, and I am inclined to agree.\n\nI am a little self-absorbed, admittedly. My thought processes are often all about my own introspections, projects, and developments. The going-ons of the world is off secondary concern. This often means I can be having a good day because my projects are on the right track, only to suddenly realize I forgot to check in with family and friends for a few weeks. Or I may be making progress with self-development, but totally forget to read the news to get the latest on world events. There is often a sense of \"what does this have to do with me\" that I instinctively feel about news, and so I often have to reason myself into caring about the world. (everything impacts finance, could be good socializing topic, etc.)\n\nI definitely like sciences more than humanities and commerce. I like things that are definitely true and logical. People don't always compute for me, even if I do my best to be polite and empathetic. I think that's more so my own fault for being too task-oriented sometimes. Not that I come across as blunt or cold, mind you. I have gotten good at memorizing what you're supposed to do in certain social situations. (e.g. just quietly practice active listening if you notice someone here to vent rather than wanting to solve problems.) BUT this is still memorization of \"correct answer\". I don't fundamentally understand the need to vent, if I'm fully honest. I think I just treat socialization as a fun puzzle, both in the sense of \"can I handle this situation gracefully\" and \"can I figure out how their mind works\". I love trying to probe what people's central motives and values are. It's fascinating how even very close people can have wildly different answers.\n\nThat being said, for work, I would much rather be working on something more logical. For example, if I, a programmer, ever get the chance to get a promotion, I most likely would go for architect and then CTO route rather than manager and then CEO route. I need my work to be mostly logical and technologically based. That is where I find fun but also where I find comfort.\n\nI can often daydream when I am not actively doing anything. Usually this is daydreaming some kind of action film scene that could happen in this situation I am in, (e.g. if I am in a bus, what if it flips, how would I react that would look cool yet be practical) or it might be based on a piece of fiction that I know of, also action genre. (e.g. daydreaming about what mask I would use if I was in the world of Hotline Miami)\n\nI don't know if I am really extroverted or introverted, socially speaking. I can deal with people okay, and I know how to initiate conversations, but I don't know if I really get drained or energized by it. I will say that I absolutely love hanging out with a small group, especially one-on-one time. That's because this is the time when all the secrets and truth comes out. People admit to their insecurities, dreams, passion in ways that they could never dream to say in places with a lot of other people. I like that truthfulness. Hanging out with a lot of people is irritating because now everyone is playing the social game and everything feels so......fake. I can stand being alone, but being with a small group is ideal. So I guess my preference goes small group > alone > large group. (to me small group is 3 and under. More than that and people start to play social games in my experience)\n\nI noticed in a conversation with some of my friends that I tend to be more cynical of other people's intentions than most people. I seem to default to thinking that everyone necessarily only care about their own priorities and plans, and you only value to them IF it fits their agenda. If you're now thinking \"this guy is projecting real bad\" then you'd be right. That's the conclusion I came to as well. However, this does mean that altruism or even just caring for the sake of caring doesn't exist in my worldview. Great example of this was in college one time a few of our friends were hanging out together and I had to leave early after having downed a few beers. One of my friends turned to me with a very genuinely concerned face and asked if I was okay and I just stopped in my tracks. For some reason I was completely not expecting her to care about me in that moment. I couldn't calculate any personal benefit for her to ask me that, so I just froze for a few seconds before recovering and saying I'll be okay. That's how bad my cynicism is sometimes. To be fair, I was raised with a somewhat social darwinist ideology in my family/culture.\n\nI have found that I dislike collaborating with others to some degree.

{"submission": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI am 24 years old and a man, I'd say I'm quite reserved, stoic, and unexpressive, I enjoy exercise in the form of gym, general sports with friends and some combat sports. I've in self improvement for a while now and want to work on becoming better, I've also started a business but haven't worked on it much if at all due to just being lzy. While I don't enjoy my station in life I generally enjoy it, my ultimate goal is to help people on a large scale in some way, mainly through the medium of healthcare or tech or a combination of both. My natural bent is towards large scale societal changes to impact the future generations and improve, though I am also curious about other things such as science and art. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nNot that I know of \n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nNo real religious structure, aside from a few times where we went to church, Christmas, easter etc, I treated it as part of tradition and didn't mind since I played with other kids there. As I got older I began to value certain traditions and am now Christian. There was a lot of structure from my parents which I appreciated and help me a lot, I apply structure to my own life but I believe a little differently to the one given in childhood.\n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI studied neuroscience, and have worked in jobs unrelated to it, I didn't like them as they were repetitive boring tasks which had no real difficulty or point, they didn't help me towards my goals, and were just a means to generate income. I seem to prefer more mental tasks probably because they remind me of my study. In future I want to become a doctor, and occupy higher positions within that field. \n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would enjoy it, most of my weekends involve church and seeing others, but a nice weekend, especially getting away in a small city etc would be extremely pleasant and refreshing, I think it'd be a great time to reflect over the events of the week, where I want to go and how my actions impact my direction. Although sometimes hanging out with others during the weekend is good too.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nMy coordination is poor within sports, and like with most things I get better mainly through tons of repetition, e.g with combat sports I practice certain attacks and combos until they feel natural and intuitive. I want to explore more of the outdoor world and also enjoy gym, climbing etc. I do like sports once im good enough to play them. I also enjoy reading, whether it's philosophy or manga etc. I want to get into art as I did it quite often as a early teenager. \n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI definitely have a lot of ideas of what I would like to do and accomplish, I would like to learn to cook gourmet dishes (at least 3-5 in a year),  I want to have an amateur mma fight, I want to build my business, I want to travel often and recreate certain things I see. However I do have plans and structure to help me do these things. My ideas can be a mix of both, It depends on what is inspiring me. I try to narrow down my ideas to the things I like most. \n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?** \n\nI think in future I would enjoy taking on leadership position, in the past I have been put into them due to achievement and having a direction for my own life which may cause others to want to follow me. I've struggled with leadership positions in not knowing intuitively how to get individuals to follow since im more solitary but I want to build up leadership skills necessary in future. My main way of leading comes through leading through example, being diplomatic and having a vision for the team. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI'm not too coordinated but I'm not too clumsy either. Less so than most people but not obviously so. I haven't worked with my hands in a while but I remember fixing my bike, looking into my car and some product design projects which required use of my hands, they were great for relaxing and focusing on one task. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI used to draw and write poetry when younger but haven't done so in a while I would like to start. When I consume are its usually in music, I don't mind more abstract music or even non serious forms. With paintings I enjoy realism and surrealism. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI don't think too much about the past unless it's to inspire me, the present is great as its readily available to manipulate for a certain more improved future but also to just enjoy. \n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI don't mind too much, can be annoying if I have to leave something im doing at the moment. I would help them due to a sense of obligation. \n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI would say so. \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nDepends on the task at hand, if its just fun then not too much, if it comes to accomplishing certain goals then It is very important in my life, until I reach a point of long term stability, however other than that it should be ok. \n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI control others possible through actions, I act on certain goals and try to do them regardless of others opinions, this may cause others to do similar.\n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nCombat sports feel amazing, use of entire body, can be strategic or tactical, constant self improvement, fun to fight others and learn from each other, inspires discipline, can still improve alone, with another person or in a group. I enjoy learning to play guitar and cooking mainly to find other forms of art to enjoy and in future show this to others. \n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI enjoy sitting down a reading through text to fully understand it, then breaking it down and testing myself. I enjoy competition too. I struggle the most with group tasks and action oriented work, it seems too distracting, to focus on others and what is being done over the content. \n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI'd say when it comes to goals, strategising is fairly straight forward, I start with an end goal or point, break it down into long term, mid term and short term goals/actions, and break it down into weekly/daily tasks with weekly admin check ups. I like to also leave time to wing certain things and improvise. But I do not freestyle most of the time. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nMy aspirations include becoming a doctor, building a business to a high degree within 6 - 8 years with room for more. Retire my family. Then improve other aspects of my life including getting to the peak of my physique, marrying a woman I respect and starting a family. Enacting a specific change on society to help others in future. \n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI fear not being competent enough to help myself and others. I fear not being able to accomplish what I set out to and being restricted to certain ways of living. I hate needless cruelty, one of the few things which makes me quite proactive in doing something about it. I believe it relates to my goal to help others/ world.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nSucceeding, taking in the physical beauty of certain parts of the world around me, helping others in family and celebrating wins of other people.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nAnger, giving in to vices. Not working hard enough. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI daydream very often but am easily able to snap back to reality quickly. I'm also aware of my surrounding when I do so.\n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI reflect on my future and what I want out of it. I think about my life so far and why it is this way and if this is what I want. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nNot too long maybe a week or so depending on the decision. With reasonable arguments I may change my mind. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nemotions are important to life and the human experience in general. It takes me a while to process mine, I believe they may be quite childish and may need more development in future. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI agree with others point of view and try to offer alternatives unless I have other opinions which might enhance the conversation through discussion. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nI don't break rules often, authority should be challenged but not just for the sake of it, sometimes to test it and ensure its good.

{"submission": "1) How would you describe yourself?\n\nHighly self-directed, independent, free spirit, very friendly, always amused about something, assertive but able to be tactful, adrenaline junkie, highly intense/piercing energy\n\n2) What are your aspirations? And values?\n\nTo be a nomad and travel the world going on adventures. As for values, I think the only one I really have, is freedom/honouring others' free will.\n\n3) What do you spend your free time on? What do you daydream about?\n\nDoing a million projects/ideas at once (note: I have ADHD so this may be independent of type), fitness, and self-improvement for sure. I daydream about success half the time, the other half, I daydream about being a literal god lmfao.\n\n4) What would you change about the world, if you could?\n\nDefinitely less red tape and restrictions, and more second chances to people. People shouldn't be barred from life over a drug conviction. The only exception being child abusers/rapists. Off them unceremoniously. People shouldn't need licences for every little thing, and there are too many safety rules imo. Also, intellectual property laws are way overboard, and it stifles creativity.\n\n5) What's your general view of people? Including people you love and dislike\n\nThey're just animals lol. They amuse me most of the time. Even people I dislike (I don't actively dislike anyone unless they've done something against me or a loved one), I kind of get off on purposely annoying them (in a way where I won't get in trouble, that way I can keep doing it. I love the reactions lmao). With people I love, that's different. I can be VERY protective of them, and I put them first when it comes to major decisions (within reason).\n\n6) What limit (i.e. time, gravity, etc.) bothers you most?\n\nfucking EVERYTHING lmfaooo. laws of physics. laws of biology. human-made limits especially; it's pure masochism. This world in general feels like a type of jail that I'm trying to repurpose into a playground lol.\n\n7) What's the biggest thing people don't often notice about you? And why do you think this is?\n\ni'm not as snooty and distant as I might seem (irl). I just have pride issues, so I refuse to give my time/attention to others first because I won't allow anyone to think they hold power over me. But if they approach me and reveal themselves honestly to me, then (assuming I like them to begin with) I'll make sure they never regret it.

{"submission": "if you've seen a similar description before, it's not surprising, as it's just a much more complete version of it.To begin with, I have absolutely no clear opinion about myself. And perhaps this will be one of the few things in which I am sure. This also applies not only to me as a person, but also to my overall perception and ability to process information. In past reports, I did not write this, since I remembered only recently, but apparently it went on since childhood. The fact is that in my deep childhood I had excellent abilities for self-hypnosis and an equally terrible memory as now, in principle. One way or another, because of this, I confused real events with fictional ones, or simply confused real events with each other extremely often. I sometimes argued with my relatives because of this (they thought that I was deliberately inventing and lying), later I became aware of this problem, based on some facts, so I can write about it now.Anyway, I'll try to go to the description:\n\n1. I am weak-willed and timid. I do not remember exactly my first meeting with a stranger (which is not surprising), but my parents told me that I was afraid of the people around me in childhood, except for my closest relatives. I was even afraid of my own brother. I practically could not talk freely with anyone except them and a couple of people until about 5 years old. Therefore, my parents began to send me to many circles and extracurricular activities. In general, they managed to socialize me, but I acted by adjusting to others (later I got too carried away with him and got into not the most pleasant situations, losing control over them and completely forgetting myself, so now I, before joining a company in communities  , I analyze it, and if it seems to me personally acceptable and comfortable, then I make attempts to adapt).\n2. I also struggle with feelings of embarrassment and shame from early childhood. (I noticed this trend: the more I communicate, the more this feeling overtakes me, being alone and processing all my actions lately). However, the problem is probably not so much in the amount of communication, but in my perception of what I can be ashamed of. I myself do not clearly understand my values, so I'm not sure. I made attempts to ignore my feelings, because sometimes I had to be in a team by force. However, in the end, nothing worked out, I myself do not notice how feelings sometimes cover me. Then I thought that since I can\u2019t change myself, it\u2019s easier to change circumstances and I just try to minimize most contacts. However, there are often outbreaks and I break down, repeating the same mistakes. Heh...\n3. I am a big procrastinator. With difficulty I force myself to do something, again from early childhood, from primary school. Later this problem got worse. I also have a hard time concentrating my attention sometimes even on what may be interesting for me, not to mention complex unwanted material. I am a moral weakling and if some lecture or text seems difficult to me, I automatically switch off and go into my thoughts. Even forcing yourself to deliberately penetrate comes out with difficulty and not for long.\n4. Concerning doubts and a way of adjustment. I was often told that the reason for this may be the lack of support for the expression of one's own desires, personality on the part of the parents, but in my case it was quite the opposite. My parents always tried to develop this in me, they were interested in my desires, but I never really knew what I wanted. Heh:\\_)\n5. I can definitely say that I value emotional and material stability. I am much more comfortable in a permanent environment. I can hardly stand various kinds of trips, I do not seek to change my physical environment. I am also good at recognizing my physical inner sensations, which I often did not like, as I cannot ignore any discomfort, no matter how hard I try. Emotional stability is easier for me to leave to my surroundings, since I myself have problems coping with my feelings, so I always look for the society where it exists by default.\n6. In general, I am almost always aware of my surroundings (at least I do not have complete blackouts in consciousness), but I do it vaguely, almost never delving into its details. So I usually don't default to making up the big picture based on the details around me like people with se-ni/ni-se do. Most of the time, I'm in a semitone in my thoughts. As far as I know, this is the most common case.That's all for now lol. Thanks for reading.

{"submission": " \n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest fear? My biggest fear is getting rejected. Whenever I get rejected or treated like and outsider, I get really angry and end up getting caught in the moment and I might do something I'll regret. What\u2019s your biggest desire? To have a peaceful and organized environment. What are you \u2018\u2019the best\u2019\u2019 at? Reading through people's intentions and knowing how they feel. How do you see yourself right now? Normally? I don\u2019t know about this question. How do you see yourself 5 years from now? Working like most people? I don\u2019t know for sure what I\u2019ll be doing, I just know I\u2019ll be alive. How do you express yourself? Through my environment. My environment influences my mood a lot so if my environment reminds me of bad parts of my past I might act rude or so on. How do you feel about those near you (family, friends)? I have had a bad relationship with them so I don\u2019t know quite honestly. How do you feel about strangers? I usually care too much about what they think or when I'm overwhelmed I'll be very rude to them. How do you view change/uncertainty? I hate it. It makes me feel weird like I start to question other things too or just stress about the change. How do you make decisions? Based on how others would react to it and objective facts. How do you solve logical problems? Using objective logic. How do you deal with your emotions? I bottle them up until I cannot hold them in anymore and explode on people. What drives you in life? What do you look for? The thing that mainly drives me in life is peace and comfort. What do you hope to accomplish in your life? Again I just want an organized and peaceful environment as I don\u2019t do well in chaotic environments because they overwhelm me. What do you hope to avoid doing or being? What values are important to you? I avoid being weird and avoid doing stuff that makes me feel out of charecter. I have too many values to put here. How do you want others to see you? How do you see yourself? I want others to see me as normal or average. I want to fit it but also have my own style at the same time. Describe how you experience each of: a) Anger; b) Shame; c) Anxiety A. I usually bottle it up until I say something hurtful. B. I usually hide it or have a saddening look on my face. C.

{"submission": "Hello. Oh  no, writing stuff about myself?! I don't even know who I really am..... or do I? Guess I should have kept my username Eternallyconfused instead, haha. So I'll just use this life saving guide prepared by yall.\n\n \n\n* **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nSheltered upbringing. Surrounded by the 4 walls of the room. School was the only activity I had. Became more and more quiet. Slowly lost all friends and didn't really know what to talk about and how to behave like a kid of that age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nLonely. Bored. Even though weekdays can be tiring and I look forward to the weekends....I've observed that spending whole day by myself makes me feel cranky and low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nI love swimming and have self-trained myself watching youtube videos. Dont know how to play any other sport so cant comment on the same. I read and try to learn new things, but after a certain period of time I find it really difficult and might get fidgety and irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI am quite curious and tend to think of doing new things. I've even tried making Youtube videos while I was stuck at home for a while. I think its more environmental as I keep thinking about creating something with my hands or to go out and interact with the environment outside. I like understanding concepts and questioning them.  I follow stoicism and find it to be quite helpful and interesting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nYes. But I don't like ordering people. I would do my own bit but make sure others are doing their bit too and that their opinions are also being taken into consideration while taking a decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nIm not really sure about that. Most of the times I am stuck in my room with my thoughts which can make me overthink n feel a bit lost which is quite common and natural. But yes, I like working out when I do and feel better and in control of my surroundings when I move more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI like helping people. I guess, I like being needed. But if they repeatedly ask for help, it gets a lil annoying coz they are just using me then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nIt is important. I feel disappointed in myself if a day passes by and I do nothing of value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI don't like it when the speaker is continuously speaking and we are supposed to just listen to them and understand. I like interactive sessions where I'm a part of the process. Also I'm not a fan of rote learning. I like visualising and find flowcharts, mind maps etc to be useful too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI used to fear a couple of things, but now I don't. It was difficult to put myself out of my comfort zone and face it but now I feel great. But there is one thing I fear and sorta dislike... and that is flowers. I dont know why. Other pet peeves of mine are: unnecessary talks, interruptions while speaking, very loud people and hypocrites.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nUsed to, as a sort of escapism. Still do sometimes when really bored or stressed. But I'm aware of my surroundings while I daydream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nDepends. I struggle with indecisiveness sometimes but I'm trying to overcome it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nI sometimes used to. But usually I say my point only when I think its worth it. Otherwise, I just ignore n stay silent or try to change the topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI usually follow rules as they are made to prevent chaos. But if something doesn't make sense, I simply try not to follow it or raise my concern. I do not pick unnecessary fights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nI want to experience as many things as I can in this short time I have. My ideal life would be to do as I please without being controlled or forced to live as others want me to. I'd Like to spend more time with nature and explore this world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, Thank you for reading this lengthy post of mine.

(Beat them up till they bled)\n- Did my work always on time but didn\u2019t have alot of personality other than the fact that I like transformers movies and toys.\n- If I was asked how I felt about something I would always refer to statistics I found online or studies (what do you think of black people)? \n- I only followed what authority followed because I felt like if I didn\u2019t I feared the punishment if I didn\u2019t. It also gave me a sense of assuredness knowing exactly what to do in a situation.\n- I didn\u2019t start daydreaming alot until I was 8-9. \n- When asked to draw something creative I tend to use \u201cgeometric shapes\u201d more than flowing drawings. (A square or a rectangle and out them together)\n- I liked non-fiction more than fiction because fiction felt like I couldn\u2019t learn something from.

I never even asked alot of why questions until I was 16. \n- My music tastes was based more on what others listened to back then.\n- Didn\u2019t start looking into who I WANTED TO BE back then. It was irrelevant at the time. \n- Would stay away from everyone. \n- Very very good with athletics and could easily outrun everyone. \n- Didn\u2019t actively try to become more creative until I was 15. Until this age I was not described as creative. \n- Weirdly enough I was extremely organized at this age.

{"submission": "Here\u2019s my attempt at doing the questionnaire! Keep in mind I can get very formal when responding to questions and this isn\u2019t my casual way of speaking. Also I\u2019m physically unable to answer questions without over-explaining myself so, enjoy! ;D also I link to my quiz results if anybody needs them! But please help me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nHello! I\u2019m 17F, have ADHD, the type I usually get in tests is INFP, ENFP & ENTP follow closely behind. My enneagram is possibly 4w5 & my tritype is 458(?) I enjoy dabbling in all things art from drawing, to music/singing, to theatre, to writing, comics/manga, shows/anime, movies, and much more that I don\u2019t want to think too hard abt, but you get the idea. Even as a child, I\u2019ve always saw myself as a soul within this meat suit just floating through life. An observer of sorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI have very strict traditional Asian parents who are very religious. (ESxx mother & ENTP father) Thankfully I\u2019ve researched about my own religion enough to separate culture from religion and know when they\u2019re parading culture or their own ideals as \u2018religion\u2019 and I\u2019ve always strongly retaliated to it, which has gotten me in trouble with my parents many a time. Other than that, my parents parenting style was.. all over the place. There was no proper structure, if anything it was *lacking* in structure. No specific dinner time, chores were divided randomly and quickly neglected, and any attempt to have any kind of structure would all end in vain since nobody in my family is ever on time to anything nor can they conform to a schedule. I used to be very neutral about the unstructured thing, it was all I ever knew, and in a way I saw my freedom in that sliver of a grey area. But sometimes my parents constant lack of stability does bother me, especially when *I\u2019m* expected somewhere and have to rely on them only to come egregiously late. A lot of their parenting also seemed to hinge on using intimidation in order to gain obedience, but after a while I learned to ignore it anyway & became better at hiding things from them. As the saying goes, strict parents make sneaky kids. Although don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t abstain from some nice malicious compliance before rubbing it in their face;)\n\nI was also completely online schooled for my entire life so I grew up on the internet, and my parents didn\u2019t take steps to socialize me or my siblings, so I had to take my own initiative to learn the social game all on my own\u2014 albeit rather late for my age. Nothing will bring back all those pivotal years I\u2019ve missed of understanding the social structure, and even more-so as a neurodivergent person, but it is what it is and I\u2019ve done the best I could with the cards I was dealt. (or at least I hope)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What career path are you interested in pursuing? \n\nEither in art or science (specifically biology pertaining to the natural world, biologist, botanist, marine biologist, etc). Art is a hobby, a passion of mine, which is why I\u2019m unsure about taking it as a career. I fear it might make me lose my passion for it, it\u2019ll become a chore rather than a de-stresser. If I did take art, I\u2019d be a concept designer or character designer since those bring me joy, but it doesn\u2019t pay as good as science either.   \n\n\n*  If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nDepends. If I have been stressing myself out and hanging out with too many people I\u2019ll *need* that weekend to relax and realign myself. If I haven\u2019t spoke to people in a long time and I\u2019m going to have to spend a whole weekend alone, I\u2019d likely be very lonely, buuut I can self entertain and make the best out of it and forget about it in no time. But I can go a long time before reaching that utterly lonely point, it kind of just hits me one day how alone I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI\u2019m very dissociated from myself and reality. I\u2019m always lost in a thought, although I can never recall what since I have the memory of a goldfish. I lose some grasp of reality when I daydream and have to get torn out of it, the world around me just becomes a buzz when I\u2019m zoned out.   \n\n\n*  What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nRelated to my previous point, I have to make an effort to be in sync with the real world, I have to remind myself I\u2019m a real person and push myself out to capture memories or the feelings of the moment, but even then it\u2019s like sand slipping past my fingers. I do like being immersed in the natural world, but as the background to zoning out or to tuck it away into my lil folder of creativity in my brain. There\u2019s something about it that soothes some deep part of my soul and puts me at ease, I used to love playing or studying outside even if it meant playing alone for hours. I\u2019m unable to do that now, but the natural world still brings me comfort.   \n\n\n*  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would call myself a very curious creature, I can thread thoughts and string out a whole web of ideas in no time. I like exploring everything or falling into a million rabbit holes at 3 am. It\u2019s usually hypotheticals that I explore, \u201cwhat would happen to earth\u2019s tidal & oceans if the moon was destroyed\u201d, \u201cwhat would life be like if 95% of the world was covered in water\u201d, and more. I also love exploring real life phenomena, or stupid cryptid shit with that little kid at the back of my mind hoping more than anything that they exist even if I know better. I also love anything about extinct animals, especially ones humans weren\u2019t able to document well like prehistoric animals or dinosaurs. I think I gravitate towards hypotheticals and things just beyond reality because I love that gray area of not knowing the full truth for absolute certain and being able to freely imagine what it could be like. \n\nI also love learning about things so I can use them as inspiration, like I use all my knowledge of evolution and anatomically accurate animal biology I\u2019ve attained to make mythical creatures in my worlds seem like real creatures.   \n\n\n*  Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI\u2019m currently somewhat in a leadership position right now, I\u2019m the VP of one of the biggest clubs in our school. I like to think I\u2019m better at taking an adviser role in leadership rather than the final decision maker. I am more than happy to dump my never-ending supply of ideas and have someone else refine it down or make decisions. However, if I was forced to pick just one idea at gunpoint\u2026. I might as well already be 6 feet under.   \n\n\n*  What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI\u2019m both afraid of and look forward to the future, it\u2019s too unpredictable but there\u2019s also so many opportunities!\u2026 but oh god there\u2019s so many opportunities\u2026 what am I supposed to do?? What if I make a single incorrect choice that ends up messing everything up for me? What if I completely miss an opportunity because I didn\u2019t grasp for it in time? The future gives me strife so I prefer not to think of it too hard or I might actually lose what\u2019s left of my sanity. \n\nThe past I hold dearly, especially my childhood, I\u2019d do anything to turn back time. I think that\u2019s a coping mechanism lol. I analyze my past and how it affects me now, I even make connections on why I act the way I do because of my past.\n\nPresent, I don\u2019t really know what I do. I exist. I try taking opportunities as they come, but I also just live in silence in my own head most of the time. To be honest I\u2019m not really sure *what* I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf it was my friends I would do anything for them, drop everything, even if it means putting them above family. Keep in mind that\u2019s only out of my own will, I *want* to do that, if I didn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t even bother offering or accepting. I like making the people happy or just make their lives easier, it fulfills me. Just in general with anyone, I just trust my gut. If I want to help them, I will do everything in my power to, and if I don\u2019t want to I won\u2019t get out of my way too. More often than not I\u2019ll want to as I see it as a fun challenge and if I do accept you bet your ass I will disregard my entire life schedule to help until things are solved.   \n\n\n*  Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI have a reasoning for a lot of the things I do, I don\u2019t like doing things with no reason behind it (but I find myself doing that more often than not). I have a subconscious that figures things out for me and every time I purposely didn\u2019t listen to it I\u2019ve messed things up for myself. I kind of need a rule of some kind to something, even if small, just so I understand the parameters\u2014 or if something doesn\u2019t have any written rules but has a pattern, I feel the need to vaguely follow that pattern or I feel I might do something wrong. But I\u2019m also always very open to new ideas or concepts to expand my worldview, so I never see anything quite as set in stone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nRarely. I think I get controlling if I get invested in or feel strongly about something, or someone took something I was looking forward to doing. Example: say I worry heavily about cleanliness, if I see someone I know washing a dish sloppily I\u2019d probably start nit-picking the way they\u2019re washing it because I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to get sick from eating from that dirty dish. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s something out of my control and I worry it isn\u2019t going to be done properly to it\u2019s fullest, and since I can\u2019t do anything my reaction is to try and fix it or mold it to my vision even if it\u2019s not exactly my place to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nSince I have ADHD settings where I can see a clear examples playing out and I prefer a clear explanation behind it, so I can break it down to a formula in my head and reuse it later to a somewhat related thing that I can reasonably guess follow that same pattern. However, I prefer classes where I don\u2019t have to think too hard, it just comes to me naturally or I can use common sense to figure out the answer easily. So I suppose that\u2019d be classes that help me utilize logic & creativity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI\u2019m good at strategizing, especially for others, but I\u2019m unable to follow through on my own since my motivation drips down the drain really easily. I will say maybe I tend to overestimate how much I\u2019ll be able to do since I can\u2019t gauge myself that well and end up feeling disappointed in myself. I usually end up procrastinating until the very last second where I grind it all out at once, and somehow I work better this way.   \n\n\n*  What's important to you and why?\n\n1. Treat others like how you want to be treated (literally). A more extreme example (that I do) to get my point across: I\u2019d like people to call me out on my shit, so I call people out on their shit. \n2. My friends are incredibly important to me, sometimes irrationally so. I\u2019m very picky about who I keep around or close to me, so if I approve of a friend they\u2019re a friend for life. \n3. My art & work. It\u2019s something I work hard on that I\u2019m proud of, it\u2019s also meaningful to me. \n4. Being valued in a dynamic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  What are your fears? \n\nI\u2019m afraid of being a bad person. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m a self absorbed prick, or that I make people feel bad, or that inherently at my core I\u2019m not a good person and I\u2019m masquerading my entire identity. Obviously it\u2019s not black and white like that, but it truly is something that eats away at me sometimes. To be fair, I suffer from confidence issues and anxiety so I worry about a lot of things. I over-analyze every single thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\n*  What makes you uncomfortable?\n\nI can\u2019t stand it when people have pre-conceived notions things about me out of nowhere. Especially if they try to push it on me when all they\u2019ve seen is a fraction of my life, they don\u2019t have the right to define or label me. I like knowing what people think of me light-heartedly, but when it leaks through that was what they genuinely thought of me it just. Ugh. It just rubs me the wrong way, you wouldn\u2019t catch me dead doing the same. Another thing I don\u2019t appreciate, when I set down a clear boundary and it isn\u2019t listened to even when I draw the line everytime. I\u2019m not your mother, I don\u2019t have to spell out every word for you. But honestly, I\u2019d distance myself before it even got to that point LMAO. I also find it weird when people feel *strongly* about certain things, just so blindly. Like \u201cI **hate** dogs\u201d, just an example but it\u2019s like? How can you make such a strong statement about something so general? Something that makes me panic, when people decide things too quickly without thoroughly looking through all the options fully to know which one will end up being the best possible option in the end. I will never get tunnel vision. Something that **actually** bothers me, when people take things others have confined to them and spill it to everyone else like it\u2019s their business. Even if you think it\u2019s not that deep, it was never *your* choice how deep it is to THEM, when your given information just assume they wouldn\u2019t want you to tell anyone unless CLEARLY proven otherwise. \n\n*  What do you hate?\n\nI hate arrogance, ignorance, closed mindedness, self-absorbed people, or just in general anyone who acts like the universe is centered around them and will listen to their every beck and call. I hate it when people speak sickly sweet words to you and speak ill of you behind your back with that same tongue. If you have a problem, you say it to my face. I hate being stifled, my voice being dismissed, not allowed to do what I want to do with *my* life. Having to live out someone else\u2019s expectation for me. I hate it when people walk past people suffering or in need of help but either don\u2019t see it worth their time or are afraid of what other people think. I hate it. I could go on, but I hate the cynical mindset it puts me in so I prefer to ignore all this exists in order to keep my hope in humanity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI\u2019d probably get bored or uncomfortable since I don\u2019t like sitting in my thoughts for too long due to my level of overthinking to the point I\u2019m constantly distracting myself with things so I\u2019m physically unable to, but I\u2019d explore my thoughts, memories, stories, and characters. And probably have a meltdown.   \n\n\n*  How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nForever. I was never really given control over my own life due to controlling parents, and I think that affects my decision making skills. I\u2019m completely unable to choose anything on my own unless I\u2019ve had the opinions of others and talked it through to truly figure out how I feel about it. Even then, the edge of my mind is always wondering if I even made the right decision in the end. I do obviously weigh the pros and cons and figure out what *feels* right to me, but I will doubt my choice no matter what. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI find myself not realizing how much something effected me until I suddenly process it randomly and it just.. *hits* me. And it crashes down on me. But after I realize it I\u2019ll start dissecting it in order to figure out why I felt that way and why it had such an effect on me. I think emotions r great, feel \u2018em, live \u2018em, leave \u2018em. I believe emotions should run their course because if they get bottled up they\u2019ll boil over much worse than before. And at that point it gets sticky because you can\u2019t control who you\u2019ll explode on, so it\u2019s better to understand them than hide them. It\u2019s called being \u2728healthy\u2728\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nMost of the time I\u2019ll politely disagree and explain my viewpoint, or even if I agree I\u2019ll point out another perspective on that same issue so we could have a nice open discussion. Although, if I\u2019m done with them & realize this conversation is going nowhere fruitful I\u2019ll try to end it there. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll get into a heated discussion with them and probably tarnish my image to them even if on my end I genuinely didn\u2019t care about it that much. The only time I catch myself agreeing just to agree is if it\u2019s someone I just met so I give them the benefit of the doubt, but if I feel *very* strongly about something I wouldn\u2019t blindly agree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nI don\u2019t believe rules should be broken often because they\u2019re there for a reason, but if you genuinely feel it goes against everything you stand for there\u2019s no point listening to it. If I broke a rule it\u2019d be for something that caused mine or someone\u2019s natural rights to be violated by these rules, authorities aren\u2019t perfect & can be corrupt and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d just let that slide just because of their position. I wouldn\u2019t be loud about breaking the law because I wouldn\u2019t want to face repercussions, but I\u2019d do it to protect or save someone even if it meant putting my life on the line in order to do so. I think in order for there to be a healthy system authorities *need* to be constantly questioned and challenged even if they\u2019re objectively right.   \n\n\n*  What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nHappy, healthy, making excellent bank, beautifully decorated cottage at the edge of the British isles with a forest in the back and a beach in the front. Adopted kids, married or single, feeling fulfilled in what I do or how I\u2019m living, a self-sustained garden, having family or friends near me, raising our kids together like siblings. Constantly traveling with my girl friends or spouse. Living idly and comfortably to its fullest.

{"submission": "She is my former middle school science teacher (and she has actually taught middle school science for a fair amount of time. I had her for seventh and eighth grade. \n\nI remember that she tended to specifically like hands-on activities in the classroom herself, and I think she once mentioned that this was the way she tended to learn things herself. I remember that my former best friend (ESFP?) disliked her, as she regarded this teacher as being too strict/not letting them having enough fun. A lot of the kids in my grade did not like her, but my grade was particularly toxic, so I\u2019m not sure that this actually matters a whole lot. I remember that my former best friend regarded her daughter as being a \u201cbrat,\u201d though I must note that my former best friend had said this in part because her daughter once shoved her, and that I don\u2019t have the impression that her daughter has turned out badly (she does strike me as being an involved parent. Interestingly enough, she was with her husband for about a year before they had their first child, and I don\u2019t have the impression that they have an unhealthy marriage.) She has two children, a daughter and a son, and does post them sometimes on her social media. I would say that she is average looking (not \u201cthin,\u201d but I would guess that this is moreso because she had two kids at a later age - she was born in 1971 - more than anything else. Her sister is overweight, so perhaps it\u2019s genetics as well. Her husband is overweight, too, and her children aren\u2019t \u201cthin.\u201d) \n\nCome to think of it, I actually seem to remember having the impression that this particular teacher did indeed notice the weight of others - when she met my mother (I get into that more below,) she was immediately judging her for being overweight, and I remember she once noted that someone was \u201cskinny\u201d in class (not a particular student, it\u2019s like a vague memory.) \n\nI was a teacher\u2019s assistant for one of my middle school teachers, and I recall that once my math teacher and a different staff member were having a conversation and one of them suggested that this teacher \u201ctalked\u201d to her, and said this like it was surprising (didn\u2019t say it sarcastically, exactly. She just kind of said it like this teacher was not/is not the type who actively makes an effort to befriend the other staff members - like she was or is the type that may keep more to herself.) This teacher later on suggested when I reached out to her years later that she was bullied when younger, and wants to be an \u201cadvocate\u201d for students who are being bullied. \n\nI mainly remember her now because she nominated me for an award/put my name in for a \u201cmost likely to succeed\u201d award\u2026 and when she met my parents, she read them correctly on the spot. It\u2019s like she knew they were bad people before I ever did. She was judging them as soon as they sat down - she mumbled \u201cew\u201d when my mother who is overweight sat down. She was still polite to them, but did not like them and I knew this. She mumbled \u201che did not turn out well\u201d when my mom mentioned that I have an older brother (my father is an unintelligent alcoholic who I do feel to be noticeably off. Neither of my parents said or did anything particularly abnormal, she just read both correctly, and quite literally did not like them as soon as they sat down.) She somehow understood that my parents weren\u2019t good parents, and I think she suspected my mom to be abusive (she once looked concerned when my mom came up to the school even though she still said hi when my mom said it. I had the impression she thought my mom was abusing me. My mother wasn\u2019t physically abusing me, but I have realized as I have grown older that my mom definitely has the potential to be abusive, and my mom actually has \u201chit\u201d my brother before.) At the time I just thought she was being judgmental, but about a year later my therapist called CPS due to my parents\u2019 failure to act when my brother (who is in rehab) did something gross, and I experienced particular trauma toward the end of eighth grade in part due to my parents\u2019 negligence, so she actually read them correctly. I remember that at one point, during this brief meeting, she briefly had a look on her face like she was wondering how I\u2019d turn out/whether or not I\u2019d turn out well (I think she wasn\u2019t sure.) \n\nShe had forgotten when I reached out about a year later that she had ever met them at all, though, and assumed that I have good parents (I do not have good parents.) \n\nI\u2019m not so sure that she read me correctly, though. I remember I actually owned a gossip account in middle school and cyberbullied many of my classmates (my classmates really did suck, though) but I don\u2019t think she read me well enough to understand that I was doing anything like that (I obviously am not like a sociopath or anything, I\u2019ll just admit that in middle school I was probably one of those people who thought myself to be kinder and more noble than I really was.) \n\nThis is a bio she wrote years ago: \u201cI\u2019ve taught 7th grade science since we first opened up our doors in 2010, but this is my 12th year teaching at this site, and my 17th year of teaching middle school. I initially went to college to become a doctor. I loaded up on science and math classes, but I went to university of Colorado and the mountains were calling to me. By the time graduation was coming up, I decided I needed to travel before I did anything else. I studied for six months in Costa Rica, I graduated, packed up and moved to *won\u2019t specify state* where I would save money and find somewhere else to go. After working and coaching and swimming for 5 years, I realized I enjoyed being around kids and helping them learn and improve upon new things WAY more than I liked working in an office. I went on to get my teaching credential and I\u2019ve been teaching middle school ever since.\u201d (I wrote in won\u2019t-specify-state. She did specify the state herself.) \n\nEven though she is an adult, I suspect that she did have an idea of which students in her class she felt were \u201csmart\u201d and which she felt weren\u2019t (or, well, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I just think that she had an idea.) She sometimes looks awkward in photos. She is active on social media a fair amount actually throughout the day, even if and when she isn\u2019t posting anything/posting pictures of her children. \n\nIn general, I get and always have gotten the impression that she is *somewhat* cynical, but I will note that I don\u2019t think she was someone who didn\u2019t care about children at all.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16dylk0)", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.121971406}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -2.5594714}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -4.7469716}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -4.8563466}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -5.0282216}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -5.2469716}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -6.2625966}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -7.0907216}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -7.1844716}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -7.2000966}, {"token": "Due", "logprob": -7.2157216}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -7.2313466}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -7.4032216}, {"token": "Without", "logprob": -7.6688466}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -7.8875966}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -8.246971}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -8.309471}, {"token": "Unfortunately", "logprob": -8.387596}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -8.512596}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -8.950096}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.0024854077}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -6.4243603}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -7.8462353}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -8.36186}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -8.76811}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -10.658735}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -11.033735}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -11.221235}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -12.42436}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -12.45561}, {"token": " available", "logprob": -12.596235}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -12.877485}, {"token": " details", "logprob": -13.20561}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -13.20561}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -13.439985}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -14.01811}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -14.096235}, {"token": " mentioned", "logprob": -14.14311}, {"token": " specific", "logprob": -14.20561}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -14.23686}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.046482127}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -3.140232}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -6.577732}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -7.687107}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -8.671482}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -10.218357}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -10.765232}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -11.093357}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -11.749607}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -11.843357}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -12.218357}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -12.327732}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -12.374607}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -12.483982}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -12.921482}, {"token": " about", "logprob": -13.499607}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -13.530857}, {"token": " hasn", "logprob": -13.702732}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -13.983982}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -14.015232}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -2.618001e-05}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -10.921901}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -13.500026}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -13.554713}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -13.820338}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -14.562526}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -14.609401}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -14.851588}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -15.375026}, {"token": " mention", "logprob": -15.500026}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -15.835963}, {"token": " reveal", "logprob": -16.031277}, {"token": " describe", "logprob": -16.117214}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -16.28909}, {"token": " include", "logprob": -16.304714}, {"token": " offer", "logprob": -16.312527}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -16.429714}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -16.609402}, {"token": " little", "logprob": -16.656277}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -16.66409}]}}
{"submission": "I'm fascinated by the Enneagram and I'm taking a look at MBTI and Socionics now. Before researching too much myself I would like to get some input. I hope it's okay that I'm using a questionnaire that I already filled out for the Socionics sub. As far as I can tell the questions aren't too different.\n\n**Section 1**\n\n*How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?*\n\nWorking is a difficult subject to me. I used to have different jobs (at a bank, as a nurse, in a laboratory), but I usually immedietely felt that this is not it. So I did it for sometimes just days, sometimes a couple months if it was bearable. Now I deliver newspapers at night and highly enjoy that. I work alone, can listen to music/podcasts and just be in my zone. I'm going to start a job working with addicts soon though. That's part of my university degree. My goal for the future is to be self-employed and I'm currently taking the steps to achieve that. I want to be my own boss since most of them fail to be human. Basically our whole system fails to be human and while it's interesting to observe and understand I don't want to be sucked in. I prefer staying alive, most people seem to die more and more as they work those tortured 8 hours a day. I don't mind effort if it's on my own terms or if it's demanded with heart.\n\n*How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?*\n\nThe highest quality fully resonates and comes from an inner place. Force and necessity are part of this world, but they lack the \"holy\" aspect of things that come right from your soul.\n\n*If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?*\n\nI guess I research or ask someone? It depends. Yes, I usually know if I'm better or worse than other people.\n\n*How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?*\n\nAgain: success comes from resonation and an inner place. It's about whatever rises from your soul when you are still or in a flow.\n\n**Section 2**\n\n*What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?*\n\nI usually get a feeling about a whole which would basically be a sum up of a situation or an end of a situation. Yesterday my best friend texted me that she felt sad. I immediately envisioned her sitting in her bed, depressed. L\u00f6st in darkness. Leaving her university. She is undergoing a transformation process at the moment. She is trying to find her own way. Today she texted me that she just had issues with her hormones, but I know what's going on and I'm pretty sure about it. I wouldn't fight about it and I'm open to being wrong, but I'm probably not. So I would say that there is usually a main thing about a whole situation and it's important to put attention to that.\n\n*What does \"logical\" mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?*\n\nIn my personal experience people often use the term \"logical\" to basically shit on anything that's based on emotions or any higher truth. I don't care about logic, I care more about being open to being wrong. In the past I used to be sure of things based on pretty much nothing. That included the weirdest spiritual believes. I experienced that the openness to being wrong made me much wiser. So I'm trying to keep that in mind. Other than that I believe that our intuition and our body tells us what's right. Feelings and thoughts can be a part of that, but they can be deceiving.\n\n*What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.*\n\nHierachies are used to keep people small. Like a boss treating his little slaves like bots. In an ideal world hierachies would be used to split respobsibilities (and getting paid according to that) while still treating everyone like a human being. The worst hierachie in this world is the 0,1% of the rich and powerful. They want us to be dumb slaves and they want more money and power. It's obvious how they are trying to achieve that through literally any system that we have. It makes me feel sick. They make us fight with each other instead of fighting them. They suck the life out of living.\n\n*What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.*\n\nThings having a natural order and naturally being in the same class. Like when I sort my clothes. Some shirts are for going out, some for lazy sundays and some are for very specific situations.\n\n*Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others' ideas?*\n\nI know my ideas are consistent if I follow my intuition. They at the very least are a necessary part of a bigger development then. If I follow what others want I begin to live in chaos. Sadly I'm a huge people pleaser, but I'm working on it.\n\n**Section 3**\n\n*Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?*\n\nI can and I (rarely) have, but there is no point. Anything that doesn't come from within is pretty much worthless.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I have used emotional manipulation in the past. I'm a good liar and I'm good at making myself appear like the sweetest, nicest and also the most helpless person you've met. That combination is extremely powerful.\n\n*How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?*\n\nIf I want something I try to get it. Weird question. I don't use others to get what I want if that's what's trying to be figured out here.", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.3124166}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -2.2030416}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -2.3124166}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -4.0155416}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -4.3124166}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -4.6561666}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -5.7499166}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -6.2186666}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -6.4842916}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -6.4842916}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -6.6249166}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -6.8905416}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -6.9374166}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.9530416}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -7.3124166}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -7.3280416}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -7.3436666}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -7.4061666}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -7.5467916}, {"token": "Due", "logprob": -7.8749166}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.0016952958}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -6.98607}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -7.626695}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -9.095446}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -9.329821}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -10.329821}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -10.782946}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -11.251696}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -12.032946}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -13.251696}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -13.704821}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -13.845446}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -14.173571}, {"token": " available", "logprob": -14.314196}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -14.470446}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -14.907946}, {"token": " mentioned", "logprob": -15.220446}, {"token": " specific", "logprob": -15.314196}, {"token": " textual", "logprob": -15.439196}, {"token": " details", "logprob": -15.439196}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.04250394}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -3.2143788}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -6.886254}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -8.401879}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -9.167504}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -10.605004}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -11.011254}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -11.558129}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -12.370629}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -12.370629}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -12.573754}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -12.855004}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -13.058129}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -13.151879}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -13.323754}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -13.480004}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -13.964379}, {"token": " in", "logprob": -14.386254}, {"token": " doesnt", "logprob": -14.417504}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -14.511254}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -1.504853e-06}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -14.187502}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -14.875002}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -15.828127}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -16.000002}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -17.156252}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -17.343752}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -17.64844}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -18.24219}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -18.52344}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -18.609377}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -18.703127}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -18.74219}, {"token": " have", "logprob": -18.984377}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -19.093752}, {"token": " indicate", "logprob": -19.265627}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -19.36719}, {"token": " include", "logprob": -19.390627}, {"token": " specify", "logprob": -19.406252}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -19.80469}]}}

{"submission": " I would be more than happy to explain any further for those who have any questions :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?** \n\nYes, I grew up in the Mormon church, and even though I liked and complied with it as a child, It just wasn\u2019t really the place for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m a Barista and I like it for the most part, The problem I have with it at the moment is mostly management and the lack of leadership and accountability for anyone involved it\u2019s genuinely just such an annoyance.\n\n1. **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nRealistically, more like a mix of Anxiety and refreshing, especially if there\u2019s just anything out of the norm.\n\n1. **What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI like drawing, writing, outlining, and then like yeah board games with the family or online. I\u2019ve never described myself as being good at sports, nor do I enjoy them, I like the idea of playing baseball but again it\u2019s just the idea. The only outdoor activities I remember doing and enjoying as a kid were mostly fishing and camping but other than that nah.\n\n1. **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nMost of my \u201ccuriosities\u201d seem to be either linked to studies within the humanities and the social sciences, so things like Politics, History, Economics, Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, etc. I don't think I have too many ideas than I can execute, however, some ideas will definitely take a lot longer to draft out and genuinely create more than others, not only that but like for a book it will take even longer with editors and publishers and whatever other nonsense that I\u2019d have to deal with. I would say most of my ideas in nature are much more conceptual, Again most of them are Ideas but to use a basic example from my liberal arts class, I used Carl Jung\u2019s work when It comes to the collective unconscious to find universal symbols or justice and moral acts of what we nowadays would consider being good vs evil. \n\n1. **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI would never admit it but I think I would absolutely enjoy being in some sort of leadership position, I think It would fulfill some of my control freak thoughts. I can only hope to be good at it but I think I would be competent enough. I want to say Tough but fair, I want things to run as effectively and as correctly as possible but I\u2019m fully aware that some ideas and things are blatantly ridiculous, and if someone doesn\u2019t want to comply they shouldn\u2019t have to, as long as justifiable reasons as to why.\n\n1. **Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nNo, it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve never been too good at, I suck at throwing, I suck at catching, and I can just be too in my head sometimes to actually be aware of my surroundings at all times. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy working with my hands either.\n\n1. **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nYes, I would describe myself as artistic/creative, the type of art I make would definitely depend on the medium that I am using, like for the rare times that I paint I do so with the idea of making abstract patterns and ideas, when sketching or drawing digitally its more to create a basic idea and concept of a character for a book in my own style based in Japanese games like persona and other different kinds of styles as well.\n\n1. **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nPast**:** I Have regrets and things I wish I could've done better but there's no point in wallowing in them\n\nPresent**:** I try my best to be in the present moment but it escapes me, I zone out a lot\n\nFuture**:** where my head likes to be at the most, pondering ideas about politics, personal life and their consequences, fun, almost existential stuff like that :)\n\n1. **How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\ndepends On what it is, if it's an emotional or psychological problem i almost immediately jump right into action and help those in need, if it's something like helping move the couches or other \"physical\" activity then I'll likely roll my eyes but still help anyways, but bitch about it before, during, and after.\n\n1. **Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI don't think its that important to me but it's nice to have nonetheless. \n\n1. **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI Would like to be more productive and more efficient, in my life, I think It would help immensely.\n\n1. **Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI Don't really like telling people what to do, i think people are perfectly capable of figuring stuff out on their own but if i have to i will say something \n\n1. **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nmbti, Writing, drawing, learning. Why do I like them? Because their interesting and enjoyable, these activities help stimulate my brain.\n\n1. **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nMy learning style is mostly auditory, I enjoy listening to lectures, podcasts, stories, and those stuff. I would say I struggle most with the kinaesthetic learning, idk just being dropped into something and expected to understand what to do is kind of ridiculous to me and that's also the reason I prefer audio learning it's much more convenient. I prefer both logical and creative classes\n\n1. **How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI would say yes? Personally, I have no real problems with breaking up projects to make them easier to manage, I can also wing it though if i do you should expect not the best results.\n\n1. **What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nProfessionally: I\u2019m still trying to figure that out about myself all I know is that I want to be able to build something important, and make enough to support myself and any family I might want in the future.\n\nPersonally: I want to be satisfied, I want to be full of something I want to pursue meaning.\n\n1. **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nFears: purposelessness, emptiness, being unlovable, dying alone, all that fun stuff :)\n\nUncomfortable: confrontation, talking about myself, touching, PDA, \n\nHate: politics, corruption, hookup culture, government, incompetence, lies, inaction, war, ignorance, hedonism, you get the point.\n\nWhy?: I don\u2019t know, it seems as though Hedonism is the common culture of today, Maybe it\u2019s just in the States, but it feels as though I can\u2019t relate to anyone anymore, It all seems like today's culture is driven by some sort of cult of sex, money, and luxury goods you can\u2019t afford. It seems like everything is spoon-fed to us by the corrupt elites at the top, to make our lives miserable enough that you go to indulge in every impulse you have just to make the pain go away. I don\u2019t really know though It\u2019s just easy to get angry when you see the potential for how much better things could be. I just dislike the way things are run in my country and I\u2019d like it to be better lol.\n\n1. **What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?** \n\nDefine a High. No seriously  I really can\u2019t recall I\u2019m sure I've had some, it just difficult to remember since I\u2019m going through a stressful moment in my life. I want to say middle school? It was just a better time, I had a good group, I did well in classes, I argued with some kid in the cafeteria about the 2016 election, and it was overall a good time.\n\n1. **What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nI think it\u2019d look something like this; It's 3 a.m. and I\u2019m contemplating whether or not I\u2019ve made the right choices and stressing about what comes after, thinking about certain responsibilities I have that I wish I could get rid of, thinking about projects that need to be turned in, that kind of stuff.\n\n1. **How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nYes, I would describe myself as an active daydreamer, I think I tend to hide it well enough for people to still be convinced that I\u2019m present in any given conversation though. I would say yes and no, I do my best thinking while I\u2019m walking, There have been times when I\u2019ve tripped and almost got hit by cars, however, it\u2019s not that common. \n\n1. **Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nIn all honesty, I\u2019d probably start to talk to myself, I\u2019m not crazy, I just like to think out loud. I\u2019d likely think of the same things i always tend to think about, government, politics, philosophy, books, my own stories, themes, ideas, movies, and video games. I just have a strong interest in social studies and liberal arts.\n\n1. **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nIt takes me a minute, I not allowed to make mistakes. I have to make sure that my head, heart, and my natural abilities are aligned before I make a decision. I hate the feeling of doubt, but yes it may take a few weeks those thoughts nibble at the brain, of how much easier it would be if I went down this other path instead and I hate it. \n\n1. **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nAs a child, I was very emotional and slowly with age I began to grow out of all the crying up until middle school where I began to push them down a little bit and would continue to do so until I realized that I didn\u2019t really feel anymore, and as of lately I\u2019ve been doing better at understanding myself and these repressed emotions that I've been hiding from myself. I feel as though I\u2019m a better person than I used to be.\n\n1. **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nYes, but not to keep the conversation going but to make the conversation stop. If not for that reason then I agree because I want to hear more of what their brain has to offer and how deep they keep going.

{"submission": "Hello, I\u2019ve been trying to find my type for a very long time, thought I might need some help, I\u2019ll be answering some of the questions (might do more if I\u2019m still not sure) from the guidelines.\n\n1.If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n-Probably refreshed, best if I have a book to read or something to research on my phone, although might feel bit lonely if remained in this state for too long (let\u2019s say a month)\n\n2.Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n- No, being the leader gives me the pressure to be perfect. Lot of times in group projects I see how the group can improve or perform better but I don\u2019t voice my opinions much. \n-Again I won\u2019t be a good leader, although others might think I am. \n-My leadership style will be redoing everything. I enjoy doing things myself so won\u2019t ask others to do a lot.\n\n3.What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n-Past: I\u2019d say I have a good long term memory, but I mostly remember my mistakes. I sometimes refer past events to present situations, like \u201cWhat does this remind me of?\u201d? Generally not enjoyable.\n-Present: I often have my head in the clouds, I do try to \u201cinsert\u201d myself into the present but end up tripping or bumping into things.\n-Future: I can\u2019t say I\u2019m future oriented, but I do see myself planning for it. I often think people are too present oriented or unrealistic about the future. I also see the consequences for my actions\n\n4.How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n- I have a hard time saying \u201cNo\u201d because I don't want to be seen as selfish. Sometimes I do like helping others as I want to be liked more than hated, and I like seeing them being successful from my help. Generally a passive helper.\n\n5.What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n-My biggest fears are complete darkness and the feeling of being useless (or seen as useless).\n-Loud noises, crowds and prolonged eye contact make me uncomfortable.\n-I dislike being told what to do because it feels like losing independence. I also dislike being asked too many questions as they drive my mind crazy.\n\n6.Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n-First thoughts would be: Where am I? Why am I here? How do I get out?\n-Afterwards I would start imagine fake scenarios like a ghost entering the room creating a portal for me to leave this room or start thinking about what would happen if I was stuck in it forever.\n\nThat's all, hope someone has an idea of my type (Apologies for any grammar mistakes)", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.7001717}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -1.2939217}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -2.8251717}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -3.1532967}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -3.5126717}, {"token": "Vir", "logprob": -3.7001717}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -3.7157967}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -4.3564215}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -4.6845465}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -4.8407965}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.3720465}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -5.9501715}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -6.2782965}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -6.6532965}, {"token": "Unc", "logprob": -6.7470465}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -6.9189215}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -6.9345465}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.9970465}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -7.3095465}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -7.5751715}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.0028507598}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -6.6903505}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -7.4403505}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -7.4403505}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -8.721601}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -9.299726}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -9.315351}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -10.674726}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -10.752851}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -11.440351}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -11.690351}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -12.565351}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -13.174726}, {"token": " mentioned", "logprob": -13.205976}, {"token": " details", "logprob": -13.471601}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -13.518476}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -13.830976}, {"token": " described", "logprob": -13.846601}, {"token": " individual", "logprob": -13.909101}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -13.955976}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.043457337}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -3.4497073}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -4.7934575}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -6.4340825}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -7.3247075}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -9.527832}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -10.184082}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -10.637207}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -11.215332}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -11.512207}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -11.684082}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -11.746582}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -12.012207}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -12.387207}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -12.699707}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -12.730957}, {"token": " mentions", "logprob": -12.840332}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -12.902832}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -13.012207}, {"token": " seems", "logprob": -13.527832}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -4.8425554e-06}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -12.843755}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -14.468755}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -14.843755}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -14.968755}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -15.289067}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -16.156256}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -16.562506}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -16.898443}, {"token": " mention", "logprob": -17.023443}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -17.04688}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -17.20313}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -17.468756}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -17.539068}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -17.585943}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -17.617193}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -17.875006}, {"token": " specify", "logprob": -17.992193}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -18.132818}, {"token": " reveal", "logprob": -18.320318}]}}

{"submission": "First, some backround:\n\nI have recently began to doubt initial thoughts about my type. I considered myself an INFP for the longest time, pretty much since I first began to take MBTI more seriously. I started out with 16personalities which was always extremely confused and couldn't help but switch between INFP and INFJ so I started looking deeper, learned cognitive functions etc. but it hasn't helped me figure out my type. My best guesses would be INFP, INFJ and INTP, INTJ in no particular order. I am still relatively a noob at this, so I can't say that they are accurate but I provide them anyway and will go into more detail about why I have entertained the thought of being all of them at certain points.\n\nThe reasons for my confusion:\n\nI took a multitude of tests, all of which type me as an INFP with two very significant exceptions that typed my as INFJ. Truity (which I know isn't very reliable, so I just passed it over originally) but Sakinorva then also had the same results consistently (I took it multiple times). This basically was what made me begin to have doubts. But then I made other observations in my life (which I will talk about below) that made me begin to doubt whether I'm a thinker. I fear that I may have taken the tests with an unconcious bias and answered in order to \"fool\" the test that I am an INFP because various important people that I admire were INFPs, such as J.R.R Tolkien. Or at the very least a feeler type, because of the same reason.\n\nMy personality traits:\n\nI am very interested in art. Music particularly since it is the only one I am competant in but also other forms of art such as painting, film, literature, poetry etc. I do consider myself an iNtuitive because, except for an edgy phase, I've cared much for symbolism and abstract concepts. I like to ask questions that are extremely theoretical and utterly impractical (ex: If all humans gathered together really closely and jumped, would our collective mass be enough to move the earth?) I also don't consider myself a Sensor since I have no particular affinity with tools, I am clumsy and quite often disoriented. I find theory a lot easier compared to practice and often feel I lack the afformentioned practical capabilities required to make use of theoretical knowledge. I take criticism very personally and emotionally. I have even cried when presented with criticism about me that was personal, and I strive to never allow anyone to critique me. I do this by ensuring that I am harshest to myself in order to meet the standards of the world with more ease. I doubt my self a lot, though I think that is evident, and often compare myself to others. I am very insecure and competitive. I quite frankly despise my urge to compete with others, hate myself for not measuring up etc. I know that those impulses are unsound.  I am mentioning them as think they could help somewhere in the typing but I digress. I was convinsed that I had Ne aux but then again Sakinorva argues for Ni dom so I'd love some clarification on the matter. Furthermore, although it isn't cognitive functions and thus likely irrelevant I still want to mention it: I read that INFJs are more orderly whereas INFPs are spontainious generally. I place great value in traditional values, customs, ideals etc. and the organizations that are as a guide to life from the past. This would point to me being INFJ according to that standard. However, I despise to-do lists, put off doing work with a deadline until the very last days before its end etc. If viewed in isolation, those traits would make me an INFP This is probably cause for much of the confusion as they might seem contradictory.\n\nFeeling vs Thinking\n\nUsually, and the reason I considered myself a feeler for a long time is that I greatly value morals. The same traditional outlook I usually have applies here. And yet I often find myself arguing for the side of \"reason\" and \"logic\" against idealism. I too would love if the world was perfect, there was no corruption, no poverty, no wars, all was in harmony but I understand that such a dream is unattainable and even an aproximation of it requires a lot of individual effort. Then there is my view on reality as being something fundementaly... real. Unchanging; there are certain laws in the universe which cannot be remade and those are the logical, factual things which we observe. \"I feel that...\" is not a valid arguement to me. \"The right thing to do is...\" is however valid to me, and I enjoy moral problems. I can provide emotional support and solutions to problems when I see another is troubled, however I tend to offer the latter more commonly and I appreciate when it is offered to me. I can be viewed as cruel, judging, and cold (most of all, to myself) and I may not like it that way but I have to admit that it is needed in many situations. This might just have to do with the fact that I am a man, and gender does play a part in this, but I am very intereded to see what it means from the perspective of the cognitive functions. What I want to know is: Is this Ti dom and my Fe inferior function makes my feel that I am unnaturally uncaring? Maybe Te inferior backlash against Fi? Is it perhaps that I am an Ni dom as Sakinorva suggests and these are just the auxilary and tertiary functions? This is my largest concern and any insight is greatly valued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStereotypes:\n\nI am neither a hippie nor a rebel so the infp stereotype doesn't work. I do work, I can be extremely productive and I don't have a problem with finding determination to get down and be productive. I only get anxious in stressful situations, time pressure and competition make me uncomfortable and often put myself in bad positions with deadlines (but never fail to meet them!) so the INTP stereotype also doesn't fit me. I am not a \"rationalist\" and no longer concerned only with empirical evidence to prove everything but I still see them as critical to problem solving. I am a christian, but not just for the Rousseau-ian emotional aspect of it and belonging and the traditions but also the rational arguements behind it, such as those made by Descartes and Kant. I doubt the notion that being religious has anything to do with being a thinker or a feeler, more to do with intuition. Thus, the stereotype of INTP's being anti-religion is also not applicable. I believe in biology, physics, mathematics etc. of course, and although I find them rather dull and not to my tastes (I prefer to understand humans by art, history, literature etc.) they are our tools for understanding the world around us, which ought to be understood. I consider this a nuanced opinion which doesn't particularly feel fitting to categorize within any of the stereotypes. (Feelers arguing that something is real because they want it to be real or thinkers arguing that nothing can be real unless proven with data). This section about stereotypes is an \"excuse\" if you will, to present some more information about myself but through the lens of mbti rather than plain real life examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the idea for each type:\n\nINFP: Most tests say so, I believe that I have Ne-Si, I have a strong sense of morality and values etc.\n\nINFJ: Things of INFP apply, but trusted tests say so and I am not that uncomfortable with hierarchy or routine (even though I do not enjoy the latter).\n\nINTP: I commonly support positions that have to do with logically resolving issues. You could say that I am a \"facts don't care about your feelings\" guy, but I personally still care about feelings which is why I am not sure about either INFP or INTP as I see some of myself in both. Still true if Ne-Si guesses are right.\n\nINTJ: If indeed I have lied subconciously to the tests hoping to be a feeler type and the results are INFJ, then the conclusion is that I am an INTJ. If I indeed am Ni dom, it simply switches the auxiliary and tertiary functions so really not too big of a deal.\n\nIn fine, I came here in order to resolve my doubts as to my type once and for all. I have provided some information (if it is insufficient please feel free to ask more things), some of my observations about myself and some thoughts, reasons I doubt test results and my own typing by functions, how I don't fit within the stereotypical view of any category in full. Any and all help in figuring this out is appreciated. Sorry for the long read and thank you for your time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S If the flair is wrong, tell me please. I have never posted here. \n\n&#x200B;", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -8.6497064e-05}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -10.515712}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -10.843837}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -11.078212}, {"token": "Text", "logprob": -12.265712}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -12.328212}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -12.515712}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -12.531337}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -13.312587}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -13.421962}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -14.109462}, {"token": "Ap", "logprob": -14.468837}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -14.546962}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -14.718837}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -14.890712}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -15.046962}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -15.343837}, {"token": "Unfortunately", "logprob": -15.437587}, {"token": "Sorry", "logprob": -15.500087}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -15.625087}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -2.8160932e-06}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -13.312503}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -14.687503}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -15.031253}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -15.500003}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -16.687502}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -16.937502}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -17.187502}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -18.093752}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -18.343752}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -19.359377}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -19.859377}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -21.000002}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -21.796877}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -22.218752}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -22.375002}, {"token": " story", "logprob": -23.234377}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -23.312502}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -23.312502}, {"token": " hor", "logprob": -23.421877}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.017753722}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -4.7365036}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -4.7365036}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -10.205254}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -11.470879}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -12.330254}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -13.236504}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -13.392754}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -13.549004}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -14.939629}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -14.955254}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -15.033379}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -15.299004}, {"token": " makes", "logprob": -16.064629}, {"token": " includes", "logprob": -16.408379}, {"token": " you", "logprob": -16.674004}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -16.814629}, {"token": ",", "logprob": -16.908379}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -17.002129}, {"token": " in", "logprob": -17.049004}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -1.9361265e-07}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -16.140625}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -17.5}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -17.59375}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -17.734375}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -18.0625}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -18.625}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -19.773438}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -19.773438}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -19.859375}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -20.273438}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -20.382812}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -20.398438}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -20.421875}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -20.71875}, {"token": "nt", "logprob": -20.789062}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -20.859375}, {"token": " now", "logprob": -21.0625}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -21.328125}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -21.429688}]}}

{"submission": "When I was a teenager, I used to have this 'frenemy' that would constantly follow me around, eavesdrop on conversations I had in order to reference things I said and bond with me through that, and SMS/call me nonstop during our last year of school together. During that time in my youth, I was an aggressively mentally ill, nihilistic loner (unhealthy enneagram 5 alert), so I initially dismissed his offers at closeness as thinly-veiled attempts to mock me behind my back with his buddies because of his overt fuckboy personality and bourgeois lifestyle/demeanour. I even insulted his intelligence in such a crass manner so much that his responses to my badgering went from passive-aggressive teasing to straight-up impulsive angry jabs at my repulsive attitude and appearance. However, looking back on it now, I can see that all of the things he\u2019s done for me were attempts at comforting me and trying to help me become a part of the group as a result of him being extremely sensitive to the predicaments of my debilitating neurological impairments.\n\nI always thought that he was an obvious ESTP since he mostly thought about materialistic things (golfing, his status in society, appearance) and always enjoyed living in the present moment (partying, being shamelessly kinky/horny) whilst getting frustrated at me for overthinking things instead of taking action. He also would devote a significant amount of our arguments to bluntly criticising how I chose to present myself to others through immensely detailed similes, as though implying that my behaviour was so 'ugly and nasty' that it reminded him of a spooky spider that creeps and crawls underneath one\u2019s desk, and that I\u2019d never succeed in life acting like that. On the other hand, during those arguments, he\u2019d also make these ominous predictions about my future that ended up being eerily accurate to how my life ended up turning out, which I would acknowledge in the back of my head but was too delusional in my image to confront head-on. This makes me consider that his Ni is higher in his function stack than I was initially led to believe, especially when one takes into account that he was 16-19 years old when he had these premonitions about me.

{"submission": "i have tried different online tests and every time i do them i get a different result so i genuinely have no idea what i am because i somewhat relate to every type... so pls help based on my answers from the questions in the pinned post, many thanks to anyone reading this personal reflective essay\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\ni am 21, female, i can speak 4 languages (cantonese, english, japanese, mandarin chinese), and i'm now studying in japan.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\ni used to suffer from depression and had antidepressants from 2019\\\\\\~2021, but i'm now completely off meds and am not seeing a therapist (so that means clinically i'm recovered); also got a diagnosis for asd but it's like very borderline so i don't think it matters much\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\ni'm born and raised in hong kong with a brother who is 5 years younger than me, so it's your typical asian parents and education things, and my family isn't religious nor we actively participate in any religious heavy traditions (except the traditional chinese new year etc). my parents had high expectations on my academic performance and wanted me to receive \"better\" education that i was sent to a private school, but my dad passed away when i was 11 that kinda crushed the family for a while but it's a happy family in general. oh and i have moved houses for \\\\\\~8 times my whole life too.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\ni'm still a student but i have worked part time jobs in tutorial centres (that also serve as a childcare centre), now i'm in japan i just work in a sushi shop's kitchen. i have pretty much enjoyed most of them, as i wouldn't have accepted the offers if i didn't like them in the first place.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\ni mean i now live alone and i'm already spending weekends all by myself, so honestly it's quite nothing, it's like breathing air, i don't necessarily feel either lonely or refreshed, it's just... a part of my life now yknow?\n\n\u2022  What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\ni prefer indoor activities and i do not like sports at all, sweating stinks eww, well but if it's sports that can be done indoors i don't really mind them like going to the gym or doing yoga at home, but they aren't really something that i would actively do on a regular basis. i usually just spend my free time watching youtube or anime or just be on my phone/computer, and i can sit in front of a pc all day.\n\n\u2022  How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it  environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nit really depends if i am interested in that particular topic, if i find myself interested i can go on with discovering that topic for a long time (months or sometimes years). and usually my ideas are stemmed from something existing - so for example i'm watching a video on youtube then i would think how can i create something similar to this but in my style? what even is my style like? so a lot of times i really feel like creating a youtube channel to execute all these ideas but thing is i literally want to do so many things that my channel would probably just be a whole mess of pretty much everything, for example i once bought a microphone cuz i wanted to record covers of my favourite songs (but i never liked how the videos turned out to be, mostly cuz how much i dislike my outlook), and i once bought a camera because i wanted a vlog a trip (but end up breaking it in the middle of the trip), and also i tried uploading english translation of some japanese videos but they took a lot of time and energy to create that i did like 3 and gave up. there was also a phase that i was into online novels then i tried writing my own, but then i ran out of ideas that i literally didn't know how to end my story so i gave up halfway lol \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\ni used to be active in these kind of situations and would fight for every single chance to be a leader, but after actually being one in high school by leading a whole school club, i decided not to touch this position anymore because i realized that how unfitting of a leader i was. however, in a lot of social situations, i just felt like i had to be in this position because no one wants to do, but it's not like i want to be one either. my leadership experience had been criticized as \"demanding\" and \"expecting everyone to follow exactly what i say\", which was true because i got really mad when i expected people to hand in something that they are supposed to do but they did not at all and decided to do other things instead.\n\n\u2022  Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nmaybe yes, i follow instructions pretty well and i think i deliver what people expected me to do most of the time. or sometimes i finish what i was told to do a little too fast that i may appear that i have nothing to do. and yes i like doing diy's, every piece of ikea bought furniture at my home is assembled by me and i handle most of the tech things around my social circle too, from dealing with wires to fixing their pc's.\n\n\u2022  Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\ni don't think any aspect of me can connect to the word artistic at all. i do not understand art nor i have an idea on what an artist thinks via their work. when i encounter \"what does the author really mean by ...\" type of questions in an exam my immediate thought is \"why am i supposed to know? ask the damn author on how they think\". even when i say i enjoy anime i don't really think about how this scene is expressed and what meaning or metaphor does this particular scene have behind it, i'm just here for the overall enjoyment.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\ni feel like someone's past shapes their personality at present, and i personally do not believe in the predictable future (like horoscopes or crystal ball things), and i believe that one's future is on their hands. in other words, i believe that a person shapes their own future. but if you're asking me how i feel about the objective past, present and future... honestly i don't really feel anything? in a macro scale, i very much agree with people saying that history repeats itself, and i don't really feel hopeful for the future as i don't really have much faith in the world we currently live in is going to be a better place.\n\n\u2022  How do you act when others request your help to do something  (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\ni would mostly try to offer help within my range, because i can't really think of a good reason to reject someone. i really hate when i have to turn down a request too because that's pretty much the only time that i feel somewhat important to others. sometimes i feel like i do a little bit too much that i look back i felt like i shouldn't be spending this much time on them, for example my friend was once struggling on which laptop to buy that he came to me for advice, then i typed out a whole google document of laptop comparison and gave him a whole lecture in that document on how to pick cpus etc, and that costed a whole night's sleep.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nvery much yes. i would freak out if something doesn't go in my expected range.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nyes, because of the environment i grew up in, everyone values efficiency and productivity. everyone acts very fast and doesn't have a lot of patience. for me, i am somewhat influenced by this kind of culture that sometimes when sometimes doesn't go efficiently i would ... not exactly freak out? but it certainly doesn't feel good at all. i guess \"worried\" is the closest word i can use to describe this feeling. and this applies to both mine and others' efficiency and productivity. although i am a heavy procrastinator as well, that as i am typing up this post, i actually have my math homework to be completed.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\ni have no idea how to do that. ok maybe when i used to suffer from depression and was suicical i probably did something similar to emotional blackmail to gain people's attention (which turned out to be a failed attempt as well), but i didn't even realize how much i hurt them until very recently. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nwatching anime, because ... idk it has become a habit for years now. it just feels familiar (probably because i know japanese) and a safe escape from reality. also listening to music, mostly japanese and english modern pop/rock music, because... again it feels familiar, and sometimes i relate myself to the lyrics especially in the rock sector. (it's mostly pop punk so yknow a little bit of rebellion things and a little bit of \"IDK WHAT IM DOING WITH MY LIFE\" things)\n\n\u2022  What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles?  Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or  your physical senses?\n\ni prefer learning things where i can get myself involved into it. so probably my physical senses, as they create a better concept in my head by actually experiencing them. unfortunately typical asian education is just asking you to memorize this and that and i have a small brain. and i struggle with morning classes because i just CANNOT stay awake until at like 11am. other than that i think i can learn pretty fast once i get the hang of the new things that i have to learn.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nyes i think i can pretty much break up big goals or projects into small tasks, because i myself need very extremely clear instructions in order to start doing something. but i allow some degree of changes as long as they are well discussed and proved to work better than the current plan. and please let me know when you have to make a change. PLEASE.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nhonestly i have no idea, i feel like my goals or aspirations change every 5 months. i have no idea what i really want to pursue in the future either, i just feel like i need to get a university degree because i have to or i can't find jobs, and i need a job in order to sustain my living or i will live on the streets, and other than that i can't really come up with anything that i really want to do. even if tomorrow is the end of the world, today i would probably just sit at my home and spend the last day of my life as usual. or im probably gonna go to a well receieved ramen shop to have my last bowl of ramen.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\ni mostly fear people? i don't like crowded spaces because i fear people will look at me thinking im some kind of weirdo; i also fear that people will betray me in the next second, i fear that people secretly find me annoying that they actually don't wanna hang out with me, and i fear that i don't meet others' expectation that i would lose what i currently have (for example, my job). i feel uncomfortable in crowded spaces (but public speaking is fine) (i think i have some kind of agrophobia but it's not like it's professionally diagnosed or anything), odd-number groups and/or being the odd one out. i hate people who refuse to listen to others' opinion, know-it-alls, conflicts with other people (but i get into them VERY easily for some reason), and also people who play dumb. so you see it's mostly people related and basically i hate people.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nwhen i got all the attention and compliments when i was a kid. then it just get worse as i grow up. if it means the high moments in my life then i guess i get super energetic and motivated that i can work nonstop without needing to eat or sleep, and also i become extremely talkative that i would even start to talk to myself, that now i have a plushie with me that acts as some kind of imaginary friend so i feel less lonely.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nprobably when i had depression, i felt like all my fears (mentioned above) are true, i felt paranoid that everyone secretly hates me, and it felt like i was screaming into a void. i was actively suicidal as well. if it's not something this low, then i just sometimes lose my motivation in doing everything and just lie on a sofa for the rest of the day mindlessly scrolling on my phone.\n\n\u2022  How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay  attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni daydream quite often, but most of the time its being lost in a train of thoughts and lose focus on my surroundings (which counts as daydreaming i guess?), and i think i'm like half aware that i'm daydreaming? it's like i got focused on my thoughts but at the same time i am aware that my focus is on them\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nprobably just lie down and stare at the ceiling for a while, and fall asleep eventually? depends on how long i'm in that room, if after i wake up i still can't go outside of that room then i would start to freak out and/or worry about a lot of things\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nit ranges from 1 second to forever. but once i made a decision i rarely change my mind on it.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\ni'd say they process relatively slower than an average person, for example when something really bad happens to me, my brain is mostly blank as an immediate response, then the emotions would hit like a few hours later or a few days later when everything is calmed down. for example i rarely cry when watching movies, but the emotions would hit at the night before i go to sleep.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nyes, especially if they're talking about something that i don't understand or i'm not interested in. i usually just nod along when people are making a statement even though i'm not fully listening.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nno, i follow the rules as long as they align with my morals. i feel like the authority is not absolute and is always up for challenges and possible changes, but i'm usually not the one to do so. most of the time i just complain privately but i'm too coward to speak against an authority.", "clean_guess": "Virgo", "llm_guess": "Virgo", "logprobs": {"Vir": [{"token": "Vir", "logprob": -0.22001362}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -2.5481386}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -2.6575136}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -3.8293886}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -4.3450136}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -5.6418886}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -5.6887636}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.8918886}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -6.0637636}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -7.6262636}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.7200136}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -7.7825136}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -8.048139}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -8.782514}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.454389}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -9.735639}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -9.751264}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -9.970014}, {"token": "Leo", "logprob": -10.141889}, {"token": "CAP", "logprob": -10.173139}], "go": [{"token": "go", "logprob": -1.2664457e-06}, {"token": "ago", "logprob": -14.765626}, {"token": "gos", "logprob": -15.250001}, {"token": "\u0433\u043e", "logprob": -15.914063}, {"token": "g", "logprob": -16.476564}, {"token": "GO", "logprob": -16.789064}, {"token": "goo", "logprob": -16.953127}, {"token": "gio", "logprob": -17.140627}, {"token": "Go", "logprob": -17.851564}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -17.921877}, {"token": "igo", "logprob": -18.203127}, {"token": "got", "logprob": -18.320314}, {"token": "gon", "logprob": -18.539064}, {"token": "geo", "logprob": -18.86719}, {"token": "_go", "logprob": -18.882814}, {"token": "co", "logprob": -18.890627}, {"token": "-go", "logprob": -18.890627}, {"token": " go", "logprob": -19.11719}, {"token": "ugo", "logprob": -19.156252}, {"token": "gov", "logprob": -19.218752}]}}
{"submission": "After research I narrowed down my main functions as Fe Ti Ne Si - ISFJ/ESFJ/INTP/ENTP, however I relate to them all. This is my full questionnaire, which of the 4 types do I sound most like?\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\-Probably refreshed, best with a book or phone, might feel a bit lonely staying in this state for too long (maybe a month)\n\nWhat is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\n\\-I trip and bump into things more often than others, not very aware of surroundings. I prefer indoor activities like watching movies or playing games rather than outdoor activities, but taking a walk on cloudy days sounds nice.\n\nHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\-I consider myself pretty curious, always asking \u201cWhy?\u201d and \u201cHow?\u201d. Usually when I see or hear something new, I do deep research on that topic. Sometimes my mind comes up with ideas of new projects and connections from things I\u2019ve seen, a lot of them cannot be executed.\n\nWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\-No, it gives me pressure of being perfect. Others may vote for me as leader, but I don\u2019t have much confidence and do not enjoy the job. My leadership style would be redoing everything as I find it hard to understand others\u2019 work.\n\nAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n\\-Lot of times no, I think much faster than I move, like speaking. I am the worst with my hands, even if someone shows me how to do something I cannot repeat it, but I like playing musical instruments.\n\nAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\-I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m good at drawing, I like doodling and creating something new. I\u2019m also good at drawing anime/cartoon characters. I very much appreciate music as a form of art, makes me imagine scenarios.\n\nWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\-Past: I have good long term visual memory, and I dwell on past mistakes. Sometimes I refer the past to the present, like \u201cWhat does this remind me of\u201d. Generally do not enjoy thinking of the past.\n\n\\-Present: I have lots of thoughts and often have my head in the cloud. Try to focus on the present but fail.\n\n\\-Future: I\u2019m not particularly future oriented, but am planning for it. Often telling others being too present focused. Can see consequences for my actions.\n\nHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\-I have a hard time saying \u201cno\u201d because I don\u2019t want to upset others and be seen as selfish. If I actively help someone it\u2019s either they are looking too helpless or I want to see them succeed on behalf of me. More of a verbal helper. \n\nDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\-Very much, I hate it when peoples\u2019 words don\u2019t add up (although I do this too as it\u2019s hard to explain my thinking process)\n\nHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\-It\u2019s important when I\u2019m in a rush to do something, but generally I prefer doing the right thing even if it takes a long time.\n\nDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\-Sometimes, to see how things turn out. I do this indirectly like controlling others using words and body gestures that seem normal.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\-I haven\u2019t found a \u201ccomfort hobby\u201d yet, but I do enjoy researching, reading and watching videos about topics I like. I like to be clear about things and want to know more about it.\n\nWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most?\n\n\\-I\u2019m a visual learner, also learn from self researching. I struggle with loud environments and group brainstorming.\n\nWhy do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\-I can\u2019t focus in loud environments, sometimes I don\u2019t get others\u2019 ideas in group brainstorming. I enjoy classes that involve creativity and can acquire knowledge, also like small competitions in classes.\n\nHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\-I ain\u2019t bad at improvising but strongly prefer having a plan. I find it a bit hard to break up projects into manageable tasks, I prefer doing things all in one go.\n\nWhat's important to you and why?\n\n\\-Having a unique set of mind is important as I want to prove to others I know better than them.\n\nWhat are your aspirations?\n\n\\-Archiving something that can change the world, like finding cure for illnesses considered untreatable.\n\nWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\-I\u2019m scared of darkness and being useless (or seen as useless), also my own imagination. Loud noises, crowds and getting too much attention makes me uncomfortable. I hate being asked too many questions and orders that make no sense.\n\nWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I become more passionate about things, I smile and talk more.\n\nWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\-I become a lot more quiet. I will see things negatively and may become critical of others and myself.\n\nHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\-I can\u2019t say I daydream but I am constantly thinking about things. People sometimes tell me to watch out or ask me if I\u2019m fine. However I am very realistic.\n\nImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\-First thoughts: Where am I? Why am I here? How to get out? \n\n\\-Then I would start imagining creepy things like a ghost trying to haunt me or I may think what would happen if I was stuck in there forever.\n\nHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\-I see both pros and cons when making a decision, I tend to make decisions fast but overthink if it really aligns with what I want, sometimes may change it.\n\nHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\-I don\u2019t express many extreme emotions and I\u2019m good at controlling them. I think people should learn self control too. However I do value my feelings.\n\nDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\-I sometimes do this with people I don\u2019t know well. However with my close ones, I almost never do that, I don\u2019t like agreeing to something that isn\u2019t right.\n\nDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n\\-I often find rules that can be improved but I can\u2019t be bothered so I just follow, and afterwards I may tell my close friends my opinion. However I may break the rules if I don\u2019t see myself getting a considerable result in a friendly game.\n\nWhat is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\n\\-An ideal life in my opinion means work harder when young, rest more when old. Allows alone and time when wanted, but also time for discussing matters with close friends. Strict routines not preferred. Allows listening to more music. Have a good hobby. Generally enjoyable to one\u2019s personal standards but also contributes to the society.\n\nDo I sound more like ENTP/INTP/ISFJ/ESFJ?( or another?)", "clean_guess": "Gemini", "llm_guess": "Gemini", "logprobs": {"Gem": [{"token": "Gem", "logprob": -0.1293674}, {"token": "Vir", "logprob": -2.7387424}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -3.7699924}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -4.4418674}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -4.8949924}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -5.2543674}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -5.4262424}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -6.4887424}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -6.8481174}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -7.5668674}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.6606174}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -7.8949924}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -8.426243}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -8.957493}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -9.238743}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.785618}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -10.098118}, {"token": "Leo", "logprob": -10.394993}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -10.410618}, {"token": "A", "logprob": -10.457493}], "ini": [{"token": "ini", "logprob": 0.0}, {"token": "ni", "logprob": -16.953125}, {"token": "Ini", "logprob": -17.96875}, {"token": "INI", "logprob": -18.421875}, {"token": "init", "logprob": -18.546875}, {"token": "ani", "logprob": -18.734375}, {"token": "ino", "logprob": -18.734375}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -18.921875}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -19.421875}, {"token": "imi", "logprob": -19.898438}, {"token": "iny", "logprob": -19.898438}, {"token": " ini", "logprob": -20.445312}, {"token": "inn", "logprob": -20.664062}, {"token": "ine", "logprob": -20.984375}, {"token": ".ini", "logprob": -21.257812}, {"token": ",", "logprob": -21.679688}, {"token": "mini", "logprob": -21.8125}, {"token": "ina", "logprob": -21.820312}, {"token": "_ini", "logprob": -22.015625}, {"token": "inis", "logprob": -22.03125}]}}

Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\ni grew up in a religious household and my parents often forced their ideologies onto me which really irritated me (and frankly was one of the root causes of my traumas) anyway i\u2019ve always disliked going to church for that reason but i just ended up going regularly anyways to maintain the peace between me and my parents\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)?

Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\ni desire to have structure in my life, so if the time calls for me to be a leader, i wouldnt mind taking on the role. i don\u2019t think i\u2019d be the best at it due to my anxiety but with practice and preparation i think i can be decent. my leadership style would be more on the relaxed side since i want my team members to have freedom in what they want to say and to express their opinions without judgement. i welcome an open discussion and constructive criticism as long as it helps with the vision of the project.  \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\ni would say yes. i practice a lot of facial expressions and body movement in the mirror to see which one looks the most natural and \u201cleast awkward\u201d to the human eye. i\u2019ve been doing this for years now so i can safely say my mind and body coordination is pretty well trained. i do enjoy working with my hands and body, since i am a student in a performing arts course, almost every class i have involves some form of physical activity.\n\n(continued in comments)", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.14607841}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -2.8023283}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -3.5210783}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -4.7398286}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -4.8960786}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.2085786}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -5.4117036}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -5.5054536}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -5.7085786}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -6.1460786}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -6.3804536}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -6.4117036}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -6.4585786}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.7398286}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -6.9898286}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -7.4117036}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -7.8648286}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -7.8960786}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -7.9898286}, {"token": "Due", "logprob": -8.021078}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.0016576861}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -6.8766575}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -7.7672825}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -9.3454075}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -9.8141575}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -10.2516575}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -11.7672825}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -12.1110325}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -12.9391575}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -13.3454075}, {"token": " available", "logprob": -13.5954075}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -13.5954075}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -14.0016575}, {"token": " details", "logprob": -14.3454075}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -14.7204075}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -14.7985325}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -15.0329075}, {"token": " textual", "logprob": -15.3141575}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -15.3610325}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -15.4079075}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.051415566}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -3.0201657}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -6.9576654}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -8.37954}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -9.56704}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -10.395165}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -11.34829}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -11.78579}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -12.69204}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -12.69204}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -12.926415}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -12.957665}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -12.97329}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -13.363915}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -13.520165}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -14.113915}, {"token": " hasn", "logprob": -14.957665}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -14.988915}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -15.020165}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -15.020165}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -4.365741e-06}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -13.35938}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -14.156255}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -14.45313}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -15.20313}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -15.32813}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -16.007816}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -16.679691}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -16.734379}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -16.937504}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -16.976566}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -17.093754}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -17.328129}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -17.445316}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -17.539066}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -17.687504}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -17.703129}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -17.750004}, {"token": " now", "logprob": -17.750004}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -17.843754}]}}

{"submission": "Hi! So I know I'm definitely a pessimist. Like I could be absolutely certain that nothing will go wrong unless I somehow die while doing something, but what I say to others is still just giving off a pessimistic prediction of what might happen.\n\nSometimes when I'm really happy with a situation, I start worrying about losing this happy place. Either fearing that I'm not good enough to hold my place in this happiness or just worried that something will come and take away the happy place, I start panicking and making efforts to keep the situation there, but usually end up the reason that the situation goes away and I'm unhappy again. Then when I do actually lose it, I turn into this vitriolic being which worsens the already unhappy matter.\n\nWhen I make a decision, I like to go into research on things, from days to a month. Yet when I do make the decision, I might change my mind. I quite like the feeling of doing extensive research so every crack and nook is made aware of. I feel nervous when I just jump head in without knowing anything.\n\nWhenever I find myself liking something, I start worrying that I might run out, and end up getting this whole stash. For example, I get this pen that I really like, but I can never just sit there enjoying this one pen. I need at least 2 because I'm concerned that I might lose one or the company that produces this pen shuts down and I can't buy a replacement.", "clean_guess": "Virgo", "llm_guess": "Virgo", "logprobs": {"Vir": [{"token": "Vir", "logprob": -0.005806379}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -6.0995564}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -6.2245564}, {"token": "T", "logprob": -7.0995564}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -7.3808064}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -9.474556}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -10.521431}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -11.896431}, {"token": "The", "logprob": -12.349556}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -13.771431}, {"token": " Vir", "logprob": -14.927681}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -15.458931}, {"token": "S", "logprob": -15.958931}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -16.380806}, {"token": "A", "logprob": -16.927681}, {"token": "V", "logprob": -16.943306}, {"token": "Leo", "logprob": -17.287056}, {"token": " Scor", "logprob": -17.896431}, {"token": "Virgin", "logprob": -17.990181}, {"token": "CAP", "logprob": -18.396431}], "go": [{"token": "go", "logprob": -9.0883464e-07}, {"token": "gos", "logprob": -15.296876}, {"token": "ago", "logprob": -15.468751}, {"token": "\u0433\u043e", "logprob": -16.1875}, {"token": "GO", "logprob": -16.875}, {"token": "g", "logprob": -17.15625}, {"token": "goo", "logprob": -17.617188}, {"token": "gio", "logprob": -17.820312}, {"token": "Go", "logprob": -18.15625}, {"token": "-go", "logprob": -18.21875}, {"token": "_go", "logprob": -18.734375}, {"token": " go", "logprob": -18.78125}, {"token": "co", "logprob": -18.8125}, {"token": "\n", "logprob": -18.828125}, {"token": "gon", "logprob": -18.851562}, {"token": "gov", "logprob": -19.046875}, {"token": "igo", "logprob": -19.101562}, {"token": "got", "logprob": -19.109375}, {"token": "geo", "logprob": -19.179688}, {"token": ".go", "logprob": -19.4375}]}}
{"submission": "I cant tell if im an ISFJ or an ESFJ. So please help me decide.\n\nSo I\u2019m 15F. I always view myself as this nostalgic person who really values her life. I really value the present because I know that I\u2019ll be able to make fond memories that I\u2019ll always be able to look back on. I view my life in an organised way id say - I have categorised my life in terms of different phases/stages of growth I\u2019ll be undergoing, such as primary (elementary/middle) school years, secondary (high) school years etc (fyi I\u2019m singaporean). I also love to do yearly reviews, because I love to look back on my growth and all the key moments that make the year unique. I always make it a sort of tradition to do yearly reviews. \n\nI also think that I plan my time in a rather rigid fashion. It\u2019s very hard for me to be flexible. So when a problem arises that forces me to change my plans, I get very frustrated. I also heavily determine the best methods to achieve success by looking at my past experiences (successes and failures). One example is when studying for school exams. I try to innovate when I find myself unable to find a proper study technique and want to figure out what works for me. If it helps me get a good grade, I continue with it. If i flunk a test because of it, I scrap that technique and find a new one (more like I watch study videos for tips haha). \n\nAdditionally, I really value what people say. Like, on a near-personal level. I constantly think about how people think of me, and how my actions could affect other people and their impressions of me. I am quite adept at reading body language of a person, and can tell nitty-gritty details about a person and their feelings (e.g just based on observation I can tell who my friends have a crush on). I also am conflict-averse and prefer to keep the peace with my friends. I am trying my best to not be so conflict averse due to past experience, but\u2026yeah, it\u2019s not something that\u2019ll go away that easily lmao.\n\nI also really try to make sense of the world around me. I need myself to explain why the world is the way it is, and I am not comfortable just accepting something just because it exists. An example is how I need to ponder why I/others don\u2019t like a particular book, and why a particular law/rule has been put into place. \n\nI also overthink. A lot. I jump to conclusions SO fast about people because of my insecurities and because of my own observations. I constantly think about \u201cwhat-if\u201ds about my friends - \u201cwhat if they are annoyed at me because I did _____ the other day?\u201d \u201cWhat if this person prefers person A over me?\u201d. Again my past experiences have made me try to control my imagination, but it\u2019s something that just happens sometimes. I also have a track record of being delusional. I remember I was in a pick me girl phase in middle school and constantly finding \u2018evidences\u2019 that a guy i had a crush on liked me.\n\nYeah. Please help \ud83d\ude4f if you need any more details, please feel free to ask.

{"submission": " \u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? \n\n\\- I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD. Or maybe my attention span is really fucked. I cannot sit still unless I am deeply involved in a task and I easily lose interest in things.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\n\\- Grew up in a strongly religious background. Always complied with it but secretly never enjoyed it much. I always was against it but just went along with it. \n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n\\- I currently study medicine at university. It is tough, tougher than anything I've studied so far in my life, but I like it. It is very interesting. The body is quite intricate and quite amazing in the way it works.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\- It would depend on many factors. I would feel lonely though.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n\\- I'm not good at any sports, but I lift and run outside. Otherwise I greatly prefer reading or gaming.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- I don't like being in leadership positions. I actively try to avoid those. That is because I suck at managing people and at planning team jobs. I prefer working by myself. If I were to be a leader however I believe I would be a control freak that is too afraid to be too hard on his subordinates.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\- I am quite not in touch with my past. I never regret anything I do since I cannot change it and my past barely bothers me. I in fact have bad memory and I tend to forget things easily. I would love to have an opinion on the present but I seldom live in it. I usually prefer dwelling inside my head rather than experiencing the present. But whenever I get back to reality I believe I do enjoy my present somewhat or maybe I actively try to escape it. \n\nHowever, if by present the question meant the \"present\" as for everyone right now, I think that the present is quite alright. It is as regular as it has been any other time in history. People are dying right now because of disease or other people as they have always done. I simply just move forward. \n\nThe future is uncertain. I tend to fantasise about the future. Near future and far future. But in general I have a positive outlook of it. I cannot say anything for sure about it.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\- I usually help others because I want to be seen as useful and because I want people to like me. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\- Yes. I do believe I am a fairly logical person, but emotion can sometimes take lead.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\- I want to be more productive and efficient but don't know how. \n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\- I like reading books and manhwas. I like manhwas because they are easy to read and digest. Easy dopamine injections. I like reading books because because they help me imagine things that I cannot experience or see in real life. I especially prefer books that use concepts that could in fact happen in real life, for example the hard sci-fi genre. But I also enjoy books with good plot and well written characters with stories that remain in the mind for long.\n\nI also like gaming. It is a fun way to waste time. Grinding for objectives, defeating bosses, amazing stories. They are like books, but interactable. Sometimes I create mods for games if I am able to.\n\nI recently started running. I used to lift but because of my situation I cannot lift, so I decided to run. I don't know why I like running. I find it a good way to develop a different type of muscle and to improve my stamina.\n\nI also love listening to music. So much that I have become dependent on it. I believe it has somewhat reduced my ability to think, but I love finding new music to listen to. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\- I believe I am a visual and kinaesthetic learner. (I don't understand what is meant by learning environment). I prefer classes that involve logic. I don't enjoy memorisation but can do with it, while I am okay with creativity and physical classes.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\- I am not very good at strategise I think. I tend to overall highlight certain targets and wing the process. Sometimes I don't hit those targets so the project may end much more differently than planned at the start. \n\nSome other times, when I like the project, I tend to imagine it and then work towards achieving it. Normally by myself, as I struggle to share my vision to others and have them follow it.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n\\- I want to grow up as a person. I have been told I am still immature and I realised that I am still immature, so I want to become a mature person. Professionally I want to be successful and knowledgeable. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\- I am afraid of snakes lmao. I am also scared of going in trouble with the law and have my options in life stolen. I want to be able to do whatever. \n\nI am uncomfortable in highly emotional atmospheres, especially with people I am not close with. I am also uncomfortable with people I do not like and with people that do not like me and with people I do not know, as I am quite awkward socially. \n\nI don't hate anything in particular because everything has a good and a bad side. But there are a couple of things. For example, I don't like whenever people act in certain destructive/obstructive/annoying ways to get what they want. Especially when there could be better ways of achieving them without bothering others. For example, certain types protesters, like the ones that block roads. Sure, I understand where they come from, but the way they go about protesting barely illicits any positive sentiment towards their ideals. Want to stop oil? Ok, but don't stop my car, I'm tired and trying to go home. \n\nI also hate sexual assault in particular actually. I hate it. Despicable. No good reason behind it and just makes the world worse for everyone.\n\nI also strongly dislike people with very strong views on certain topics. They just annoy me a lot. I like to question them and try to piss them off by trying to break their arguments down. Not just with people that I don't agree with, but with people that I agree with sometimes too. Though it's rare, because I don't want to be hated too much.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- No idea. I think it's a state where I am continuously content and when my life is in order. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- When everything is wrong and when there is some kind of huge decision with huge implications behind any path I could take. Basically, when I feel trapped.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\- I want to be attached to reality, but I daydream often. I think about things that obsess me and think about random things that I see. I think my daydreaming is affected by whenever I force myself back to reality for a little. I barely pay attention to what's around me because it bores me quickly. Sometimes I completely forget about my surroundings or just depersonalise and feel like I am in a videogame. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\- I think I would think about how exciting it is to be in such a condition. Then I would think about some random thought and obsess over it. But I would also probably turn crazy soon enough.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\- It takes a long time if I am by myself. I try to wait as much as possible before taking a decision. And when I do and can't go back I just live with it. If I can change my mind and overturn the decision I could but I learned that it would lead to me just changing my mind over and over, so I try to keep my decision as much as possible and limit myself to two changes of mind, though they take a long time regardless as I just weight pros and cons and how others may be impacted. Though funnily enough I sometimes know the answer deep inside, and sometimes I choose not to listen to it and listen to my pros and cons that include what other people instead.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\- I don't know. I am rarely sad but can feel like that deeply even more rarely. I've only cried a few times alone. In my daily life, emotions don't play too much of a role. Maybe frustration and extreme irrational anger rarely. I am normally neutral or content. So I would say that emotions don't play much of a role.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\- Yes. All the time. I go along with what they say and bring up points to support their arguments. But sometimes I cannot stand the bullcrap I let them say  or just feel bold so I speak up and tell them why they are wrong or bring contrasting viewpoints. Normally I just let people speak because I don't want to be hated or disliked. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\n\\- Yes, especially when I know I can get away with it and when it makes sense to break them. I do believe authority should be challenged sometimes. It cannot be denied that some rules and laws are there for a reason and therefore should be challenged. Though I admit I do break rules often, even when I see the reason why they were set in the first place - I usually think it's no big deal and that I can gain from them.\n\nFrom different tests I've done over time, I usually got ENTP, followed by INTP. I also relate to ENFP.\n\nSo what the hell am I? I can't stop coming up with reasons why I am not either and tests aren't accurate. Or maybe I am in denial and know the answer already, but what outside confirmation. Or maybe my knowledge of the functions isn't deep enough. Help me please.\n\nAlso, sorry for long post.

{"submission": "So I recently dived into theory after years of thinking I'm isfp, turned out I didn't know wtf fi is actually about lol, I don't really use it as well as te.   \nNarrowed it down to xstp but that's where I got stuck. I'm honestly trying but I'm probably not introspective enough to understand if I'm ti or se dom, so I decided to hit it from the back and try to pinpoint my inf function. Leaning towards inf ni but would appreciate y'all guys help.   \nSo I'll try to give examples of how my fe and ni work, if something irrelevant comes up in the meantime - sorry, I'm still trying to figure it all out and may mix in things that aren't really connected to these functions. Here goes.   \nFe: I'd say I'm pretty good at the social game, and the fact that I've always been well liked in every group is probably proof enough. I did kind of lack in this department in middle school, noticed that and decided to change it, started observing other people, especially the popular types, and learnt mimicing their actions and mannerisms.   \nI have a broad bank of performative emotions, know when to smile, laugh, what facial expression suits the situation, what to say and how to react, which set of body language to use in order to make a certain impression, which persona to put on to be favoured and liked in a certain group. I learnt all that pretty quickly and was one of the popular girls at HS, got along great with people from my group at uni, was well liked by all of my colleagues at my previous workplace; now I teach teens and they love me too. I never took on leadership roles but was still one of the most high standing and respected members in a group.   \nI really like playing these social games, feeling like I belong, being part of a clique, all that stuff. I feel like an excited kid about to play a new game, it's stimulating for some reason. It does tire me out a bit but I wouldn't call it that stressful.   \nNow that I think about it it kinda sounds like I'm constantly faking it all and am actually dead inside, but not really - I do feel stuff, I do actually like some people, but I'm generally content with liking them in silence, without letting them know about it. But people don't know unless you tell or show them, duh. That was kinda my problem in middle school. My classmates thought I hated them when I actually didn't, I just kinda treated them like npc's and didn't talk to them much lmao. Looking back at myself now I completely understand their frustration, but past me was genuinely surprised and didn't know what was wrong.   \nI have insane loyalty and love for my friends, but sometimes when too much discontent and stress from a relationship pile up, it's like a switch goes off and I start feeling cold and apathetic towards them. I get passive aggressive, instigate conflict to prepare a stage for myself to vent out all of my frustrations with our relationship. I lowkey love conflict, people are most honest when they're angry, fighting lets issues get aired and resolved much quicker compared to a calm and friendly approach.  \nAt times I start projecting my own discontent with people onto them, saying stuff like 'I know y'all actually hate me and secretly think I'm an awful person blahblah', even though I'm aware that it's actually me who harbors animosity here, but I kinda use this strategy as a leeway to let my pals know that they haven't been a good friend lately, treating me worse than they should.   \nNi: that's going to be hard af to write because Ni is so abstract and ephemeral it's insane. I've read tons of info about it and still don't really understand wtf it is. Hoping to at least get a couple of paragraphs out lmao.   \nI don't think about the future, at all. It's very stressful and scary. My mother is all about setting and reaching goals, constantly preaching about how important it is and how results are all that matter. I haven't set a single goal in my life, I don't have an idea of where I'll be in several years, or even a year. I just do stuff and go with the flow, hoping life will take me somewhere nice. It's not that I don't achieve anything, I do, but I'm just always focused on the present moment - I want to take up this hobby, I like doing it, cool, I'm doing it. And suddenly I've been enjoying doing it for so long that I got good at it. Yay! But getting good at it was never a goal in my mind. I just kept doing it because I liked it.   \nI never envision what will be. It's all white fog, even short term like a couple of months. And that's why I never plan ahead in anything. Improvisation has lowkey carried me through life, and pretty successfully might I say.   \nI did try to envision how I or my life will be in the future a couple of times, but it never turned out to be true lol. The visions were either too abstract or simply too hard to achieve. And I never took any steps to reach that imaginary future. Just put together a couple of ideas and called it a day lmao. No wonder nothing came true.   \nBut I do get hunches and gut feelings. At some point I just suddenly know if something is going to happen or be a certain way like right now. I know when I'll get lucky rolling for a new ssr in a gacha game. I know something bad will happen soon (I was once on a train crossing a bridge, felt a weird adrenaline rush like sum dangerous was about to happen, a couple of hours after the bridge collapsed). And vice versa, when things look dire and everyone's scared out of their mind, I'm just there like \ud83d\ude00 because I know everything's going to be fine, and it does turn out fine. It's just some kind of a subconscious short-term psychic ability.   \nAnd one more thing, I read an article about how inf Ni works and it described something I experienced to a t. Last year I was working a horrible secretarial job that was so boring, monotonous and unstimulating that it made me hella depressed. My Se was so unfulfilled that I fell into a mental pit, a crying miserable mess. And that's when I went full on wannabe philosophy guru, constantly thinking about how empty life actually is in the grand scheme of things, how useless and hopeless human existence is, that nothing really mattered, that my life was pointless and the future would be even worse, nothing would get better and I'll suffer forever and ever and ever. And so on. The author of the article I read described it as 'falling into unhealthy Ni' for inf Ni users, and I felt that big time. One of the worst meltdowns I've ever experienced.   \nSo there we have it, I tried to cover as much info about myself concerning fe and ni as possible, if you read all that, thank you haha. If you decide to comment and share your thoughts, I appreciate it :)  \n", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.0029124543}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -6.9560375}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -7.1122875}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -8.7372875}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -8.8154125}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -8.8622875}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.9560375}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -9.0966625}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -9.4247875}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -9.4247875}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.5966625}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -10.1747875}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -10.4247875}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -10.8466625}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -11.0185375}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -11.1122875}, {"token": "Unfortunately", "logprob": -11.1122875}, {"token": "Text", "logprob": -11.7529125}, {"token": "Ast", "logprob": -11.7841625}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -11.8154125}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.00041386887}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -8.531664}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -8.922289}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -10.062914}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -10.969164}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -11.656664}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -12.125414}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -12.344164}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -13.500414}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -14.297289}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -14.812914}, {"token": " available", "logprob": -14.875414}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -14.875414}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -14.937914}, {"token": " personality", "logprob": -15.672289}, {"token": " narrative", "logprob": -15.734789}, {"token": " story", "logprob": -15.859789}, {"token": " astro", "logprob": -15.922289}, {"token": " textual", "logprob": -15.953539}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -16.031664}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.08166896}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -2.7535439}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -4.331669}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -6.894169}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -7.941044}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -9.409794}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -10.034794}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -10.784794}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -11.034794}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -11.816044}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -12.253544}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -12.456669}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -12.737919}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -13.019169}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -13.206669}, {"token": " cannot", "logprob": -13.409794}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -13.659794}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -13.691044}, {"token": " mentions", "logprob": -13.753544}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -13.878544}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -3.888926e-06}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -13.406254}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -13.968754}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -14.218754}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -15.500004}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -16.453129}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -16.867191}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -16.968754}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -17.382816}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -17.515629}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -17.601566}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -17.734379}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -17.835941}, {"token": " have", "logprob": -17.929691}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -17.953129}, {"token": " indicate", "logprob": -18.273441}, {"token": " include", "logprob": -18.281254}, {"token": " little", "logprob": -18.570316}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -18.726566}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -18.757816}]}}
{"submission": " For context, I've been typed as an ISTP or INTP and I'm not sure if i am any of them or something else. What do you guys think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\n\\- Nope, nothing.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n\\- I don't have a job, however, I've been told I'd be a good lawyer or English/history teacher.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\- Well it depends. I love spending time alone, but i wanna do stuff while I'm alone, sitting down bores me to death and i feel wasted if i don't do anything on the weekend. I always need to be doing something and i prefer to do it on my own.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n\\- Outdoors for sure, I am good at sports (Netball, swimming and badminton) however, my communication skills with my teammates is pretty bad.  I like going out a lot, even if it's just to a simple place i just feel better outside than inside. I do enjoy some indoor activities and usually they're more of a 'creative' type.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\-  I'm very curious, sometimes my curiosity gets to me and i start asking unthoughtful questions. I get a lot of thoughts and try to picture a certain situation and all the possibilities that could answer my curiosity. Usually I'm curious about life, just meaning of certain things that fascinate me. Maybe wonder what's going on in peoples heads and how it all works. I like observing my surroundings for more answers to my questions and sometimes i get those answers i seek for.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\- I've done some leadership stuff in the past, but i feel like I'm way too independent. It's hard to rely on others and i tend to explode if someone isn't doing something properly. Sometimes i even take over their jobs if it starts to bother me.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n\\- Maybe my mind is more organized than my surroundings. I'm able to make a plan in my head in a second and follow it, get into action quickly. I do like practical work a lot more than theory. I tend to be ready to do any with my hands, to experience anything new.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\- I am quite artistic. My art is usually landscapes of certain memories in the back of my head. Drawing buildings and what not. I try to keep it realistic. Abstract art isn't really my thing though.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI hate the past and can't deal with it, I'm more focused on what is happening now. I like the future to be unknown and let myself go with the flow of life.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\- Depends on the person. If its someone i don't speak to then i wont help them. But if they're a friend i'll help them out. Sometimes i get a little annoyed because they need help with things than can be easily done but it's not too much of a bad thing.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\- Yes, i live in a household where logic isn't used too often when making decisions and it bothers me when for certain decisions they don't use logic.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\- I like to be productive, i dont like to lie around and do nothing.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\-if we're doing a task then i probably would without noticing.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\- Playing guitar, video games, taking walks in the morning, reading books, drawing, painting, writing, and sports (the ones i stated before). I like these because some are relaxing and some make me think a lot.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\- So subjects i enjoy to begin with are maths, pdhpe and visual arts. I struggle learning in a loud atmosphere or even when learning in groups. I prefer doing things on my own. The practical side of pdhpe and art is what i enjoy most about them. I like maths for the use of reason. Like it's methods and equations and how one equals to another.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\- Improvise for sure- I know i'm able to finish something on time so i just do it last second and quickly too.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n\\- Just live a normal successful life, maybe even answer a few more questions that keep me up at night but other than that just a normal lifestyle.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\- Fights, especially unnecessary ones. I feel uncomfortable with compliments and physical touch. I just don't know how to react to it or how to respond to it.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- I would just be in a good mood for some times, joke around sometimes. But usually i'm just neutral.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\- i start putting pressure on myself.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\- i don't day dream often, i used to but its been a year since all the day dreaming stuff. I pay attention to what I'm focusing on only. Sometimes my mind is just blank and i think of nothing for hours.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\- Why i'm here, how i ended up here, maybe think about what is possible to do now.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\- I can be indecisive, especially with big decisions. i try to think of what could happen if i do \"this or that\" and then choose the best outcome. Sometimes my decisions change. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\- I try to think about what i'm feeling. Just try to figure out this feeling before i fully process it in my head. Emotions are important in a way but as i grew older i haven't really been expressing them that often.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\- Nope, i have strong opinions. I dont agree with anyone to make them happy i just say what i believe in. It also keeps the conversations interesting.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\n\\- YES, i have broken so much rules that it's always expected of me to do something crazy or just out of the blue. Well challenging authorities is a big step but it really depends on what rule i'm breaking.

{"submission": "I went to elementary school with she and her siblings (she has two sisters, both are a bit older.) Her mother is (well, I suppose was) actually a photographer, and I remember that she was actually once in a magazine because of it. Her mother is a housewife, and has been one since the girls were all little. \n\nI remember that I was actually in an engineering (STEM, to be a bit more specific) program with her in elementary school - I would have been in fifth-grade, and she would have been in fourth-grade. Children who were considered to be good at math were \u201cchosen\u201d to be apart of the program. I remember, even years later (though I suppose that my memory isn\u2019t *that* bad) that I did not like this girl. She struck me as being spoiled, and bratty - I recall that her mother was actually once at one of the meetings, and that she seemed to be whining to her mother about something. I remember that she just seemed a bit self-centered, like one of those kids who complains about things a lot (I actually suspect that she was her mother\u2019s favorite child between the three - I think that her mother is an ExFJ, and if you glance through her mom\u2019s old Flickr account, you\u2019ll notice that there are more pictures of this girl than there are her sisters.) I don\u2019t remember her as having been \u201cdumb,\u201d though. She just seemed chatty (didn\u2019t talk to me really directly, or at least I don\u2019t think she did) and like she had a lot of energy. This is actually a video of her from a long time ago if you\u2019d like to know what she was like: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9uf8bBeBY \n\nI remember that she did or does follow the activist account for an organization I had been part of. \n\nI have the impression that she has \u201ccalmed down\u201d a lot over the years - she has ended up going to the same high school as her two older sisters instead of choosing one that her friends would have attended. I have the impression that if I met her now, she wouldn\u2019t be as loud and annoying. She is quite thin, and does not strike me as being particularly likely to have a child (she has not done or said anything on social media that would indicate that she is opposed to the idea of having one, but I just feel as though her second older sister - the one who is the middle child - is more likely to have a baby years down the line than she is.) She bakes sometimes, even though her mom is a housewife, and seemingly learned to when she was in middle school. I remember that when I followed her old Instagram account, there was a picture of her where she looked nervous and was covering her mouth somewhat self consciously (she wore braces at one point so perhaps someone teased her about her teeth.) \n\nShe started going by \u201cLiz\u201d (which is a nickname for her real name, \u201cElizabeth\u201d) instead of \u201cAnne\u201d at some point in either middle school or ninth grade. I remember that this surprised me when I found out about it, since she grew up being called \u201cAnne\u201d (which is really her middle name) and I had just never expected she\u2019d change her preferred name like that. I personally wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t myself.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16i9yxv)", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.00018101456}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -8.968931}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -10.515806}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -11.328306}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -12.625181}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -12.984556}, {"token": "Text", "logprob": -13.031431}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -13.250181}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -13.422056}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -13.593931}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -14.031431}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -15.140806}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -15.625181}, {"token": " The", "logprob": -15.828306}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -15.875181}, {"token": "Data", "logprob": -15.984556}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -16.172056}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -16.250181}, {"token": "Ind", "logprob": -16.453306}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -17.015806}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -9.610702e-06}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -12.03126}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -13.18751}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -13.984385}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -14.40626}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -15.734385}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -16.68751}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -16.734385}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -17.09376}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -18.37501}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -19.06251}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -19.171885}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -19.890635}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -20.09376}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -20.140635}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -20.453135}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -20.59376}, {"token": " story", "logprob": -20.671885}, {"token": " sign", "logprob": -21.12501}, {"token": " astro", "logprob": -21.171885}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.010992172}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -4.979742}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -5.526617}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -9.589117}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -12.260992}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -13.510992}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -14.432867}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -15.026617}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -15.339117}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -15.339117}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -15.589117}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -15.776617}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -16.182867}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -16.760992}, {"token": " makes", "logprob": -16.901617}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -17.120367}, {"token": " you", "logprob": -17.354742}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -17.573492}, {"token": " Does", "logprob": -17.745367}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -17.792242}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -4.3202e-07}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -16.421875}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -16.609375}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -17.484375}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -17.53125}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -17.625}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -17.984375}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -18.554688}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -18.914062}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -19.625}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -19.664062}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -20.03125}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -20.40625}, {"token": " now", "logprob": -20.570312}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -20.640625}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -20.75}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -20.8125}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -20.859375}, {"token": ".not", "logprob": -21.21875}, {"token": "nt", "logprob": -21.4375}]}}
{"submission": " The past 1-2 years I have been unsure of my MBTI type :')  DKFADGJEDIOFASXLAGA\n\nWriting this out was like count grains of sand on the beach, butt I want to be properly typed :')) \n\nBackground: I am a tired fatigued 30 cm dark circled college person\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?  \\*\\*Very very refreshed. I would love to stay by myself in my room. However, I would not be able to stay without my computer. Ultimately, I would find myself trolling people on discord or on reddit. I might bake as well. \\*\\*\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?  \\*\\*I naturally had interest in insects, plants, and geometric group theory. When I was younger, I really liked to hike, especially to observe different patterns and family groups of plant species.  I play tennis occasionally; I don't mind and quite enjoy chasing runner's high.\\*\\*\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? \\*\\*I am unsure of the extent of my curiosity. I have more conceptual ideas than I can execute usually. For example, while zoning out, I would come up with a proof, but later forget or would be too preoccupied to complete or finalize.\\*\\*\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? \\*\\* In any setting, I am terrible with group work. Either I will be in control of the whole thing or I will be doing it by myself. Literally, there will be an coup d'etat if I was an leader.\\*\\*\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy         \n\\*\\* I am terrible with working with my hands. I have tried art, but eventually I would create hideous drawings/creatures literally from the armpits of Hades. \\*\\*\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them? \\*\\*This question is too complicated and will require additional 30 pages, therefore I will not answer for the sake of my sanity. \\*\\*\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? \\*\\*If it was doing something mischievous, such as helping someone troll online or in real life, I would do it. Of course, I would weight the pros (personal satisfaction) and cons (lowered social status/broken relationship).\\*\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? \\*\\*Naturally, I am manipulative, but it is moslty used for friendliness. Question: At what extent is it controlling? The person I am trying to manipulate has decided to think that way. It was their decision to respond that way to my input. Haha, jk....\\*\\*\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? \\*\\*When learning new concepts, the first question I ask is \"why\" and \"how.\" Looking up multiple different proofs, and the proofs of the theorem in the proof.  After that phrase of in-depth searching of the concept, I go onto it's applications both theoretical and physical.\\*\\*\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? \\*\\*Start by planning and breaking up tasks, but end up not following them. At the last minute, I wing my projects and improvise as I go.\\*\\*\n* What are your aspirations? \\*\\* I wanted to make a mark in history when I was younger like John Nash. Now, I just want to be healthy.\\*\\*\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like? \\*\\*Weirdly, when I am mentally in the trenches, I am very very tidy. I find myself cleaning everything up. Mentally sharp.\\*\\*\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? \\*\\*Uhhh, for how long? If there is nothing for me to do, can I burn calories?? Will I be wearing clothes? Will someone moniter me?\\*\\*\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? \\*\\* \n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? \\*\\*I have learned to stay silent. I don't show agreement or disagreement. I can't agree to an false conclusion. I usually end up debating sometimes.\\*\\*\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you? \\*\\*I used to be in detention almost daily during my teen years for talking or making kids laugh....I didn't care about rules. I think authority should be challenged if they are incapable. Some rules are necessary such being intoxicated while skiing or sexual assult. \\*\\*\n\nWelp....what am I?", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.0015487834}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -6.751549}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -9.017174}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -9.423424}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -9.767174}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -10.079674}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -10.532799}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -11.189049}, {"token": "Text", "logprob": -11.673424}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -12.220299}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -12.282799}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -12.829674}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -12.829674}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -13.157799}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -13.470299}, {"token": "Unfortunately", "logprob": -13.673424}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -13.814049}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -13.829674}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -13.876549}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -14.173424}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -4.2868523e-05}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -10.312543}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -12.093793}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -13.156293}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -13.718793}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -14.875043}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -15.609418}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -15.968793}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -16.250042}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -16.281292}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -16.890667}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -18.140667}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -18.453167}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -18.484417}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -18.640667}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -19.000042}, {"token": " available", "logprob": -20.031292}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -20.046917}, {"token": " personality", "logprob": -20.093792}, {"token": " textual", "logprob": -20.781292}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.020687398}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -4.1769376}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -5.3019376}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -9.161312}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -10.692562}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -11.567562}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -12.661312}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -13.301937}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -13.833187}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -13.942562}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -14.176937}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -14.395687}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -14.583187}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -14.723812}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -15.692562}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -16.005062}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -16.051937}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -16.051937}, {"token": " makes", "logprob": -16.567562}, {"token": " doesnt", "logprob": -16.598812}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -1.3856493e-06}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -14.515626}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -15.390626}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -15.593751}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -16.000002}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -16.11719}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -16.36719}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -17.718752}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -17.77344}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -17.859377}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -18.02344}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -18.05469}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -18.101564}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -18.257814}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -18.312502}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -18.578127}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -18.578127}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -18.77344}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -18.843752}, {"token": " now", "logprob": -18.914064}]}}
{"submission": "Yes, based on the title, I\u2019m debating between ENTP and ISFJ. I can\u2019t tell at all. I have actually made a post regarding my type under this subreddit (I think some of y\u2019all will know lmao). But let me give a better description to finalise my decision once and for all. I\u2019ll read up more about the functions on my own afterwards too, but now my exams are coming up, so naturally I don\u2019t have the time to read up on everything, and I just want to clear this up before I get too distracted. So pls bear with me \ud83d\ude4f sorry for annoying anyone; I must look really desperate rn :((\n\n1) I am 15F. Singaporean\n\n2) dk if this is relevant - Brought up in a family with parents who are very loving, but very overprotective (I still love them dearly tho, besides I see where they come from when they act that way). \n\n3) Had a struggle finding ways to fit in when I was younger. Through past experience, and by picking up social cues, I learnt how to socialise. Am still social awkward tho to an extent\n\n4) My key traits, I feel, are diligent, nurturing, thoughtful and reflective. I view myself as diligent (tho it may not link to typology, because every type can be diligent ofc) because I never, EVER back down even after a failure. For instance, when I fail a school subject, I\u2019ll feel absolutely horrible, but I am not prone to giving up. I almost always find ways and alternatives to improve. My failures genuinely make me mad, and that anger really motivates me to do better. I am nurturing because 1), people have constantly described me as welcoming, kind, empathetic and caring. And 2), I realise how fast people tend to open up to me. And I am proud to say that I am able to cheer people up real fast. I\u2019d call myself thoughtful because, well, partially because of the way I\u2019m writing this post. But also because I constantly try to think about my mindset, as well as the world around me as a whole. My teacher once told me that she admired how broadly I think and how fast I am able to read between the lines and build connections. I\u2019d say it\u2019s true to a degree. I can analyse the people around me (oftentimes being able to correctly guess my peers\u2019 relationships with others), the world\u2019s different problems as well (? Tho i think I\u2019m getting worse at it lmao) as how people think differently (esp compared to me). I can even vividly remember my mindset when I was a kid. \n\n5) I\u2019m quite nostalgic. I love reminiscing abt my past memories. I even made it a Tradition to review my year annually to celebrate my growth and pick apart what was unique about that year. Very tiring sometimes, but well, it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been doing for a long time. So I\u2019d never back out from a tradition that means so much to me. \n\n6) when I\u2019m listening to others\u2019 problems, while I definitely try my best to make them feel better first, the way I approach their problems is by tackling the issue first before giving them emotional comfort. I try to understand WHY they\u2019re feeling that way to begin with. Then I try to identify their stressors. Then I try my best to think about how they\u2019d feel because of these stressors, esp after knowing how they\u2019re like. THEN I give advice based on my own insight and experience. I never like to be blunt because ik it\u2019ll make them feel worse. But I\u2019ve learnt that being honest while being empathetic is better. I still am prone to sugar-coating facts, though. \n\n7) Time to talk about my flaws. Im very stubborn. Like, REALLY stubborn. I dont Like to change myself unless I feel the need to do so. If someone criticises me, I either ignore them or take it really personally. And another reason why I\u2019m stubborn is because I hate it when someone comments about my schedule or way of living my life. That has happened a lot and I get very annoyed. It\u2019s even worse if that person doesn\u2019t even have a valid reason for saying that. I prefer determining myself if I have to change my habits than have other people tell me what to do. I am also very conflict averse. I hate confronting people, I hate BEING confronted, I hate just seeing a heated argument. I want things to be kept peaceful among people. That has unfortunately led to me having many miscomms with my ex-friends. I am also incapable of making long-term decisions. I guess it\u2019s normal for a 15y/o, but like\u2026it\u2019s concerning for me. An example is when i really wanted to get into a particular school after graduating from secondary school. We had the option to apply early to schools of our choice, so that was what I did. But literally 2 weeks after submitting my application, I was like, \u201cwait. What if this school doesn\u2019t suit me? What if another school suits me?\u201d Andddd I ended up revoking my application. Sooo yeah. Oh, and I\u2019m rather irrational at times. I Jump to conclusions way too fast about my friends due to my insecurities and paranoia. Like \u201cwhat if my best friend prefers friend A over me?\u201d It has also led to a few fallen friendships.\n\n8) when I grow up, I want to live a life that I will thoroughly enjoy. I want to be around my loved ones and friends (or if i get married, my partner ). I want to get into my desired career path (communications/social sciences :D). I want to explore a few jobs in that field, then settle into one I feel is most fruitful. I want to understand everyone and how various forms of media impact others. I just want to live a life I can reminisce about. \n\nOnce again, I sincerely apologise if I annoy anyone here. I might look really desperate rn. The reason why I\u2019m posting this again is because, while I was convinced for a while that I might be an ENTP, it still didn\u2019t really make sense to me how my descriptions in my previous post = Ne.

{"submission": "I am an eighteen year old woman. I will note that I am perhaps somewhat shallow deep down inside - I cried (yes, cried\u2026 I have been especially depressed lately, though) because today I realized, even though I\u2019d perhaps started to get my hopes up a bit on Tuesday, that the conventionally attractive guy who I tend to check in on (I even gave him my number on Tuesday just to ensure he could text someone if he needs help) will not be asking me out. I concluded this based in part on his expression when I asked him if he\u2019d like to take a picture of what we did before he came to class (he always comes in late) - it\u2019s hard to explain, but it was really a combination of his body language/expression throughout class (the vibes I was getting) and the fact that he chose to sit behind me even though the seat right next to me was open which led me to conclude that he won\u2019t be asking me out. I figure, even though I\u2019m not positive, that he either suspects or \u201cknows\u201d (I think he\u2019s an ISTP) that I\u2019m attracted to him/have a crush on him, once again just based off vibes - but everything he did today, if I am to analyze his behavior, actually leads me to believe that there is no real attraction on his part/no real plan to ask me out. On Tuesday I was sort-of getting different vibes, but I still believe anyhow that his behavior today means that he won\u2019t be asking me out. \n\nWhen I was walking home (and I walk home everyday from college, in part because I am from a poor family and we really do need to save as much money as we can) I cried a bit because I am someone who has grown up feeling very insecure about my physical appearance (I am a black woman and am perhaps slightly below average facially. I\u2019m conscious of the fact that this has emphasized because of where I live/who I live around.) I remember that I just genuinely felt really bad, because I feel like no one will ever properly want me (I also felt silly because I know deep down inside that I am too busy with both school and my part-time job to really be able to handle having a boyfriend right now. I know that if I do get into another relationship, it will likely fail since I have low self esteem and need to take care of my mental health.) I was thinking about how deep down inside, even though I do think I want to marry and have a child, I am worried that I will never find a man who will stay with me and truly care for me (I actually have a part-time job wherein I work with children.) I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and don\u2019t come from a \u201cgood home.\u201d \n\nMy coworker recently described me as being \u201cdiplomatic,\u201d \u201csweet,\u201d and \u201cgood at communicating.\u201d \n\nThese are my social media accounts (my book review account, and my old Archive of Our Own account - I actually started on fanfiction.net when I was still in elementary school, if you can believe it); https://instagram.com/bookreviewsbynairobi?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== and https://archiveofourown.org/works/41223696 \n\nI do tend to \u201cnotice\u201d physical details, and the like. I will note that I tend to have an idea of where I think someone else is looks wise (whether they are average, slightly below it, or slightly above it.) I\u2019ve realized that I don\u2019t trust most people (in part due to bad personal experiences with people,) and that I can actually be quite judgmental about the appearances of other people, even though I don\u2019t *think* I treat anyone differently because of it. \n\nI tend to stress a lot over what will happen the upcoming day, like just over small things. I think this is probably a factor in me always looking as tired as I do. I have had a lot of trouble dealing with the fact that things are so different now more recently. I spend a lot of time online.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16j1ev1)", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.0035466165}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -5.8472967}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.347297}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -8.847297}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -9.222297}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.941047}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -10.737922}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -10.753547}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -10.816047}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -11.269172}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -11.862922}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -11.972297}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -12.237922}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -12.550422}, {"token": "Text", "logprob": -12.675422}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -12.925422}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -12.941047}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -13.019172}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -13.128547}, {"token": "Without", "logprob": -13.159797}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.00015026369}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -9.187651}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -10.812651}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -11.234526}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -12.015776}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -12.578276}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -13.156401}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -13.312651}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -14.359526}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -15.656401}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -15.828276}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -16.2189}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -16.37515}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -16.75015}, {"token": " astro", "logprob": -16.9689}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -16.984526}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -17.0939}, {"token": " available", "logprob": -17.109526}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -17.234526}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -17.359526}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.027884487}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -3.6060095}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -8.2622595}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -9.7153845}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -11.6060095}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -12.1372595}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -13.2935095}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -14.0903845}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -14.1216345}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -14.1528845}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -14.7935095}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -15.0903845}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -15.1372595}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -15.5591345}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -15.8560095}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -15.9497595}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -16.090385}, {"token": " doesnt", "logprob": -16.44976}, {"token": " hasn", "logprob": -16.465385}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -16.559135}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -7.89631e-07}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -15.250001}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -15.781251}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -16.046875}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -16.15625}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -17.273438}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -17.296875}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -17.65625}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -18.007812}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -18.578125}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -18.609375}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -18.648438}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -18.78125}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -18.835938}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -19.015625}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -19.039062}, {"token": " have", "logprob": -19.046875}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -19.234375}, {"token": " to", "logprob": -19.304688}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -19.476562}]}}
{"submission": "When I was a teenager, I used to have this 'frenemy' that would constantly follow me around, eavesdrop on conversations I had in order to reference things I said and bond with me through that, and SMS/call me nonstop during our last year of school together. During that time in my youth, I was an aggressively mentally ill, nihilistic loner (unhealthy enneagram 5 alert), so I initially dismissed his offers at closeness as thinly-veiled attempts to mock me behind my back with his buddies because of his overt fuckboy personality and bourgeois lifestyle/demeanour. I even insulted his intelligence in such a crass manner so much that his responses to my badgering went from passive-aggressive teasing to straight-up impulsive angry jabs at my repulsive attitude and appearance. However, looking back on it now, I can see that all of the things he\u2019s done for me were attempts at comforting me and trying to help me become a part of the group as a result of him being extremely sensitive to the predicaments of my debilitating neurological impairments.\n\nI was considering that his developed Ni could\u2019ve been due to him being an obvious enneagram 3. But I honestly wouldn\u2019t know the difference between ESTP and ENFJ 3s either when I think about it in the context of this guy. All I know is he really wanted to be my friend and would constantly push me to throw parties that everyone in the class would like and playfully tease me about how no one would wanna hang out at the library or at a party with no alcohol, kebab pizza (I was and still am a proud vegetarian), or girls they can bring along. So that\u2019s what made me think Se dom back then.\n\nAnd the more obvious ENFJs in my class just always seemed way more mature and serious than he was, but it was probably due to him having a to 7 fix in his tritype compared the others. He was one of the two fuckboys at my table that would toss my pens in the air and snatch my notebook from me when I was busy studying in order to pay attention to him.\n\nExcept rather than trying to contradict and indoctrinate my worldview with a more cynical perspective, he usually would push and tease me in a much more gentle manner with a soft smile on his face compared to his fellow fuckboys. I did that even more than he did and he loved how straightforward and honest I was, but also desperately wanted me to stop at some point because he felt like I was just shooting myself in the foot and got extremely tired of holding back his own life for that.\n\nI also always thought that he was an obvious ESTP since he mostly thought about materialistic things (golfing, his status in society, appearance) and always enjoyed living in the present moment (partying, being shamelessly kinky/horny) whilst getting frustrated at me for overthinking things instead of taking action. He also would devote a significant amount of our arguments to bluntly criticising how I chose to present myself to others through immensely detailed similes, as though implying that my behaviour was so 'ugly and nasty' that it reminded him of a spooky spider that creeps and crawls underneath one\u2019s desk, and that I\u2019d never succeed in life acting like that. On the other hand, during those arguments, he\u2019d also make these ominous predictions about my future that ended up being eerily accurate to how my life ended up turning out, which I would acknowledge in the back of my head but was too delusional in my image to confront head-on. This makes me consider that his Ni is higher in his function stack than I was initially led to believe, especially when one takes into account that he was 16-19 years old when he had these premonitions about me. \n\nFor further context about these 'premonitions', he often gave me the benefit of the doubt compared to other guys of his typical teenage boy archetype whenever I was overwhelmed and delusional because he figured that I simply suffered from some type of mental disorder, and that\u2019s why I was lashing out or displaying inappropriate behaviour. So as a result, he seemed to spend a lot of time with me, prying into my life to find out what kind of things I liked to seem like less of a threat and deweaponise things with me in general. By the end of year 9, he went on a massive tangent about how everything I was doing was ugly, stupid, and nasty and that people would just treat me like a joke once we went into our first year of high school. So for the first two years of high school, I took his advice and got my act together, but the problem was that I was hanging around with the wrong kinds of people who would romanticise depression and shit, and they often criticised me for seeming pretty normie compared to them, so I eventually fell back to my old habits, and that ended up ruining my life, just like he predicted.\n\nI went back to him at 18 hoping to rekindle our connection, and he was very happy and enthusiastic to do so until he felt like I was going to lead him into a position where he\u2019d feel my therapist. So he expressed things like - \"You\u2019ll never get a job with that mental disorder to bear\" -, but also how he wanted me to know that everything was going to be okay before exiting my life forever.\n\nBut idk, what do you guys think of this?\n\nP.S. \u301c I\u2019m sooo sure he was enneagram 3 and had 378 as his tritype.", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.002250888}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -6.3616257}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.846001}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -9.439751}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -9.814751}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -9.830376}, {"token": "Text", "logprob": -10.236626}, {"token": "CON", "logprob": -10.517876}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -10.627251}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -10.705376}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -10.721001}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -11.408501}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -12.096001}, {"token": "Ind", "logprob": -12.111626}, {"token": "I", "logprob": -12.642876}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -12.674126}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -12.674126}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -12.783501}, {"token": "Unc", "logprob": -12.846001}, {"token": "Und", "logprob": -12.877251}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -3.7027545e-05}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -11.125037}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -11.171912}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -13.000037}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -13.015662}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -13.812537}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -13.859412}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -13.906287}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -14.812537}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -15.156287}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -16.718786}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -17.171911}, {"token": " story", "logprob": -17.406286}, {"token": " data", "logprob": -18.312536}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -18.343786}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -18.359411}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -18.437536}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -18.828161}, {"token": " sign", "logprob": -18.953161}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -18.953161}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.009123954}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -4.993499}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -6.102874}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -10.477874}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -11.040374}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -11.759124}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -12.165374}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -13.555999}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -13.821624}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -13.837249}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -13.852874}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -15.102874}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -15.274749}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -15.384124}, {"token": " makes", "logprob": -15.509124}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -15.805999}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -15.837249}, {"token": " Does", "logprob": -16.384125}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -16.415375}, {"token": " fails", "logprob": -16.509125}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -2.220075e-06}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -13.812502}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -15.476564}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -15.804689}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -15.820314}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -16.093752}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -16.17969}, {"token": " does", "logprob": -16.80469}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -17.632814}, {"token": " mention", "logprob": -17.640627}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -17.664064}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -17.781252}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -18.031252}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -18.078127}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -18.171877}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -18.30469}, {"token": " bot", "logprob": -18.320314}, {"token": " now", "logprob": -18.351564}, {"token": " to", "logprob": -18.390627}, {"token": " nota", "logprob": -18.406252}]}}
{"submission": "Question: do you believe in friendship between guys and girls?\n\nMy answer: not really.. I mean physically is can exist because if two people decide to not to do something else then it can exist on a superficial level (and only superficial, so without hanging out, opening emotionally, talking for fun..) which in 90% of cases it is dictated by the social positions in which one finds oneself, for example two work colleagues or boss\u2013employee dynamic. (Then to be totally honest if you'd like to fuck a coworker it's always possible but it goes against normal social rules in many cases lol, no one likes that).\nOn the other side on a mental level it cannot exist, there is always (in any case) someone who is attracted to the other person, maybe not everyday, maybe not totally in a conscious way, but even those minutes where you think about the other person in that way then it doesn't count as a real friendship.\nJust by thinking abt it, how weird would it be if a mom says to her family before leaving home: 'I'm hanging out with my male friend, bye byee' I mean she could say at the limit 'coworker' but if she says friend and means exactly 'friend' then the family would be angry asf and me and you would be laughing.\n\nBTW this is only my opinion, if you want to talk about it I'm truly opened to new ideas/opinions.", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.045495197}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -3.1704953}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -7.014245}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -7.076745}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -8.295495}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -9.107995}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -9.62362}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -9.65487}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -9.670495}, {"token": "Unc", "logprob": -10.045495}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -10.201745}, {"token": "Ind", "logprob": -10.24862}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -11.389245}, {"token": "Z", "logprob": -11.451745}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -11.84237}, {"token": "Sc", "logprob": -12.02987}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -12.139245}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -12.264245}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -12.295495}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -12.451745}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -6.46828e-05}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -10.093815}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -11.45319}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -11.656315}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -13.531315}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -13.85944}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -13.937565}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -14.26569}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -16.20319}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -17.76569}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -17.82819}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -17.875065}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -18.07819}, {"token": " astro", "logprob": -18.64069}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -18.67194}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -18.843815}, {"token": " textual", "logprob": -18.89069}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -19.20319}, {"token": " content", "logprob": -19.60944}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -19.70319}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.008834259}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -4.9150844}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -7.2588344}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -7.3057094}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -9.555709}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -12.524459}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -12.836959}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -12.899459}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -13.555709}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -14.352584}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -14.633834}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -14.977584}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -15.040084}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -15.149459}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -15.258834}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -15.586959}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -15.961959}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -16.008835}, {"token": " cannot", "logprob": -16.040085}, {"token": " in", "logprob": -16.196335}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -2.1008714e-06}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -13.890627}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -15.046877}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -15.109377}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -15.890627}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -16.125002}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -16.203127}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -17.24219}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -17.250002}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -17.421877}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -17.687502}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -17.734377}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -18.468752}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -18.476564}, {"token": " indicate", "logprob": -18.500002}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -18.55469}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -18.656252}, {"token": " specify", "logprob": -18.765627}, {"token": " have", "logprob": -18.851564}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -18.953127}]}}
{"submission": "Guys can you please help me type myself. I have recently taken tests for various type of personality test among with i got-\nFor MBTI-\nENTJ, ESTJ and ESFJ\nFor enneagram-\nEnneagram 3\n\nEmotions -\nMaybe my perceptions of ESTJ are too different for me to believe i am an ESTJ(i get ESTJ most recently). I always thought i was an ESFJ or let's say an F for a long time since i tend to be very empathetic and i tend to be very emotional. But lately after seeing and reading about personality types I have been more accepting of me being a T and not an F due to me being very rational and i keep my emotions and feelings aside when making decisions (majority of the time).\n\nJudging 'xxxJ' -\nI am pretty sure I am a J because I tend to be very systematic and I would list down all the things I would be doing for the day or even the following week with some future plans for years ahead as well. Also I am a perfectionist, I like things to be kept in place, I might not be as hard working as other perfectionist but most of the time I am. Let's say my house is in a mess and I don't feel like cleaning the whole day, I will still clean before I go to bed because I cannot rest well until and unless I am neat and clean. And yes you could say I am a clean freak. Once I clean, it has to be perfectly clean, I don't do so-so cleanings. (These are stuffs I read online for a j, basically planning and also my friends agree I am too much of a J and could never be a P \ud83d\udc80\n\nSensing 'xSxx' -\nAs for Sensing I'm not quite sure myself. Even though I read lots of meanings for the 'S, sensing' I can never really come to a conclusion as to what it means, if you've already read this far please tell me what sensing is I am at a lost. I did see something that goes like 'learning from past and thinking about really and not what if' I'm not too sure so don't come at me for it. But yes I will say from this meaning that I got. I learn from past experience. If I come across any problems and I have experience a similar situation or anyone I know have experienced a similar situation, I take action from the way I/they did. Let's say, a friend brought some game from an online store and had bad experience with the thing he/she brought, I would consider buying a different one as the one they brought wasn't to their satisfaction. (And so far another trait of mine is I always make an example whenever I explain something. And always the simplest example possible). \nIf I happen to come across a situation I have never heard of or known of, I would first check online if anyone has gone through it, or course I would check different articles and videos for it and decide what I would do but trust me in the process I think of the worst case possible and try and find a result for that. Let's say I had done something bad and I got caught from it, but my parents are not aware of it, I will think of a solution to where my parents have found out about it and they are now scolding me for it, by the end if I am at a very high disadvantage, I will just accept my fate (although I solve these situations without the \"if\"s I thought of)\n\nWords -\nI am very blunt with words. If a person is not nice and is acting very selfish/proud or an egoistic person, I don't mind crushing them. Like literally, I have come across lots of people like this and I have talked to them in such a way they get offended to the max. I am very short tempered but I am a very patient person, internally. I can put up with people for weeks and if something really ticks me off I scold them as hard as I can, I don't filter my words at all. And also I read people easily, their expressions, their choice of words and everything I can see through them, if that's the right word. I feel happy when I can see their offended expression when they triggered me. I don't do this to everyone though. Just to those that are veeeeeeeery annoying. I usually filter my words for people I really like, in fact I am quite the people pleaser, I keep everyone happy and I am not hesitant to do any tasks another person is required to do as long as they need help. But never for lazy people.\n\nI have very short attention span -\nThis does not happen for every situation but does alot when people are talking to me, if it's about business and work related, it haaardly happen, or so far I think it has not happened at all. But when chit chatting, if many people are talking to me(I have quite the amount of friends. As extrovert as I can be I feel happy when I interact with lots of friends), I tend to forget what I was saying or even forget when friends ask me something. \n\nAnd I started a job recently and I am very strict with work, work is work personal matter is personal matter. And also I love cleaning alot but I don't do things very fast but when I do it's extremely clean, I can bet on that. And yes 1 more thing, I hate it when you have a fight with others about a certain stuffs and they bring out their ultimate weapon \"you don't care about me\" shit. Like gurl/dude we're talking about practical stuffs and not your stupid emotions. Speaking from experience. And I recently had a fight with my colleague because he was slacking off on his work and he went \"you never asked about my feelings\" this one is a bit different, he has some family problems and he must have had bad news about it but my point is work is work. I don't judge when he's on the phone during working hours as long as there is no work. But if work is there he could just complete it you know, no need to drag his personal stuffs in workplace. Anddd he's an old dude who have had his own company and is on break due to some problems and I am just a kid who barely have 1 month experience  on the real adult's work. Dude why not get your experience to be seen in his work life!! Anyways I am going off topic. But yea that's exactly how I feel about these \"you don't care about me\" escapees. \n\nAnyways help me type myself thanks.", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.017623838}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -4.376999}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -6.423874}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -6.830124}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -7.908249}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -7.923874}, {"token": "In", "logprob": -8.111374}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -8.564499}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -8.673874}, {"token": "Information", "logprob": -8.783249}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -9.111374}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -9.205124}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -9.705124}, {"token": "No", "logprob": -10.142624}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -10.173874}, {"token": "Unfortunately", "logprob": -10.189499}, {"token": "Unc", "logprob": -10.298874}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -10.501999}, {"token": "Due", "logprob": -10.751999}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -10.783249}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.0001787497}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -9.297053}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -10.109553}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -10.922053}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -10.984553}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -12.125178}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -12.828303}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -13.047053}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -14.890803}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -15.515803}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -15.578303}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -16.297054}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -16.422054}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -16.422054}, {"token": " personality", "logprob": -17.234554}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -17.31268}, {"token": " individual", "logprob": -17.422054}, {"token": " submitted", "logprob": -17.68768}, {"token": " subjects", "logprob": -17.890804}, {"token": " mentioned", "logprob": -18.234554}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.046747334}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -3.2186224}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -5.218622}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -8.906122}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -9.968622}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -10.296747}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -11.515497}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -12.202997}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -12.843622}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -12.906122}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -13.281122}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -13.499872}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -13.937372}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -14.171747}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -14.765497}, {"token": " mentions", "logprob": -14.781122}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -14.890497}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -15.093622}, {"token": " doesnt", "logprob": -15.281122}, {"token": " makes", "logprob": -15.281122}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -1.2590794e-05}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -12.625012}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -13.164075}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -13.414075}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -13.64845}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -14.664075}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -14.789075}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -15.101575}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -15.3047}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -15.390637}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -15.5547}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -15.570325}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -15.632825}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -15.914075}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -16.3047}, {"token": " neither", "logprob": -16.312513}, {"token": " nothing", "logprob": -16.414076}, {"token": "-not", "logprob": -16.507826}, {"token": " to", "logprob": -16.515638}, {"token": " nt", "logprob": -16.6172}]}}
{"submission": "\nI am like this guy in the movie Split lol (Not literally though) I've gone from INTP to INFP, then ENTP and now ISFJ. To be honest I was hoping you would help me type me, so Imma tell you a little about me:\n\nEarly Years\n\nI am from Mexico, people here is known to be warm, friendly and yeah, like that, however, since I was a child I was pretty introvert compared to my sister who is certainly an ESFP, anyway, since I was little I was interested in books, specially in encyclopaedias and liked to unscrew VCRs, DVD players and things like that haha. At the same time i was a little afraid of new people, and I went through some family issues that made me feel insecure, that was the time when I went into videogames and spent around 5 hours a day on them, and I oftentimes tried to include people but they wouldn\u2019t (obviously) keep it going with me.\n\nMiddle School \n\nAfter that, I got into middle school, here, I think it was one of the best times of my life because I discovered and got into music, I started playing piano because a friend of mine like to play piano and we both enjoyed Coldplay songs and I wanted to play piano because he did, but surprisingly music became a recurrent part of my life, in that same years, I formed a band and had my first gig at the graduation ceremony at the same time, I think I met my best friends at the time.\n\nHigh School I\n\nThen I got into high school and first, let\u2019s See A was a better student, academically talking, because I never really like to go to school and I found classes to be boring not to say about homework because I always did procrastinate and preferred to do the stuff I wanted to because it was funnier. All of that resulted added to the fact that started skipping classes school, which made me finish it in five years instead of three, but anyway, when I entered high school for the second time more prepared because I had felt that I had hit rock bottom.\n\nHigh School II\n\nOn that second time, I was at academically other student, especially in online classes, because I found that I was more of a self learning person and at the same time, I dated a girl that was like my canon event because I went through some heavy stuff with her but in the end we broke up. Then pandemic was over and it was time to socialise. It was nice :) I made lots of friends all throughout my school and joined another band, we had three gigs and honestly high school was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had. I mainly focused on relationships and people and everyone knew me haha, it was awesome. Also, i had great grades and was able to finish properly but with a whole lot of doubt on what to study in college.\n\nCollege and Bad Decisions\n\nThen it was time to attend college and well\u2026 I wanted to study music but many people had told me it wasn\u2019t profitable and many stuff in general, I was taking many opinions and in the end I went for Communication, even though I find it very difficult to improvise in social situations and improvising in general is a pain for me, I also have to say that I don\u2019t quite like using apps like TikTok and in media, so right now I am planning to go back and pursue my passion which is music, even though the concept of passion is not very applicable to me because the way people feels passionate is kind of alien to me, there are just things that I like and things that bore me out, and since music is the only thing that has been consistent thorough time.\n\nTyping me.\n\nAnyway, hopefully that\u2019s enough information to type me, in addition to that, I gotta say I wouldn\u2019t consider myself responsible nor decisive, I love my friends and family and I like to do the same things over and over again, they give me familiarity. When it comes to functions I can surely say my lowest ones are Te, Se and Ni. Ni being the lowest one of em all.

However, throughout my life, I\u2019ve never been seen as an Esfj or even acted like one, so I think I might be mistyped again, here are some reasons,\n\nFe: Fe makes me considerate, able to sense others\u2019 vibes and wanting to make people happy. However I hate helping people, it exhausts me and not worth it \n\nSi: Si makes me orderly, aware of cleanliness and have good memory. However, I hate talking about past events and Si is encouraged by my parents to use it\n\nNe: Ne makes me creative, imaginative and passionate about possibilities. However, I don\u2019t always like change and Ne is seen more during my childhood\n\nTi: Ti makes my highly curious and able to spot logical inconsistencies quickly. However, I\u2019m not so good at maths, but am interested \n\nFi: Fi clashes with Fe when making decisions, I guess I unconsciously chose Fe than Fi\n\nSe: Se makes me able to use my five senses pretty well. However, I daydream, am clumsy and often feel bad at after too much Se, I dislike Se\n\nNi: Up till now I\u2019m still unsure of how Ni works. I prefer the big picture and likes to think deeply, but Idk if I can predict the future like stereotype Ni users can. However, I feel like my Ni should be higher\n\nTe: Te makes me critical when stressed? I just strongly prefer using Ti more\n\n-If I asked my friends, they would say I\u2019m a thinker more than a feeler\n\n-Although I\u2019m friendly, I\u2019m unemotional and sometimes pretty sarcastic, unlike the usual Esfj who are charming and wholehearted\n\n-I\u2019m a bit shy and not so extroverted, but not typically introverted, kind of in the middle\n\n-I know Esfj tell white lies to prevent harming others, I often tell small lies(never the big ones) too but it\u2019s for preventing myself from getting into an unnecessary conversation with people \n\nThe things that I relate most to Esfj is that I behave differently in front of different people and I care about self image (but have no intent to improve it)\n\nSo am I really Esfj or mistyped?

{"submission": "Here is my relationship with the past, and with the future: I have a lot of anxiety over/around the future, and tend to worry a lot about what hasn\u2019t happened yet/about things I don\u2019t actually have to focus on yet (for example, I actually volunteered to be one of four people who has their essay for English reviewed by their peers, and I remember that I need to turn mine in by Monday evening and have started writing an outline like we were supposed to, but thinking about how I\u2019m supposed to plan out each and every step kind of stresses me out, even though I\u2019ve written many essays and already have my evidence. I suppose that even now, as an 18yr old, I am somewhat worried about the judgement of my peers. I know that this probably will prove to be helpful, though.) I am quite tired right now, always am. I have sleeping issues, I will admit that I messed up my schedule about three years ago. \n\nI am probably partly cynical because I am depressed, and have experienced trauma. I also have anxiety. I have not done a great job of following up to make a new appointment for therapy/get a new therapist even though I know I probably need to see one again, and will be responsible for that myself now that I\u2019m an adult. \n\nI am definitely someone who tends to reflect on the past a lot. I was actually thinking this morning about a guy who I\u2019d had a crush on in freshman year (an ESTP, actually pretty toxic - I remember he once almost fought this girl in my grade because she tripped him a little on the stairs in senior year,) though I was thinking about how him saying I was a 4/10 had really affected my self esteem, and I had started thinking about it more because yesterday I realized (based off body language, facial expression, and general vibes) that a guy who I have been approaching to check in on in Statistics won\u2019t be asking me out. He is nice looking and most likely older than me. I felt rejected in a sense even though he didn\u2019t directly reject me (I would guess that he suspects I like him, though, even though he never said anything of which would indicate this.) \n\nI really lean toward being pessimistic as opposed to optimistic. I have been somewhat worried that I will be fired from the part time job I am working (I work with two-six year olds, and I started as an intern in July due to my prior involvement with Girls Inc) even though I have received absolutely no indication that this will happen. I was happy today at work, I just don\u2019t feel too great now since I seem to have a cold (it\u2019s started to get colder outside) and since I was having trouble with the lab simulation for Anthropology and had to zoom with my professor (I kinda got the vibe she thought it was silly that I was having so much trouble, even though she didn\u2019t say so, or that I\u2019m dumb.) \n\nThese are two social media accounts of mine (well actually, one of the things I\u2019m linking to is a story I wrote): https://instagram.com/bookreviewsbynairobi?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== and https://archiveofourown.org/works/38427709\n\nI will note that I actually do tend to \u201cnotice\u201d where others are looks wise. I am perhaps a shallow person, deep down inside. \n\nI actually do think that I may eventually have a child down the line, I\u2019d just like to be in a better place mentally and of course have a partner (I was partly so upset yesterday after I realized the guy doesn\u2019t want me, and likely will never text me, because I have grown up in a non-black environment and me not being terribly attractive has been emphasized because of it.)  \n\nI would describe myself as being someone who tends to overthink things. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t have a social life outside of school and work. I know that this is unhealthy. \n\nI still feel badly for my older brother even though he has wronged me before (said VERY aggressive things to me a year before he had a complete breakdown, I would have been in middle school.) I have found it easier to empathize with him as I have grown older since I have come to understand - and I didn\u2019t understand this when I was little - that our parents are abusive/bad people (to be fair, they \u201cchanged\u201d for a bit after I was born, more specifically my mother.)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/16jwb1k)", "clean_guess": "The text does not", "llm_guess": "The text does not", "logprobs": {"The": [{"token": "The", "logprob": -0.2687291}, {"token": "Vir", "logprob": -1.7374791}, {"token": "Cap", "logprob": -4.299979}, {"token": "This", "logprob": -4.565604}, {"token": "P", "logprob": -4.753104}, {"token": "Based", "logprob": -5.034354}, {"token": "Lib", "logprob": -5.331229}, {"token": "Gem", "logprob": -5.534354}, {"token": "C", "logprob": -6.206229}, {"token": "Ins", "logprob": -6.315604}, {"token": "There", "logprob": -6.378104}, {"token": "It", "logprob": -6.393729}, {"token": "Since", "logprob": -6.987479}, {"token": "Cannot", "logprob": -7.049979}, {"token": "Unable", "logprob": -7.112479}, {"token": "Not", "logprob": -7.924979}, {"token": "Aqu", "logprob": -7.924979}, {"token": "Given", "logprob": -8.159354}, {"token": "Due", "logprob": -8.206229}, {"token": "As", "logprob": -9.424979}], " text": [{"token": " text", "logprob": -0.0026843257}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -6.658934}, {"token": " z", "logprob": -7.346434}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -7.580809}, {"token": " Zodiac", "logprob": -9.23706}, {"token": " information", "logprob": -9.61206}, {"token": " subject", "logprob": -10.158935}, {"token": " passage", "logprob": -11.08081}, {"token": " presented", "logprob": -12.190185}, {"token": " available", "logprob": -12.533935}, {"token": " description", "logprob": -12.61206}, {"token": " person", "logprob": -13.033935}, {"token": " Text", "logprob": -13.39331}, {"token": " specific", "logprob": -13.815185}, {"token": " texts", "logprob": -13.908935}, {"token": " details", "logprob": -13.92456}, {"token": " astro", "logprob": -14.04956}, {"token": " document", "logprob": -14.08081}, {"token": " supplied", "logprob": -14.346435}, {"token": " mentioned", "logprob": -14.48706}], " does": [{"token": " does", "logprob": -0.06309534}, {"token": " doesn", "logprob": -2.8130953}, {"token": " provides", "logprob": -7.6724706}, {"token": " provided", "logprob": -7.9537206}, {"token": " is", "logprob": -8.39122}, {"token": " isn", "logprob": -10.39122}, {"token": " did", "logprob": -10.813095}, {"token": " gives", "logprob": -11.938095}, {"token": " do", "logprob": -12.656845}, {"token": " has", "logprob": -12.688095}, {"token": " didn", "logprob": -12.76622}, {"token": " lacks", "logprob": -12.844345}, {"token": " given", "logprob": -13.094345}, {"token": " contains", "logprob": -13.156845}, {"token": " above", "logprob": -13.73497}, {"token": " offers", "logprob": -13.781845}, {"token": " analysis", "logprob": -13.969345}, {"token": " hasn", "logprob": -14.14122}, {"token": " doe", "logprob": -14.781845}, {"token": " in", "logprob": -14.969345}], " not": [{"token": " not", "logprob": -5.080963e-06}, {"token": " provide", "logprob": -13.531255}, {"token": "'t", "logprob": -13.593755}, {"token": " no", "logprob": -13.750005}, {"token": "not", "logprob": -15.257817}, {"token": " NOT", "logprob": -15.445317}, {"token": " n", "logprob": -15.64063}, {"token": "n", "logprob": -16.242193}, {"token": " contain", "logprob": -16.460943}, {"token": " Not", "logprob": -16.554693}, {"token": " nto", "logprob": -16.70313}, {"token": " give", "logprob": -16.992193}, {"token": " nor", "logprob": -17.195318}, {"token": " include", "logprob": -17.570318}, {"token": " indicate", "logprob": -17.64063}, {"token": "\tnot", "logprob": -17.656256}, {"token": " have", "logprob": -17.750006}, {"token": " ", "logprob": -17.937506}, {"token": " note", "logprob": -17.992193}, {"token": " specify", "logprob": -18.26563}]}}
